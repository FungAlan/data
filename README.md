## Untapped Oil &amp; Gas Datathon ##

### What Is This? ###
This repository is being used to collect data in advance of the datathon event on October 12th to October 14th, 2018. You can submit data using the data upload tool below if you do not have collaborator access to this repository.

### How to Submit Data ###

### Option 1: Get Write Access ###
#### For power users ####
Please ask Drew for write access directly to the repository.

### Option 2: Use Data Upload Tool ###
#### For single file uploads for non-technical contributors ####
Visit https://sharp-edison-5440cb.netlify.com to access the upload tool. The form accepts any type of file, although it has inexplicably garbled Excel files, so please only use text or CSV. The metadata (currently just the description you enter in the upload tool) will be placed in a separate file that has the same name as your uploaded data file, but appended with .metadata.txt.
