### Pod Objectives 

1. Where in Alberta does there exist the most economic potential for geothermal power generation of geothermal heat source?

2. How does the distribution of wells with highest potential for geothermal energy relate to the location of:

  * existing oil and gas pools?
  * wells owned and operated by companies with high abandonment liability rating?
  
3. Whatâ€™s the geographical distribution of CO2 emitters in AB?

4. What oil and gas operators would benefit from geothermal power or heat use to minimize liabilities?

4b. What non-oil and gas industries would benefit from geothermal power or heat use to minimize emissions?

5. Run geo-clustering on the existing facilities (C02 emmitters) by size and ownership to see if you could identify multiple facilities that could be run by a single geothermal plant

6. What is the distribution of electric transmission lines in relation to geographical areas of high geothermal energy potential in AB?

7. Is there a way to run geothermal heat/power generation cost-effectively in Alberta?

  * What is the forecasted electricity price in Alberta for the next 10 years? 20 years?
  *	What needs to be cheaper to make this a reality?

### Data sources available

1. Interactive dashboard by NEXOV

2. National Pollutant Release Inventory dataset for Alberta

3. Liability Managment ratings from the Alberta Energy Regulator

4. University of Alberta report on geothermal energy potential in Alberta

5. Interactive pool maps from the Alberta Energy Regulator

6. Data from JWN : List of all Alberta Active or Suspended wells including the following fields :

  * General well characteristics (ie. Operator/Licensee, Field/Pool/Formation, Lat/Long, Objective, Total/Vertical Depth, Twn-Rng, etc...)
  * Temporal information (ie. License, Spud, Rig Release, Abandonment, last production dates).
  * Aggregated Gross Monthly Production (BOE, Oil, Condensate, Gas, Water)
  * Broken-down as last-reported, initial, current, 3/6/9/12mo trailing (ideally trailing from last production date, but need to discuss with the data guys)
  * Oilfield Atlas database, which will include generalized information on Facilities as follows:
  * Current operator
  * Lat/Long & Township (note that these are pretty fuzzy locations
