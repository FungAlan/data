# University of Alberta Deep Dive Analysis:

### Summary 
This study provides critical information to stakeholders for catalyzing the growth of an as-yet non-existent geothermal industry in Alberta. On a broader scale, this study provides a case study for quantifying regional scale geothermal resources in sedimentary basins. Although considerable amount of work remains to be done in order to bring a commercial geothermal project to fruition in Alberta, this study conclusively reveals a viable technical and potentially cost competitive geothermal resource base in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin.

### Municipal Districts analyzed

The study looks at four municipal districts in Alberta that would have potential for geothermal energy development. These four districts can be the starting point for further analysis with other data sources from the datathon.

* Grande Prairie
* Greenview
* Yellowhead
* Clearwater

### Geologic reservoirs analyzed:

The study looks at four geologic reservoirs (pools) within the four municipal districts discussed above.

* Leduc
* Swan Hills
* Granite Wash
* Gilwood

### Costs summary

The costs developing a geothermal resevoir using existing infrastructure are outlined in ***Table 11** and **Table 12**

### Metrics used

For each potential reservoir identified (above), the study calculated gross thermal and power capacity over a 30 year period. The following types of metrics were used to assess the geothermal potential :

* Thermal power potential (MWt) over a 30 year period
* Electrical power potential (MWe) over a 30 year period
* Flow rate required to producer 1megawatt of gross thermal (MWt) and electric (MWe) power.
* See figures 10 and 11 in the report.
