### Files ###

- *aer_dashboard.csv* - the "AER compliance dashboard" dataset provides information about energy incidents in the province. Unfortunately, the dataset is missing facilities' age data. Link to the AER webpage with detailed data description: http://www1.aer.ca/compliancedashboard/incidents.html
- *Well Characteristics.csv* - Production records for the queried wells. Can be joined against UWI, or aggregated against License #. Note that License # should be treated as a string, despite appearing as an integer.
