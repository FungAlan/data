The pipeline runs 1 km from a battery to the injection well. The Company estimates the released volume of produced water to be 75 to 100 m3. The salt/produced water has affected primarily agricultural land. The produced water ran east 1km along a natural channel to a seasonal water body. It is believed that the seasonal water body is contained and does not have an outflow. The spill site has been isolated from livestock. No wildlife impacts have been reported. Clean up operations are on-going. Update July 10, 2014 - The Company continues to remove pooled salt/produced water from the terrestrial portion of the impacted area. Further delineation of the seasonal water body indicates that the contamination has moved an additional 20m. The Company continues to develop plans to mitigate the impacts to the seasonal water body. No wildlife impacts have been reported.Update: July 11, 2014 - Produced water released near the break point has been completely removed. Bell holes in this area are no longer recharging with produced water. Vac trucks continue to remove produced water near the bottom of the spill path and it is believed that all produced water will be removed by today. Sampling showed that impacted water has been drawn back from the outer edges of the delineated area. Additives in the produced water were also revealed to have less impact than initially believed. Night crews will continue to remove contaminated water and dispose it to waste water disposal. Light plants have been brought to site and a safety review of site will be conducted for the night shift. No wildlife impacts have been reported. Update: July 12, 2014 - Site activity has plateaued as all necessary resources are being applied to the response.
