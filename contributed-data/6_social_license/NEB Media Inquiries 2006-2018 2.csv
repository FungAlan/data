It has a readership of 3,00,000 comprising design professionals, academicians and students. Also a widely read publication in other Asian countries, I-structure aims to offer our readers a comprehensive update on construction trends along with critique on related issues. Innovation in material application and breakthroughs in construction techniques are high points that signify the curiosity and progression in a design culture. We would like to to feature 'Alberta Clipper Pipeline Project'  in our forthcoming issue. For this we would need high resolution images, plans, renderings and structural information regarding the project. Hope that this would be feasible from your end. Looking forward to your reply. ","reply: Your feature idea is very technical.  The National Energy Board is the federal regulator that reviewed, and eventually approved, the project.  The National Energy Board also has a technical role in reviewing and approving engineering methods for the construction of the project.  But, I recommend that you contact the actual company, Enbridge, to try to pursue this idea, and not the regulator.  There are two main reasons for this.
First, Enbridge is best positioned to elaborate about its own project.  Second, the Alberta Clipper project is an international pipeline in both Canada and the USA.  However, we at the National Energy Board, are only responsible for the regulation of what is within our jurisdiction, in Canada.  One other thing I can do is direct you towards all of the publicly filed information about the project.  You will find technical information in here, too, likely under folder ""B"" - submissions about the project by Enbridge pipelines.

We do not have finalized data for months in 2009 just yet, however, this trend of increasing export volumes from Canada is expected to continue.  
 
You can find export volumes on our website at the following link http://www.neb-one.gc.ca/clf-nsi/rnrgynfmtn/sttstc/crdlndptrlmprdct/xprtsttstc-eng.html  
 
Among the many factors that might influence export volumes on a monthly or seasonal basis are fluctuations in demand, production setbacks and refinery outages.  Canada is a reliable and secure source of crude oil for the U.S.  Export volumes from Canada help offset lower U.S. imports from production areas that are in decline (eg. Mexico) or from areas that are less secure in terms of supply (eg. Venezuela, Middle East).

Furthermore, a company is required to provide all this information to the Board, which then assesses the sufficiency of the consultation program. If the Board is not satisfied that the consultation is sufficient, it can require the company to supplement its program.

More information about the Board’s expectations regarding company consultation programs is available in Chapter 3 of the NEB’s Filing Manual.

The Board’s December 16th Leave to Open (LTO) Order and PHMSA’s inspection order concern different matters. The Board’s LTO Order lifting the pressure restriction on Keystone allows TransCanada to now operate its pipeline at the approved Maximum Operating Pressure in Canada. The company had previously been operating under a pressure reduction in Canada related to the pipe that was converted from natural gas to oil service. TransCanada submitted an application as well as a fitness assessment indicating that the previous conditions set by the Board had been met and that the converted pipeline segments could be safely operated. The Board’s LTO Order does not change any regulatory requirements or restrictions that apply to the pipeline in the US, including the lower operating pressure. The Board and PHMSA are collaborating on the materials issue that gave rise to the PHMSA inspection order. Enbridge filed a copy of the repair plan with the NEB on December 1 as an Operations and Maintenance Notification.

There is no information in the preliminary incident report on how long it took before the leak was detected. However, the report indicates that H2S was released into the atmosphere for 55 minutes. This is the time it took for the H2S to clear the system after it was shut down.
According to a letter from Westcoast to the Transportation Safety Board, the initial investigation determined that the leak was caused by the failure of stem cap screws on a valve assembly. The root cause thereof has not been determined, but the investigation is continuing.

MBP was used in the past for gas export licences, and in KM LNG (GH-1-2011), it was determined that the MBP is applicable to LNG exports. The GH-1-2011 decision highlights the key features of the MBP that the Board considers for the granting of these licences, primarily a public hearing and ongoing monitoring by Board staff. MBP was designed to establish that the proposed export of natural gas is both surplus to reasonably foreseeable Canadian requirements, and is in the public interest.
2. Staff cannot provide a view of the Board on this question; however, each app is reviewed on a case-by-case basis using the MBP as a basis for staff analysis.

4.) Robyn Allan, a BC economist, asks this:
 
>> Either the CD Howe Institute is misrepresenting the presentation (but the only way to get to the luncheon is to be a member or be a members' guest) or the Chairman is engaging in entirely inappropriate activities by talking off the record about an industry he regulates.

3.) Is it appropriate for a regulator to give ""off the record"" talks to energy lobbyists?
 
4.) Robyn Allan, a BC economist, asks this:
 
>> Either the CD Howe Institute is misrepresenting the presentation (but the only way to get to the luncheon is to be a member or be a members' guest) or the Chairman is engaging in entirely inappropriate activities by talking off the record about an industry he regulates.
 
Any comment?

The speech that the Chair is scheduled to deliver at the C.D. Howe institute on January 13 is also not off-the record.

- What impact have delays in building new cross-border pipelines had in the big increase in rail exports?
- What is the NEB's outlook for future oil exports by rail?
- What particular U.S. markets are these exports going to (Gulf? Midwest? etc.)
","1. What explains the big jump in crude exported by rail between 2012 and 2013?
o There are a few reasons why we are seeing more crude exported by rail; however, all oil exports have seen increases.
o Existing oil pipelines are generally full, so shippers are using rail to get their product to market. 
o Rail also provides shippers with access to markets where there is no pipeline.
2. What impact have delays in building new cross-border pipelines had in the big increase in rail exports?
o One reason that crude by rail exports have increased is that existing oil pipelines are generally full. Rail also provides shippers with access to markets where there is no pipeline.
3. What is the NEB's outlook for future oil exports by rail?
o With all major crude export pipelines running near capacity, it is expected that rail will continue to play an important role in providing additional oil transportation capacity.
o In addition, exports of crude by rail are expected to grow as several new rail terminals with crude handling capabilities are commissioned across Western Canada. 
4. What particular U.S. markets are these exports going to (Gulf? Midwest? etc.)
Majority of crude exports by rail go to the East Coast and the Gulf. More info is available on our website 2013 Canadian Crude Oil Exports - By Export Transportation System Summary - 5 year trend

"2551","northern news services","2014-05-06","Would the NEB have a say in MVRB environmental assessments surrounding future on shore oil and gas development in the Mackenzie Valley? When would NEB input become part of any regulatory application in the NWT?
 
For example, if the Sahtu Land and Water Board were to flip Husky Energy's current application to drill and frack exploratory wells near Norman Wells to the Mackenzie Valley Review Board, would that trigger NEB involvement in the assessment process?
","Since 1 April Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) is responsible for the regulation of oil and gas activities in the NWT onshore, outside of the Inuvialuit Settlement Region (ISR) and the Norman Wells Proven Area. The NEB does not have a mandate to conduct environment assessments pursuant to the Mackenzie Valley Resource Management Act (MVRMA) for oil and gas projects within the jurisdiction of the GNWT.  
On March 4 2014 the NEB and GNWT signed a two year Service Agreement to allow the NEB to provide technical services and advice, upon request, for ongoing projects, and transfer records post-devolution. The Service Agreement also enables the NEB to provide any other services requested by the GNWT if the NEB has the resources and agrees to do so.

The GNWT would be the responsible regulator to carry out the MVRMA process for an application from Husky Energy to conduct exploratory drilling activity near Norman Wells.  The NEB would not be involved in an environmental assessment of this project before the Mackenzie Valley Environmental Impact Review Board, except if requested by GNWT to provide technical services or advice.  The NEB’s relationship with the MVEIRB remains the same in areas where the NEB is still the regulator (i.e. the Norman Wells proven area.)

Their recommendation is based on the evidence on the record, not on the number of people for or against the project.
• After considering more than 175,000 pages of evidence, and spending 884 hours listening to Canadians, the Panel found that Canada would be better off with the Enbridge Northern Gateway project than without it, if the project is built and operated in compliance with the 209 conditions.
• Furthermore, the Panel’s report includes nearly 500 pages clearly explaining their rationale for the decision. Their report speaks for itself.
• This report was focused on a broad list of issues that were thoroughly debated, studied and considered by the Panel in their review. The Panel considered whether the environmental impacts of bitumen production should be included in the review, however they concluded that connections to oil sands development were not sufficiently direct to include consideration of their environmental effects in the project assessment. The Panel did not have the authority to consider the consumption of oil sands products in Asia or elsewhere.
• In fact, some of the signatories to the May 28 letter to the Federal Government contributed their expertise and knowledge to the Northern Gateway Review.

"2643","nunavut news","2014-07-02","Questions on MKI Decision","1) Who made the decision and what is the rationale for making this
> decision?*
>
> The National Energy Board (NEB or Board) has approved a Geophysical
> Operations Authorization (GOA) application from TGS-NOPEC Geophysical
> Company ASA (TGS), Petroleum GeoServices (PGS) and Multi Klient Invest
> AS (MKI) to conduct a 2D offshore seismic survey program (the Project)
> in Baffin Bay and Davis Strait over five years during the open water
> season.  MKI will be the Project operator.
>
> The Board recognizes the importance of fostering better understanding
> and communication with all stakeholders that take part in Board
> processes. Due to the high degree of public interest in this
> application, the NEB authorized Board Member David Hamilton, under
> section 15 of the National Energy Board Act, to report and make
> recommendations on the Project application. The public was then invited
> to submit written comments to the Board and provide oral comments on the
> Project at public meetings.

>
> *2) What do you say to the Inuit who fear seismic testing will affect

>
> No work or activity proposed for the exploration of oil or gas under the

> satisfied that a company’s plans are safe for workers and will protect
> the environment.
>
> Never before has there been this level of public participation in the
> Board’s Environmental Assessment process for a Geophysical Operations
> Authorization. Written comments from the public and information gathered
> from community meetings informed Mr. Hamilton’s report, which was
> considered by the Board before making its decision. Various potential

>
> The NEB is of the view that, taking into account MKI’s implementation of

> the Project would not be likely to cause significant adverse

>
> The GOA issued by the Board is also subject to 15 conditions. The
> conditions include the requirements for MKI to make status updates of
> environmental commitments and marine mammal observer reports accessible
> to the public. The marine mammal observer reports may provide
> information on sightings of whales and birds in offshore areas that
> would not otherwise be available to the public. MKI is also required to

> outlines some options available.
>
> Decisions made by the NEB may be appealed to Canada’s Federal Court of
> Appeal on a point of law or jurisdiction if the Court grants permission
> (or leave) to appeal it. An appeal cannot be made simply because someone

"2671","toronto star","2014-07-21","1) Would you be able to tell me whether there is something different about the two projects that allows the NEB to consider an equivalency to same season relief wells when compared with conditions set out by the U.S. BOEM for this Shell project that requires a relief well?

2) Does the NEB believe that the time period for comments (until Aug. 1, 2014) was reasonable? Why not allow the public more time to comment on this in the fall, and why would the NEB put out its release on this topic in the middle of summer when some of the interested stakeholders may be on vacation?

3) Does the NEB have any response yet to this letter from NRDC alleging that the board has set a “dangerous precedent” for the Arctic by considering an equivalency to its same season relief well policy?
http://docs.nrdc.org/international/files/int_14071701a.pdf

4) Are there any precedents for the NEB allowing equivalency to a major policy on project proposals such as this one? Is the NEB considering the elimination altogether of its same season relief well policy for projects in this region?
","• The Board stated at the conclusion of its Review of Offshore Drilling in the Canadian Arctic that it was open to evolving technology and that it would consider departures from the Same Season Relief Well (SSRW) Policy on a case-by-case basis. Any applicant wishing to depart from the SSRW Policy must demonstrate how it would meet or exceed the intended outcome of the Policy.   
2) • The NEB received a letter from the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) on July 17 2014 requesting an extension to the public comment period on the draft List of Issues. The Board considered the request and on July 18 extended the deadline for public comment to August 15. See the filing at http://docs.neb-one.gc.ca/fetch.asp?language=E&ID=A61873  and at http://docs.neb-one.gc.ca/fetch.asp?language=E&ID=A61872. 
• At this stage the Board is interested in receiving comments on the issues, or topics, that should be considered when evaluating the proposals of Chevron and Imperial Oil. Those detailed proposals have not yet been filed. 
• The Board is committed to a process that facilitates public participation, and the accessibility of public information was noted by the Board in its decision to evaluate the proposals to be submitted
3) • The Board’s SSRW Policy is that the applicant must demonstrate, in its Contingency Plan, the capability to drill a relief well to kill an out-of-control well during the same drilling season. 
• The Board stated that it will continue to require that any company applying for an offshore drilling authorization provide us with specific details as to how they will either meet this policy, or meet or exceed the intended outcome of the policy, which is to minimize harmful impacts on the environment.
4)• The NEB stated in the Review of Offshore Drilling in the Canadian Arctic report that an applicant wishing to depart from the SSRW Policy would have to demonstrate to the NEB how they will meet or exceed the intended outcome of the SSRW policy. 
• The Board will determine, on a case-by-case basis, which tools are appropriate for meeting or exceeding the intended outcome of the SSRW Policy. The Board has stated that it will examine each application that comes before it on its own merits. 
• Both Imperial and Chevron have indicated that they intend to meet or exceed the intended outcome of the SSRW Policy. The Board has not indicated any intent to re-consider or eliminate its Policy, nor has it been asked to do so.
• Ultimately, drilling cannot occur in the Arctic unless the NEB is satisfied that drilling plans are safe for workers and the public, and that they will protect the environment.

The judicial review was submitted on time. Essentially it is 30 calendar days, but if the 30 days ends on a holiday (in this case a Saturday) then the 30 day period ends on the following business day – Monday July 28. Information on the deadline and computation of time is set out in the Federal Courts Act and  the Interpretation Act.

2) What is the process now? 
The next step is for the Applicants to file their affidavits and documentary exhibits in support of the judicial review application in accordance with the Federal Courts Rules. 

3) What does MKI have the authority to do in the meantime (I understand  they've chosen not to do anything until next year anyway)? Does an  appeal place any restrictions on their actions? 
I can confirm that the company has indicated that they will not begin operations until 2015. Unless a judge orders a stay or an injunction, there is nothing preventing MKI from beginning operations as per the terms and conditions attached to their approval. The Applicant in the judicial review has requested interim, interlocutory and permanent injunction restraining the Proponents from commencing the Project. The Court will decide whether to grant the request. 

4) What happens if the appeal is successful? 
I can’t speculate as to what would happen next, but will provide a plan of action after judicial review decision.

"2719","ohs canada","2014-08-21","1. Is the new filing requirement (in which companies regulated under the Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act (COGOA) have to disclose information on fracturing practices and fluids) fully operational? Does this include chemicals that are protected under the proprietary rights? 

2. Considering that unconventional drilling has only been around for about a decade, is there a need for greater regulatory enforcement with regards to fracking ops and disclosing the chemicals used in fracking?

3. What does the COGOA say with regards to worksite monitoring and worker protective measures surrounding hydraulic fracturing activities? Is this area being adequately enforced? 

4. Any recent developments surrounding regulations of hydraulic fracturing ops? 
","1. A) Is the new filing requirement (in which companies regulated under the Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act (COGOA) have to disclose information on fracturing practices and fluids) fully operational? 
Yes, the National Energy Board (NEB) is now fully online with FracFocus.ca The NEB requests regulated companies to disclose information on the hydraulic fracturing practices and fluids they use in their operations on the Fracfocus.ca website 30 days after the hydraulic fracturing operation has been completed.  
On October 30 2013 the NEB issued the first and only authorization to date for multi-stage hydraulic fracturing in horizontal wells in the North.  Those two wells were drilled last winter, and ConocoPhillips disclosed the chemicals used in the operation on the FracFocus.ca website.
1.  B) Does this include chemicals that are protected under the proprietary rights? 
Yes.  In cases where a company uses chemicals that are protected by Trademark, the NEB can  ask the regulated company to provide the information in a format which allows for public disclosure of the chemicals without revealing proprietary rights (i.e. they provide the ingredients, but not the recipe).  
2. Considering that unconventional drilling has only been around for about a decade, is there a need for greater regulatory enforcement with regards to fracking ops and disclosing the chemicals used in fracking?
The NEB has strong compliance and enforcement mechanisms in place under the Canada Oil and Gas Act (COGOA). The NEB reinforced and clarified its expectations of companies with the release of Filing Requirements for Onshore Drilling Operations Involving Hydraulic Fracturing in September 2013. In November 2013, the NEB also joined FracFocus.ca to support Canadians having ready access to important information on the process and understand how the NEB promotes safety and environmental protection for these types of activities. 
3. What does the COGOA say with regards to worksite monitoring and worker protective measures surrounding hydraulic fracturing activities? Is this area being adequately enforced? 
The NEB will not authorize any work or activity proposed for the exploration of oil or gas in the North unless it is satisfied that company’s plans are safe for workers and the public, and will protect the environment.
In addition to the following regulatory instruments, all NEB-regulated companies are also subject to Canada Labour Code Part II and the Oil and Gas Occupational Health and Safety Regulations.
• Canada Oil and Gas Drilling and Production Regulations
• Safety Plan Guidelines
• Environmental Protection Guidelines
• Filing Requirements for Onshore Drilling Operations Involving Hydraulic Fracturing
4. Any recent developments surrounding regulations of hydraulic fracturing ops? 
There have been no recent developments in regulation, however there has been a shift in regulatory responsibilities. On April 1, 2014, the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) became responsible for the regulation of oil and gas activities in the NWT onshore outside of the Inuvialuit Settlement Region and the Norman Wells Proven Area.  All of the regions in the Northwest Territories where there have been shale oil and gas exploration activities in the past three years are now regulated by the GNWT. 
I hope this is helpful. Please give me a call if you have any additional questions.

Since then, Trans Mountain has filed a motion with the NEB requesting an order under this section of the NEB Act. We will determine a process for reviewing that motion and decide whether or not to issue such an order.


As part of our hearing, we will be reviewing the records of Trans Mountains communications and consultation with the public. If we find that they have not done an adequate job, we can direct them to make improvements. Further more, the NEB Act says that companies must do as little damage as possible when conducting field work. If there is damage sustained then the landowner and company are to agree on the amount of compensation payable.  A company is required to make full compensation for any damage sustained. Should agreement not be reached normally the company or the landowner can serve notice of negotiation on the other and on the Minister or request that the matter be settle by arbitration through the Minister.

If this a written process for Trans Mountain, I would like someone to explain why the board still refers to oral hearings. Is it that submissions must be in writing, but that arguments will be oral? How TM process differs from previous pipeline hearings and, if so, it is related to the fact that, under changes in 2012, you only have 15 months to report. Some lawyers have criticized the board as refusing to consider upstream or downstream environmental effects, while at the same time considering the upstream economic benefits to the oil patch.

In the past, the NEB has used both oral and written processes, and often a combination of the two, to review an application. We have held hearings in the past which did not include oral cross examination. We have also had hearings in the past which were entirely carried out in a written process.  Our hearing processes are open and fair.  This includes meeting natural justice requirements.

We have more than 400 intervenors registered to participate in the Trans Mountain Pipeline hearing, which is more than any other hearing in the NEB’s history. In addition, we are expecting nearly 1,300 letters of comment from individuals and groups. 
We must be flexible in our hearing process so that the growing number of intervenors can participate in our hearings in a meaningful way.
The Trans Mountain Project hearings combines  written and oral hearing processes which include an  opportunity to file evidence, two rounds of written questions, four hearings to gather oral Aboriginal traditional evidence and the option of presenting written and oral final argument. 

All of the documents and evidence associated with this hearing are publically available on our website.  Public participation is an important element of an open and balanced regulatory process as it strengthens the quality and credibility of the process.

The Board’s decision on this matter were outlined in Ruling 50, and I have nothing to add.

• This is not an issue that has been raised with the Board. Our concern when reviewing a project like this is that a company demonstrates that it has an emergency management program that anticipates, prevents, manages and mitigates conditions during an emergency.

• The NEB is conducting a fair, thorough and rigorous review of this project.
• We review every motion and request that we receive on a case by case basis and make our decisions based on the facts and information that is placed before us.

- What impact have delays in building new cross-border pipelines had in the big increase in rail exports?
- What is the NEB's outlook for future oil exports by rail?
- What particular U.S. markets are these exports going to (Gulf? Midwest? etc.)
","1. What explains the big jump in crude exported by rail between 2012 and 2013?
o There are a few reasons why we are seeing more crude exported by rail; however, all oil exports have seen increases.
o Existing oil pipelines are generally full, so shippers are using rail to get their product to market. 
o Rail also provides shippers with access to markets where there is no pipeline.
2. What impact have delays in building new cross-border pipelines had in the big increase in rail exports?
o One reason that crude by rail exports have increased is that existing oil pipelines are generally full. Rail also provides shippers with access to markets where there is no pipeline.
3. What is the NEB's outlook for future oil exports by rail?
o With all major crude export pipelines running near capacity, it is expected that rail will continue to play an important role in providing additional oil transportation capacity.
o In addition, exports of crude by rail are expected to grow as several new rail terminals with crude handling capabilities are commissioned across Western Canada. 
4. What particular U.S. markets are these exports going to (Gulf? Midwest? etc.)
Majority of crude exports by rail go to the East Coast and the Gulf. More info is available on our website 2013 Canadian Crude Oil Exports - By Export Transportation System Summary - 5 year trend

"3234","northern news services","2014-05-06","Would the NEB have a say in MVRB environmental assessments surrounding future on shore oil and gas development in the Mackenzie Valley? When would NEB input become part of any regulatory application in the NWT?
 
For example, if the Sahtu Land and Water Board were to flip Husky Energy's current application to drill and frack exploratory wells near Norman Wells to the Mackenzie Valley Review Board, would that trigger NEB involvement in the assessment process?
","Since 1 April Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) is responsible for the regulation of oil and gas activities in the NWT onshore, outside of the Inuvialuit Settlement Region (ISR) and the Norman Wells Proven Area. The NEB does not have a mandate to conduct environment assessments pursuant to the Mackenzie Valley Resource Management Act (MVRMA) for oil and gas projects within the jurisdiction of the GNWT.  
On March 4 2014 the NEB and GNWT signed a two year Service Agreement to allow the NEB to provide technical services and advice, upon request, for ongoing projects, and transfer records post-devolution. The Service Agreement also enables the NEB to provide any other services requested by the GNWT if the NEB has the resources and agrees to do so.

The GNWT would be the responsible regulator to carry out the MVRMA process for an application from Husky Energy to conduct exploratory drilling activity near Norman Wells.  The NEB would not be involved in an environmental assessment of this project before the Mackenzie Valley Environmental Impact Review Board, except if requested by GNWT to provide technical services or advice.  The NEB’s relationship with the MVEIRB remains the same in areas where the NEB is still the regulator (i.e. the Norman Wells proven area.)

Their recommendation is based on the evidence on the record, not on the number of people for or against the project.
• After considering more than 175,000 pages of evidence, and spending 884 hours listening to Canadians, the Panel found that Canada would be better off with the Enbridge Northern Gateway project than without it, if the project is built and operated in compliance with the 209 conditions.
• Furthermore, the Panel’s report includes nearly 500 pages clearly explaining their rationale for the decision. Their report speaks for itself.
• This report was focused on a broad list of issues that were thoroughly debated, studied and considered by the Panel in their review. The Panel considered whether the environmental impacts of bitumen production should be included in the review, however they concluded that connections to oil sands development were not sufficiently direct to include consideration of their environmental effects in the project assessment. The Panel did not have the authority to consider the consumption of oil sands products in Asia or elsewhere.
• In fact, some of the signatories to the May 28 letter to the Federal Government contributed their expertise and knowledge to the Northern Gateway Review.

2) Does the NEB believe that the time period for comments (until Aug. 1, 2014) was reasonable? Why not allow the public more time to comment on this in the fall, and why would the NEB put out its release on this topic in the middle of summer when some of the interested stakeholders may be on vacation?

3) Does the NEB have any response yet to this letter from NRDC alleging that the board has set a “dangerous precedent” for the Arctic by considering an equivalency to its same season relief well policy?
http://docs.nrdc.org/international/files/int_14071701a.pdf

4) Are there any precedents for the NEB allowing equivalency to a major policy on project proposals such as this one? Is the NEB considering the elimination altogether of its same season relief well policy for projects in this region?
","• The Board stated at the conclusion of its Review of Offshore Drilling in the Canadian Arctic that it was open to evolving technology and that it would consider departures from the Same Season Relief Well (SSRW) Policy on a case-by-case basis. Any applicant wishing to depart from the SSRW Policy must demonstrate how it would meet or exceed the intended outcome of the Policy.   
2) • The NEB received a letter from the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) on July 17 2014 requesting an extension to the public comment period on the draft List of Issues. The Board considered the request and on July 18 extended the deadline for public comment to August 15. See the filing at http://docs.neb-one.gc.ca/fetch.asp?language=E&ID=A61873  and at http://docs.neb-one.gc.ca/fetch.asp?language=E&ID=A61872. 
• At this stage the Board is interested in receiving comments on the issues, or topics, that should be considered when evaluating the proposals of Chevron and Imperial Oil. Those detailed proposals have not yet been filed. 
• The Board is committed to a process that facilitates public participation, and the accessibility of public information was noted by the Board in its decision to evaluate the proposals to be submitted
3) • The Board’s SSRW Policy is that the applicant must demonstrate, in its Contingency Plan, the capability to drill a relief well to kill an out-of-control well during the same drilling season. 
• The Board stated that it will continue to require that any company applying for an offshore drilling authorization provide us with specific details as to how they will either meet this policy, or meet or exceed the intended outcome of the policy, which is to minimize harmful impacts on the environment.
4)• The NEB stated in the Review of Offshore Drilling in the Canadian Arctic report that an applicant wishing to depart from the SSRW Policy would have to demonstrate to the NEB how they will meet or exceed the intended outcome of the SSRW policy. 
• The Board will determine, on a case-by-case basis, which tools are appropriate for meeting or exceeding the intended outcome of the SSRW Policy. The Board has stated that it will examine each application that comes before it on its own merits. 
• Both Imperial and Chevron have indicated that they intend to meet or exceed the intended outcome of the SSRW Policy. The Board has not indicated any intent to re-consider or eliminate its Policy, nor has it been asked to do so.
• Ultimately, drilling cannot occur in the Arctic unless the NEB is satisfied that drilling plans are safe for workers and the public, and that they will protect the environment.

The judicial review was submitted on time. Essentially it is 30 calendar days, but if the 30 days ends on a holiday (in this case a Saturday) then the 30 day period ends on the following business day – Monday July 28. Information on the deadline and computation of time is set out in the Federal Courts Act and  the Interpretation Act.

2) What is the process now? 
The next step is for the Applicants to file their affidavits and documentary exhibits in support of the judicial review application in accordance with the Federal Courts Rules. 

3) What does MKI have the authority to do in the meantime (I understand  they've chosen not to do anything until next year anyway)? Does an  appeal place any restrictions on their actions? 
I can confirm that the company has indicated that they will not begin operations until 2015. Unless a judge orders a stay or an injunction, there is nothing preventing MKI from beginning operations as per the terms and conditions attached to their approval. The Applicant in the judicial review has requested interim, interlocutory and permanent injunction restraining the Proponents from commencing the Project. The Court will decide whether to grant the request. 

4) What happens if the appeal is successful? 
I can’t speculate as to what would happen next, but will provide a plan of action after judicial review decision.

On October 30 2013 the NEB issued the first and only authorization to date for multi-stage hydraulic fracturing in horizontal wells in the North.  Those two wells were drilled last winter, and ConocoPhillips disclosed the chemicals used in the operation on the FracFocus.ca website.
1.  B) Does this include chemicals that are protected under the proprietary rights? 
Yes.  In cases where a company uses chemicals that are protected by Trademark, the NEB can  ask the regulated company to provide the information in a format which allows for public disclosure of the chemicals without revealing proprietary rights (i.e. they provide the ingredients, but not the recipe).  
2. Considering that unconventional drilling has only been around for about a decade, is there a need for greater regulatory enforcement with regards to fracking ops and disclosing the chemicals used in fracking?
The NEB has strong compliance and enforcement mechanisms in place under the Canada Oil and Gas Act (COGOA). The NEB reinforced and clarified its expectations of companies with the release of Filing Requirements for Onshore Drilling Operations Involving Hydraulic Fracturing in September 2013. In November 2013, the NEB also joined FracFocus.ca to support Canadians having ready access to important information on the process and understand how the NEB promotes safety and environmental protection for these types of activities. 
3. What does the COGOA say with regards to worksite monitoring and worker protective measures surrounding hydraulic fracturing activities? Is this area being adequately enforced? 
The NEB will not authorize any work or activity proposed for the exploration of oil or gas in the North unless it is satisfied that company’s plans are safe for workers and the public, and will protect the environment.
In addition to the following regulatory instruments, all NEB-regulated companies are also subject to Canada Labour Code Part II and the Oil and Gas Occupational Health and Safety Regulations.
• Canada Oil and Gas Drilling and Production Regulations
• Safety Plan Guidelines
• Environmental Protection Guidelines
• Filing Requirements for Onshore Drilling Operations Involving Hydraulic Fracturing
4. Any recent developments surrounding regulations of hydraulic fracturing ops? 
There have been no recent developments in regulation, however there has been a shift in regulatory responsibilities. On April 1, 2014, the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) became responsible for the regulation of oil and gas activities in the NWT onshore outside of the Inuvialuit Settlement Region and the Norman Wells Proven Area.  All of the regions in the Northwest Territories where there have been shale oil and gas exploration activities in the past three years are now regulated by the GNWT. 
I hope this is helpful. Please give me a call if you have any additional questions.

If this a written process for Trans Mountain, I would like someone to explain why the board still refers to oral hearings. Is it that submissions must be in writing, but that arguments will be oral? How TM process differs from previous pipeline hearings and, if so, it is related to the fact that, under changes in 2012, you only have 15 months to report. Some lawyers have criticized the board as refusing to consider upstream or downstream environmental effects, while at the same time considering the upstream economic benefits to the oil patch.

In the past, the NEB has used both oral and written processes, and often a combination of the two, to review an application. We have held hearings in the past which did not include oral cross examination. We have also had hearings in the past which were entirely carried out in a written process.  Our hearing processes are open and fair.  This includes meeting natural justice requirements.

We have more than 400 intervenors registered to participate in the Trans Mountain Pipeline hearing, which is more than any other hearing in the NEB’s history. In addition, we are expecting nearly 1,300 letters of comment from individuals and groups. 
We must be flexible in our hearing process so that the growing number of intervenors can participate in our hearings in a meaningful way.
The Trans Mountain Project hearings combines  written and oral hearing processes which include an  opportunity to file evidence, two rounds of written questions, four hearings to gather oral Aboriginal traditional evidence and the option of presenting written and oral final argument. 

All of the documents and evidence associated with this hearing are publically available on our website.  Public participation is an important element of an open and balanced regulatory process as it strengthens the quality and credibility of the process.

3. Reviewing the 50+ rulings NEB has made so far, it seems like the rulings are disproportionately in favour of Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain. Do you have any comments about why this has been the case? ","• This seems like a question that is more appropriately directed to Kinder Morgan. The Board’s decision on this matter were outlined in Ruling 50, and I have nothing to add.

• This is not an issue that has been raised with the Board. Our concern when reviewing a project like this is that a company demonstrates that it has an emergency management program that anticipates, prevents, manages and mitigates conditions during an emergency.

• The NEB is conducting a fair, thorough and rigorous review of this project.
• We review every motion and request that we receive on a case by case basis and make our decisions based on the facts and information that is placed before us.

Q. Eventually however, did the NEB grant EPA “commenter” status? When? Did the EPA send its “comments” in yet to NEB? 

[2] Has the EPA asked to submit in any other format than “commenter” since June 2014? When, how?

[3] From what I can tell from the website, NEB never actually sent out an offer to consult as contemplated by Section 18 of the CEAA. Is this right? 
 
[4] Has the Washington state Department of Ecology – with its intervenor status – sent in records?

[5]  I read online that: “Over 2,000 participants applied in time for the deadline, including Lummi, Suquamish, Tulalip and Swinomish Nation from Washington State. The EPA ATP was one of 2,118 reviewed. The board denied 468 participation requests. The ruling grated 400 ATPs for intervener status but bumped another 452 down a level to the commenter role.” Is that right?  

[6] What if anything was EPA’s input to the joint NEB-CEAA process on Enbridge Inc.'s Northern Gateway proposal for its Kitimat outlet? 

[7] Is this right - Board-approved commenters’ deadline to file comments is now 23 July 2015. Board-approved intervenors’ next deadline is Evidence filing due 27 May 2015

[8] Do the Lummi, Suquamish, Tulalip and Swinomish Nations have full intervenor status, and what have they sent in to NEB?

By withdrawing from the process, she will no longer be able to contribute to the review or influence the Board’s recommendation.
We consider public involvement to be a fundamental component throughout the lifecycle of a project - from project design to abandonment - in order to address the potential impacts of that project.
The Board will hear from those who are directly affected by the Project and from many participants who have relevant information or expertise to share. There are approximately 400 interveners and 1,300 commenters in this hearing.  
Our hearing processes are designed to be flexible to meet the needs of the wide range of applications we receive. The Board chose to test the evidence using a written format for questioning so that all intervenors have an opportunity to participate meaningfully. In our experience, written responses to questions such as these can be an appropriate way to test the evidence.
The review of this application will be no less rigorous compared to past reviews. 
We are committed to a thorough and fair environmental assessment and regulatory review of the Project. This application will be subject to full review pursuant to the requirements of the NEB Act and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012.

I am working with a 1 p.m. deadline. That's one hour from now, so I will keep these short and I guess that means you will also have to keep your answers shortish given time constraints. 
 
Questions:
 
How is this going to affect proposed pipelines and proposed LNG facilities in B.C.?
 
Being that I am here in northeast B.C., I am wondering -  does this mean that the NEB predicts an even greater downturn in natural gas activity in this area?
 
Report states: ""While decreased capital expenditures caused by declining oil prices are expected to reduce total deliverability, high-grading by producers to pursue the best targets in both Canada and the U.S. may improve per-well deliverability.""
 
What is high-grading and how exactly will it improve the market oversupply situation? 
","A. No immediate impact due to the different time frames. Deliveries into a future major LNG project will likely be at least five years away and the start of actual construction of an LNG project would provide the impetus for greater drilling in Western Canada in the intervening years. 
A. We are anticipating a downturn in deliverability in 2015, largely due to the drop in drilling activity during the winter season of 2014-15. After 2015 we expect drilling and deliverability to gradually increase through 2017, although not returning to 2014 levels in that period.
A. When the amount of investment capital available to industry tightens, producers and service companies attempt to reduce costs while focusing their drilling efforts on the most economic prospects – this is commonly referred to as ‘high-grading’. In practice, the industry is focusing on it’s best prospects and drilling them using the best equipment and crews to achieve maximum efficiency. As there is less overall activity, delivery of materials to the drill site is also improved resulting in less downtime. The effect is “doing more with less” in terms of getting higher average deliverability from the wells being drilled.

","The Board released an initial set of draft conditions on 16 April 2014.  The current schedule (Procedural Direction No. 12) has the Board releasing draft conditions on 29 July 2015 (note that the schedule is revised from time to time).

The Board is required by the National Energy Board Act, regardless of its overall recommendation for or against the Trans Mountain Expansion Project, to include in its report any terms & conditions the project would be subject to should the Governor-in-Council approve the project. As a result of this requirement, the release of draft conditions does not signify anything regarding the Board’s recommendation for or against the project.

The purpose of releasing draft conditions in advance of the Board’s recommendation is to obtain comments from Trans Mountain and Intervenors as part of their written argument. Trans Mountain and all Intervenors will be able to provide comments on draft conditions as part of their written argument  (Trans Mountain must file it’s written argument by 20 August 2015 and Intervenors must file theirs by 3 September 2015 as set out in Procedural Direction No. 12).

As such, the Board requires larger pipeline companies to establish a trust fund to pay for the cost of decommissioning or abandoning its NEB-regulated pipelines. Smaller companies are required to post letters of credit or surety bonds. Very few companies are exempt from this requirement. Exemptions are provided, for example, for companies that are government-owned.

 The mayor of Burnaby and other cities are angry at the NEB process, saying that the process is “deeply flawed” and biased towards Kinder Morgan. They say you are allowing no cross-examination of  Kinder Morgan officials and refusing to force the company to answer many written questions. Does the NEB have a response to this? 

 And lastly, is it correct that some interveners are no longer testifying? Are you still expecting 76 individuals to testify at the Burnaby hearings? Have any formally pulled out? 
","• Trans Mountain will present its final argument in advance of intervenors’ final argument so that intervenors have time to prepare and include responses to Trans Mountain’s argument in their own written argument-in-chief and reply submissions.
• The Board has, and will continue to hear, from those who are directly affected by the Project and from many participants who have relevant information or expertise to share. Approximately 400 intervenors and 1,300 commenters are participating in this hearing. The hearing included an opportunity to file evidence, two opportunities to ask Trans Mountain written questions, four hearings to hear oral Aboriginal traditional evidence, and Letters of Comment, the option of both written argument and oral summary argument.
• The Board chose to test the evidence using a written format for questioning so that all intervenors have an opportunity to participate meaningfully. With 400 intervenors, there will be a significant amount of evidence to review, from highly technical information, to local environmental concerns. In our experience, written responses to questions such as these are an appropriate and transparent way to test the evidence.
• We are still expecting that the 76 intervenors that registered to provide oral summary argument will do so. The two intervenors that withdrew from the process last week had not registered to provide oral summary argument.

Regards,
","The preliminary reports from the company are that it was an Amine release that prompted the company to shut the plant down on November 26th, 2015. Although a hazardous substance, reports from the company are that the Amine concentration was low and limited in duration.  Without knowing more information, it is difficult to draw conclusions from the table. We have three inspection staff, including our Chief Safety Officer, who will be performing an inspection of the Pine River Gas Plant early next week and begin gathering information on the causes that led to the incident. Currently,we are managing the situation remotely and are in regular contact with the company. We are continuously assessing the situation and are responsive to any changes in status or the level of risk. The company is required to submit an event summary to the NEB that includes the causes and corrective actions taken. In addition they must provide a start-up plan. Based on the information, an NEB Inspection Officer, with input from our Safety, Engineering, and Environment experts, will determine whether the Order can be lifted.

The Board does not decide what weight, if any, to give any evidence until it has heard final argument and the record is closed.
Ms. Allan’s or other intervenors’ views regarding the appropriateness or reliability of this or any other evidence filed by Trans Mountain are properly put to the Board through that intervenor’s evidence and/or final argument. Striking evidence from the record would prevent other intervenors from testing it and presenting their views to the Board in the same manner that Ms. Allan is now doing.”
All NEB decisions are subject to independent and impartial judicial oversight, generally through the Federal Court of Appeal and Supreme Court of Canada. No one, including Ms. Allan, sought a Board review or court appeal, or raised any concerns with the Board after ruling 24 was issued.
The record on this hearing has not yet closed. Trans Mountain will submit final argument next week, and intervenors will have an opportunity to  submit final argument in January. Final argument provides participants the opportunity to persuade the NEB to take certain positions on the issues and evidence at hand and on the Project as a whole.

"4210","vancouver sun","2016-01-08","Is it true there are expiry dates to approval of the Northern Gateway pipeline.
• Construction must begin before Dec 31, 2016
• And Enbridge must secure commitments for 60 % of capacity six months before construction starts.
How firm are these expiry dates?
What happens if these dates are not met?
Is approval rescinded?
Other?
Can a company apply for an exertion to these dates?
If yes, has the NEB provided extensions in the past?
Can you provide an example?
","Yes, the project has a sunset date which sets a date of Dec 31, 2016.
 
“Unless the NEB otherwise directs prior to 31 December 2016, the certificate will expire on 31 December 2016, unless construction of the pipeline or the Kitimat Terminal has commenced by that date.”

Regarding securing commitments for capacity – check out condition #20. The company has submitted some interim filings related to this condition (the last one Dec 21). 

In addition to the 31 Dec 2016 sunset clause, there are time limits placed on several conditions as they relate to various stages of construction or operation (i.e. XXX must be completed 90 days before construction may commence). Only when the NEB is satisfied that the information the company files meets the requirements of a specific condition will the company be authorized to proceed with activities associated with that condition.

Conditions imposed on a project are designed to protect the public and the environment. The company must comply with all conditions set out in a certificate. If conditions are not met, a company may not be able to begin various stages of construction or operation and they may also be assessed administrative monetary penalties.

The NEB does grant extensions and variances from time to time, provided the applicant has sufficiently justified the need for an extension. An example is Imperial’s request currently before the Board for an extension to the Mackenzie Gas Project.

This discussion is referenced in decisions as early as 1994.  

More recently, during the Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipeline public hearing, the NEB heard from many individuals who said that the NEB should consider the environmental impacts of bitumen extraction, including the production of greenhouse gases and related effects on climate change. 

The Panel concluded that connections to oil sands development were not sufficiently direct to allow consideration of their environmental effects in its assessment of the project, other than in its consideration of cumulative effects.  The Panel did consider emissions arising from construction activities, pipeline operations, and the operation of tankers in Canadian waters to be within the scope of its assessment.

To clarify, I was wondering if the Board can explain how it decided extra days on cross-examination were not required and what evidence it can provide to show that this decision does not open the door to legal challenges about its eventual recommendations?

2) Does this news article accurately quote the NEB when it states that Peter Watson was involved in the process of the nomination of Steven Kelly? If so, can you tell me if Mr. Watson advised the government, at that time, of the risks of appointing Mr. Kelly in terms of maintaining the NEB’s public trust and credibility? http://www.burnabynow.com/news/kinder-morgan-presenting-evidence-back-up-plan-friday-1.2039466

3) Can you provide an explanation for the lines in the briefing notes that state that Robyn Allan’s letter was “incorrect” in stating that the NEB “sanctioned” a $136 million fund for Kinder Morgan to use as part of the hearings. Was the NEB trying to use a play on words to confuse or obfuscate its role in 2011 when it approved KM’s treatment of the firm service fee to advance incremental costs?

4) Overall, Ms Allan has alleged in an interview that the NEB is giving misleading and inaccurate advice to the government, putting the minister and his job at risk by failing to give him proper context and evaluation of Board actions and the consequences of those actions. One additional example she noted was that the briefing binder failed to notify the minister about Board appointments made by the previous government, prior to terms expiring. These appointments resulted in public criticism of the government and put it at political risk, Allan alleged. Can the NEB provide me with a response to the allegation that it isn’t properly briefing the minister and the government?

Q. Eventually however, did the NEB grant EPA “commenter” status? When? Did the EPA send its “comments” in yet to NEB? 

[2] Has the EPA asked to submit in any other format than “commenter” since June 2014? When, how?

[3] From what I can tell from the website, NEB never actually sent out an offer to consult as contemplated by Section 18 of the CEAA. Is this right? 
 
[4] Has the Washington state Department of Ecology – with its intervenor status – sent in records?

[5]  I read online that: “Over 2,000 participants applied in time for the deadline, including Lummi, Suquamish, Tulalip and Swinomish Nation from Washington State. The EPA ATP was one of 2,118 reviewed. The board denied 468 participation requests. The ruling grated 400 ATPs for intervener status but bumped another 452 down a level to the commenter role.” Is that right?  

[6] What if anything was EPA’s input to the joint NEB-CEAA process on Enbridge Inc.'s Northern Gateway proposal for its Kitimat outlet? 

[7] Is this right - Board-approved commenters’ deadline to file comments is now 23 July 2015. Board-approved intervenors’ next deadline is Evidence filing due 27 May 2015

[8] Do the Lummi, Suquamish, Tulalip and Swinomish Nations have full intervenor status, and what have they sent in to NEB?

As an intervener in the process she had an opportunity to influence review of the application. By withdrawing from the process, she will no longer be able to contribute to the review or influence the Board’s recommendation.
We consider public involvement to be a fundamental component throughout the lifecycle of a project - from project design to abandonment - in order to address the potential impacts of that project.
The Board will hear from those who are directly affected by the Project and from many participants who have relevant information or expertise to share. There are approximately 400 interveners and 1,300 commenters in this hearing.  
Our hearing processes are designed to be flexible to meet the needs of the wide range of applications we receive. The Board chose to test the evidence using a written format for questioning so that all intervenors have an opportunity to participate meaningfully. In our experience, written responses to questions such as these can be an appropriate way to test the evidence.
The review of this application will be no less rigorous compared to past reviews. 
We are committed to a thorough and fair environmental assessment and regulatory review of the Project. This application will be subject to full review pursuant to the requirements of the NEB Act and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012.

"4451","alaska highway news","2015-06-23","A few questions on the above noted release (link below).
 
I am working with a 1 p.m. deadline. That's one hour from now, so I will keep these short and I guess that means you will also have to keep your answers shortish given time constraints. 
 
Questions:
 
How is this going to affect proposed pipelines and proposed LNG facilities in B.C.?
 
Being that I am here in northeast B.C., I am wondering -  does this mean that the NEB predicts an even greater downturn in natural gas activity in this area?
 
Report states: ""While decreased capital expenditures caused by declining oil prices are expected to reduce total deliverability, high-grading by producers to pursue the best targets in both Canada and the U.S. may improve per-well deliverability.""
 
What is high-grading and how exactly will it improve the market oversupply situation? 
","A. No immediate impact due to the different time frames. Deliveries into a future major LNG project will likely be at least five years away and the start of actual construction of an LNG project would provide the impetus for greater drilling in Western Canada in the intervening years. 
A. We are anticipating a downturn in deliverability in 2015, largely due to the drop in drilling activity during the winter season of 2014-15. After 2015 we expect drilling and deliverability to gradually increase through 2017, although not returning to 2014 levels in that period.
A. When the amount of investment capital available to industry tightens, producers and service companies attempt to reduce costs while focusing their drilling efforts on the most economic prospects – this is commonly referred to as ‘high-grading’. In practice, the industry is focusing on it’s best prospects and drilling them using the best equipment and crews to achieve maximum efficiency. As there is less overall activity, delivery of materials to the drill site is also improved resulting in less downtime. The effect is “doing more with less” in terms of getting higher average deliverability from the wells being drilled.

> 
> 1) what is draft conditions and what does that imply as far as approval is concerned?
> 
> 2) will Kinder Morgan be given a specific time to take a look at the draft?
","The Board released an initial set of draft conditions on 16 April 2014.  The current schedule (Procedural Direction No. 12) has the Board releasing draft conditions on 29 July 2015 (note that the schedule is revised from time to time).

The Board is required by the National Energy Board Act, regardless of its overall recommendation for or against the Trans Mountain Expansion Project, to include in its report any terms & conditions the project would be subject to should the Governor-in-Council approve the project. As a result of this requirement, the release of draft conditions does not signify anything regarding the Board’s recommendation for or against the project.

The purpose of releasing draft conditions in advance of the Board’s recommendation is to obtain comments from Trans Mountain and Intervenors as part of their written argument. Trans Mountain and all Intervenors will be able to provide comments on draft conditions as part of their written argument  (Trans Mountain must file it’s written argument by 20 August 2015 and Intervenors must file theirs by 3 September 2015 as set out in Procedural Direction No. 12).

As such, the Board requires larger pipeline companies to establish a trust fund to pay for the cost of decommissioning or abandoning its NEB-regulated pipelines. Smaller companies are required to post letters of credit or surety bonds. Very few companies are exempt from this requirement. Exemptions are provided, for example, for companies that are government-owned.

 The mayor of Burnaby and other cities are angry at the NEB process, saying that the process is “deeply flawed” and biased towards Kinder Morgan. They say you are allowing no cross-examination of  Kinder Morgan officials and refusing to force the company to answer many written questions. Does the NEB have a response to this? 

 And lastly, is it correct that some interveners are no longer testifying? Are you still expecting 76 individuals to testify at the Burnaby hearings? Have any formally pulled out? 
","• Trans Mountain will present its final argument in advance of intervenors’ final argument so that intervenors have time to prepare and include responses to Trans Mountain’s argument in their own written argument-in-chief and reply submissions.
• The Board has, and will continue to hear, from those who are directly affected by the Project and from many participants who have relevant information or expertise to share. Approximately 400 intervenors and 1,300 commenters are participating in this hearing. The hearing included an opportunity to file evidence, two opportunities to ask Trans Mountain written questions, four hearings to hear oral Aboriginal traditional evidence, and Letters of Comment, the option of both written argument and oral summary argument.
• The Board chose to test the evidence using a written format for questioning so that all intervenors have an opportunity to participate meaningfully. With 400 intervenors, there will be a significant amount of evidence to review, from highly technical information, to local environmental concerns. In our experience, written responses to questions such as these are an appropriate and transparent way to test the evidence.
• We are still expecting that the 76 intervenors that registered to provide oral summary argument will do so. The two intervenors that withdrew from the process last week had not registered to provide oral summary argument.

The letter asks the NEB to start again from the beginning with the appointment of a new panel to review the project. 

I was wondering if the NEB has a response to this. 
","The NEB is an independent, arms-length regulator that operates much like a court. The NEB conducts independent public environmental assessments and regulatory reviews of all major projects within its jurisdiction.
The TMX hearing panel has taken appropriate action to address the appointment by deciding to strike the evidence prepared by Mr. Kelly from the hearing record.

Although a hazardous substance, reports from the company are that the Amine concentration was low and limited in duration.  Without knowing more information, it is difficult to draw conclusions from the table. We have three inspection staff, including our Chief Safety Officer, who will be performing an inspection of the Pine River Gas Plant early next week and begin gathering information on the causes that led to the incident. Currently,we are managing the situation remotely and are in regular contact with the company. We are continuously assessing the situation and are responsive to any changes in status or the level of risk. The company is required to submit an event summary to the NEB that includes the causes and corrective actions taken. In addition they must provide a start-up plan. Based on the information, an NEB Inspection Officer, with input from our Safety, Engineering, and Environment experts, will determine whether the Order can be lifted. Other processing facilities within the province are regulated by the BC Oil and Gas Commission","2015-11-27","print & online","safety and environmental protection"

The Board does not decide what weight, if any, to give any evidence until it has heard final argument and the record is closed.
Ms. Allan’s or other intervenors’ views regarding the appropriateness or reliability of this or any other evidence filed by Trans Mountain are properly put to the Board through that intervenor’s evidence and/or final argument. Striking evidence from the record would prevent other intervenors from testing it and presenting their views to the Board in the same manner that Ms. Allan is now doing.”
All NEB decisions are subject to independent and impartial judicial oversight, generally through the Federal Court of Appeal and Supreme Court of Canada. No one, including Ms. Allan, sought a Board review or court appeal, or raised any concerns with the Board after ruling 24 was issued.
The record on this hearing has not yet closed. Trans Mountain will submit final argument next week, and intervenors will have an opportunity to  submit final argument in January. Final argument provides participants the opportunity to persuade the NEB to take certain positions on the issues and evidence at hand and on the Project as a whole.

• And Enbridge must secure commitments for 60 % of capacity six months before construction starts.
How firm are these expiry dates?
What happens if these dates are not met?
Is approval rescinded?
Other?
Can a company apply for an exertion to these dates?
If yes, has the NEB provided extensions in the past?
Can you provide an example?
","Yes, the project has a sunset date which sets a date of Dec 31, 2016.
 
“Unless the NEB otherwise directs prior to 31 December 2016, the certificate will expire on 31 December 2016, unless construction of the pipeline or the Kitimat Terminal has commenced by that date.”

Regarding securing commitments for capacity – check out condition #20. The company has submitted some interim filings related to this condition (the last one Dec 21). 

In addition to the 31 Dec 2016 sunset clause, there are time limits placed on several conditions as they relate to various stages of construction or operation (i.e. XXX must be completed 90 days before construction may commence). Only when the NEB is satisfied that the information the company files meets the requirements of a specific condition will the company be authorized to proceed with activities associated with that condition.

Conditions imposed on a project are designed to protect the public and the environment. The company must comply with all conditions set out in a certificate. If conditions are not met, a company may not be able to begin various stages of construction or operation and they may also be assessed administrative monetary penalties.

The NEB does grant extensions and variances from time to time, provided the applicant has sufficiently justified the need for an extension. An example is Imperial’s request currently before the Board for an extension to the Mackenzie Gas Project.

More recently, during the Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipeline public hearing, the NEB heard from many individuals who said that the NEB should consider the environmental impacts of bitumen extraction, including the production of greenhouse gases and related effects on climate change. 

The Panel concluded that connections to oil sands development were not sufficiently direct to allow consideration of their environmental effects in its assessment of the project, other than in its consideration of cumulative effects.

To clarify, I was wondering if the Board can explain how it decided extra days on cross-examination were not required and what evidence it can provide to show that this decision does not open the door to legal challenges about its eventual recommendations?

2) Does this news article accurately quote the NEB when it states that Peter Watson was involved in the process of the nomination of Steven Kelly? If so, can you tell me if Mr. Watson advised the government, at that time, of the risks of appointing Mr. Kelly in terms of maintaining the NEB’s public trust and credibility? http://www.burnabynow.com/news/kinder-morgan-presenting-evidence-back-up-plan-friday-1.2039466

3) Can you provide an explanation for the lines in the briefing notes that state that Robyn Allan’s letter was “incorrect” in stating that the NEB “sanctioned” a $136 million fund for Kinder Morgan to use as part of the hearings. Was the NEB trying to use a play on words to confuse or obfuscate its role in 2011 when it approved KM’s treatment of the firm service fee to advance incremental costs?

4) Overall, Ms Allan has alleged in an interview that the NEB is giving misleading and inaccurate advice to the government, putting the minister and his job at risk by failing to give him proper context and evaluation of Board actions and the consequences of those actions. One additional example she noted was that the briefing binder failed to notify the minister about Board appointments made by the previous government, prior to terms expiring. These appointments resulted in public criticism of the government and put it at political risk, Allan alleged. Can the NEB provide me with a response to the allegation that it isn’t properly briefing the minister and the government?

"4831","argus media","2016-05-23","Fort McMurray Wildfire","1. What is the impact of wildfires in Fort McMurray, Alberta on Canadian NGL production? – What was NGL production in January-April 2016 vs January-April 2015?

o The expected impact of the wildfires on NGL production in Alberta is expected to be small and temporary. The majority of Alberta’s NGL production comes from natural gas processing and not from the oil sands. While there were some reductions in natural gas receipts in Alberta during the first half of May, gas production is expected to return to normal as soon as oil sands operations return to meet gas demands in the oil sands.
o Any impacts to NGL production would be limited to off-gas production of ethane, propane, and butanes from oil sands facilities – however, off-gas production accounts for a relatively small proportion of total NGL production in Alberta. Shell’s Scotford upgrader was restarted last week, restoring part of the off-gas production that was lost due to the wildfires.
o The majority of Alberta’s natural gas production and NGL processing facilities are located far away from the Fort McMurray wildfires. 
o Alberta NGL production is only available up to February 2016. By February 2016, C2 production totaled 2,376 thousand m3 (2,198 thousand m3 in 2015) was C3 production was 1,641 thousand m3 (1,438 thousand m3 in 2015); C4 was 909 thousand m3 (849 thousand m3 in 2015).

2. Does the situation in Fort McMurray impact exports or may have an effect in the upcoming months? – What were the export levels in January-April 2016 vs January-April 2015?

o Given the expected low impact of the wildfires on NGL production in Alberta, we are not expecting any impact on propane or butane exports.
o The latest export data available for Canadian propane exports is to March 2016. Canadian exports for the first three months of 2015 were 21.2 thousand m3/d, while in the same period of 2016 propane exports were 23.3 thousand m3/d – a 9.6 per cent year-over-year increase. 
o The latest export data available for Canadian butanes exports is to March 2016. Canadian exports for the first three months of 2015 were 2.9 thousand m3/d, while in the same period of 2016 butanes exports were 2.8 thousand m3/d – a 3.4 per cent year-over-year decrease.

"4849","national observer","2016-06-07","Would the NEB be able to provide a response to some comments made by Elizabeth May earlier today regarding its decision to accept evidence from spill studies by Kinder Morgan - in the course of the recent review of the Trans Mountain expansion project - without allowing the scientists who conducted the studies to be cross-examined.

Ms. May described the experiments as being shoddy and unscientific. In one case, she said water was put into a tank and mixed with salt water on a hot day that allowed the temperatures to rise higher than they would on the Vancouver coast. She also said another experiment consisted of mixing oil and water in a plastic bucket.

She noted that the NEB also agreed to Kinder Morgan’s objections to exclude a Royal Society of Canada report from evidence considered in the hearings.

Based on this and many other factors, Ms. May has said she would soon ask for a judicial review of the NEB’s decision.
Does the NEB believe it has a strong enough case to win such a legal challenge, based on the examples that she provided today?","to Ruling 14 which addressed motions for cross examination by Ms. May and Ms. Allan. 

All evidence submitted by Trans Mountain and intervenors was subject to testing through our written information request process. Here is a link to some information on the testing of evidence. 

In the Trans Mountain hearing, intervenors had two separate opportunities to ask questions regarding evidence filed. In addition intervenors were able to present their own evidence, and final argument.
In addition to Trans Mountain’s evidence, the Board considered evidence about spills from a variety of intervenors including Ms. May, the City of Vancouver, the City of Burnaby,  Tsawout First Nation, and Tsleil-Waututh Nation.

The Board considered all evidence and arguments, including evidence on spill costs, from Trans Mountain and all intervenors equally when deliberating on its recommendation. For further details regarding the Board’s analysis and views of Project-related increase in shipping activities see Chapter 14 of the report.


Regarding your question about a report from the Royal Society of Canada – I cannot find any reference to this on the hearing record, nor did any hearing participant seek to file such a document. Can you provide further clarification of which report you are referring to?

“The Board accepts renewable energy will be increasingly important in the years ahead; however, the Board is of the view that world demand for crude oil is likely to continue to increase over the next 20 years.

National Energy Board Safety Advisory – Safety Advisory related to 
Canadian Standards Association – Z662-15 (Standard) Non-Mandatory Annex 
Clause K.5.3.4.3.1 Errata
Can you tell me what the effects of using the incorrect calculation 
could be? How serious of an issue is this?
Does this impact all companies operating pipelines? Or only 
""companies that specialize in the area of fracture mechanics."" (I'm 
taking that quote about companies from the Safety Advisory.)
","You may wish to follow up with Sue Capper at the Canadian Standards Association sue.capper@csagroup.org .

In July 2015 the Canadian Standards Association made changes to CSA Z662 Annex K– a non-mandatory annex that utilized fracture mechanics principles to determine acceptable defect criteria in welding.  The changes to Annex K included the addition of a new equation which calculated the critical flaw size (acceptable imperfections) in welds on large scale pipelines. In late 2015 an error in the equation was identified and an erratum with the correct equation was subsequently issued in March 2016. (you can find more information with the Canadian Standards Association https://community.csagroup.org/login.jspa?referer=%252Findex.jspa) 

As a proactive measure, the NEB alerted its regulated companies to the error in Annex K and issued a Safety Order. No reportable incidents on NEB-regulated pipelines have occurred as a result of the incorrect equation. The public safety risk resulting from this calculation error is considered to be low.","n/a","online","safety and environmental protection"

That said, the NEB is monitoring the situation closely and has offered assistance to Environment & Climate Change Canada, which is coorNAME REMOVEDting the federal response. Canada has more than 760,000 kilometres of pipelines that transport oil and gas, but only about 10 per cent of them cross provincial boundaries or the U.S. border and become federally regulated by the NEB.Under current legislation, NEB-regulated pipelines with a capacity to transport at least 250, 000 barrels of oil per day have an absolute liability of $1 NAME REMOVEDion. All other NEB-regulated pipelines will have absolute liability amounts set by regulations which are currently under development by Natural Resources Canada.

The pipeline groupings have more to do with the size of the systems that are federally regulated.

As such, the NEB is seeking information from interested companies that have the capacity, capability and availability to support the NEB’s response to pipeline incidents on a regional, provincial or national basis should a designated company be unable or unwilling to respond.”","In the event of a pipeline release, the new Pipeline Safety Act (which came into effect on June 19) contains an authority for the Federal Government to “designate” a company if it does not have (or is not likely to have) the financial resources necessary to pay the costs, expenses and damages related to a release. It can also designate a company if it does not comply with a Board order related to that release. Upon designation, the NEB can take any action or measures it considers necessary in relation to the release or authorize a third party to do so. 
The purpose of this  RFI (Request for Information) is to gather information with the goal of preparing a formal competitive procurement process for additional emergency response services. In the unlikely event that the NEB should have to assume control of an emergency response, these services could be called upon to assist our response efforts. To date, the NEB has not had to assume control of an emergency response.

This includes costs incurred from the pre-application engagement, the gathering of Oral Traditional Evidence in 2015 and this year’s hearing expenses, including some of the fees resulting from cancelled Panel Sessions. Some of the costs from New Brunswick and Montreal may not be included if we have not yet received invoices for certain services. This number does not include staff salaries.
 
The recused Panel Members are still National Energy Board Members and are engaged on other files before the Board. You can see the range of salaries on the Government of Canada website: http://appointments.gc.ca/prflOrg.asp?OrgID=NEB&type-typ=1&lang=eng
 
Given the high demand for funding for this hearing, our funding envelope for Participant Funding for the Energy East and Eastern Mainline hearing was increased twice. We were originally allotted $2.5 million from Treasury Board, which was increased to $5 million and then doubled to $10 million. The program reimburses costs after they are incurred. So if an intervenor who has been approved for Participant Funding files a claim for costs associated with preparing evidence for example, they could still request reimbursement for those costs, even though the hearing has been put on hold.

One of the duties of our Chair is to delegate Hearing Panels.

As you may be aware, the Government of Canada has introduced Principles for Pipeline Reviews which are not part of the NEB’s review process.The Minister of Natural Resources has also been mandated by the Prime Minister to modernize the National Energy Board and to ensure its composition reflects regional views and has sufficient expertise in such fields as environmental science, community development, and Indigenous traditional knowledge. That particular initiative is led by the Government of Canada, however, according to this webpage (https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/conservation/assessments/environmental-reviews/national-energy-board-modernization.html?_ga=1.250399750.128058722.1459274265) “The Expert Panel is expected to provide a report with recommendations to the Minister of Natural Resources by January 31, 2017, which will be made public.”
 
Under the Official Languages Act, a company or hearing participant have the right to communicate with the NEB, in writing or orally, in the official language of their choice. TransCanada is not required by law to submit both a French and an English application. As for why the application appears in French on their website only, I think TransCanada would be in the best position to answer that question.

2) There is a suggestion that the two review panels the government has set up – into environmental assessments and modernizing the NEB – might conclude that some responsibility for assessments might be taken away from the NEB. Have you heard any suggestions to that effect? Would you welcome a return to the regime that existed before the CEAA Act of 2012 came into force?
","while there are some differences, they apply the same principles and the same amount of rigour.

One of the differences is around what triggers an environmental assessment. The NEB conducts an Environmental Assessment for all NEB Act applications, including those that do not trigger CEAA, to enable the NEB to consider the environmental implications of a project when making decisions and recommendations in the public interest. For example, Line 9B was not a CEAA 2012 designated project but it underwent an environmental assessment under the NEB Act.

","MEDIA LINES (APPROVED OCT. 11, 2016)
Key Message(s):
•         The NEB is directly responsible for the safe and secure conduct of its own activities, and has a regulatory oversight role with respect to the safety and security of pipeline and energy infrastructure (related to its mandate).
NEB Security Provisions for NEB Operations/Sponsored Activities and Events:
•         The NEB takes action to ensure activities are conducted safely.  Risk assessment and mitigation planning are undertaken for all NEB activities, and vary based on the activity.  The NEB works with local law enforcement organizations to ensure activities are conducted safely.
•         The NEB has a robust policy and guidelines in place for Hearing Security, as well as its own Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) and Security (including physical and information security) provisions. 
NEB Regulatory Requirements for Security:
•         The NEB's Security Program is one of several ways the NEB takes action to protect the safety of the public and the environment. This program verifies regulated companies have adequate security to deter, detect, respond and manage security threats, including criminal and terrorist activity.
 
NEB Oversight 
•         Through its Security Program, the NEB verifies that its regulated companies have an adequate, implemented and effective security program meeting NEB requirements and expectations. It also promotes security awareness, communication, and information sharing among regulated companies.
•         Operations staff conduct various compliance activities including, inspections, compliance screenings and implementation assessments.  Specific to Enbridge facilities in Ontario and Quebec, in each of the past three compliance years, NEB security staff have inspected facilities between Sarnia and Montreal.  NEB staff have been in regular contact with the Enbridge security personnel and receive regular updates on the broad countermeasures implemented to protect the safety and security of the pipeline, the public and the environment in response to these incidents.  NEB staff are of the view that the countermeasures are consistent with Enbridge’s obligations under the OPR. 
•         The NEB pursues cooperation, partnerships and working agreements with federal, provincial, territorial and international departments and agencies.  The includes working closely with the NRCan Energy and Utility Sector Network as established under the Public Safety  National Strategy and Action Plan for Critical Infrastructure.  
Law Enforcement
•         Security incidents may involve local law enforcement agencies, depending on the nature of the incident.   In the case of the incidents referenced above, local law enforcement agencies are involved and have initiated criminal investigations and, where appropriate, laid criminal charges.  
•         NEB staff maintain regular contact with the police and other agencies from across Canada to monitor security incidents and threats to pipelines to protect the safety of the public and the environment.  A key component of a security program is the ability to share and receive timely information on security threats.  Board staff have worked to promote information sharing between all stakeholders.
Application of NEB Administrative Monetary Penalties (AMP)
•         Enforcement options in regards to the individuals involved in this type of activity have been reviewed by various groups within the Board and all groups have concluded that the Board does not have the authority to issue an AMP in relation to these incidents. The elements of a s. 112 violation (that pertain to “a person”) are not met as these incidents do not involve crossing over a pipeline with a vehicle or motor equipment).

Can the NEB provide an update on its assessment of the Trans-Northern pipeline and does it plan to respond or impose any sanctions on the three women who have chained them to a section of the pipeline infrastructure near Oka, Quebec this morning?

Does the NEB share the concerns raised by the women that the pipeline is at risk of contaminating drinking water for millions of people in the Montreal region?
","The NEB does not have legislated authority to issue sanctions against individuals for the type of activity that occurred on the TNPI pipeline on Friday, November 18.   
Regarding the TNPI pipeline, the Amending Safety Order issued on September 27th will uphold safety and environmental protection to improve pipeline safety.
Should the company fail to meet all requirements of the Safety Order, we will take additional enforcement action that may include suspension of their authority to operate the pipeline.
Since the NEB issued Safety Orders in 2009 and 2010, there have been no releases of product on the TNPI pipeline.

","The National Energy Board has been informed that Enbridge has identified an inconsistent reading from one of the measurement tools used to monitor the slope surrounding a section of its Line 21 Pipeline. Out of an abundance of caution, the company has proactively shut down the line while they investigate. While carrying out routine monitoring of the pipeline where it crosses the Mackenzie River, Enbridge staff noted that the south slope could possibly exceed tolerances for safe operation during the spring melt. 

There is no threat to the safety of either the public or the environment. 

The NEB requires operators in Canada to regularly inspect their pipelines to identify anomalies, such as signs of slope instability, well before they become an issue. We expect the companies we regulate to identify potential concerns before they become a problem.

Also, both pipeline companies say their detection methods can only be relied on to detect leaks of three per cent of volume or higher, even though there are technologies that would allow for much more fine detection – has the NEB considered requiring more accurate leak detection systems? Again, if so, where do those stand, and if not, why not?

And finally I’ve been told the NEB has been more accurately tracking how leaks are detected since 2015 – could you explain what prompted the increased monitoring.

In 2016, there was one liquid release (which was produced-water, not oil) that migrated off company property. In total, there were nine liquid releases from NEB-regulated pipelines/facilities in 2016. Five of those were crude oil or refined product (all contained to the site). The others were produced-water (3 of 4 which were contained to the site.)
The NEB requires the company to respond to incidents and take appropriate actions to protect safety of the public and their employees, control the source of the incident and minimize impacts to the environment or property. If it does not believe the company is taking the appropriate actions, the NEB can take over control of the incident response. All incidents are taken very seriously. Companies are required to investigate incidents and implement corrective and preventative actions.

The map for the Eastern Arctic shows one Significant Discovery Licence (SDL) held by Husky Oil.   All SDLs have an indefinite term.  The other leases are held by Repsol.   My understanding is that these Repsol leases are legacy instruments issued prior to the coming-in force of the current Canada Petroleum Resources Act.  The Repsol leases are valid, but are not active.  The leases may be converted to modern instruments, Exploration Licences, only if both INAC and Repsol agree.  If you have more questions on these leases, you may wish to contact INAC directly.

"5410","argus media","2016-05-23","Fort McMurray Wildfire","1. What is the impact of wildfires in Fort McMurray, Alberta on Canadian NGL production? – What was NGL production in January-April 2016 vs January-April 2015?

o The expected impact of the wildfires on NGL production in Alberta is expected to be small and temporary. The majority of Alberta’s NGL production comes from natural gas processing and not from the oil sands. While there were some reductions in natural gas receipts in Alberta during the first half of May, gas production is expected to return to normal as soon as oil sands operations return to meet gas demands in the oil sands.
o Any impacts to NGL production would be limited to off-gas production of ethane, propane, and butanes from oil sands facilities – however, off-gas production accounts for a relatively small proportion of total NGL production in Alberta. Shell’s Scotford upgrader was restarted last week, restoring part of the off-gas production that was lost due to the wildfires.
o The majority of Alberta’s natural gas production and NGL processing facilities are located far away from the Fort McMurray wildfires. 
o Alberta NGL production is only available up to February 2016. By February 2016, C2 production totaled 2,376 thousand m3 (2,198 thousand m3 in 2015) was C3 production was 1,641 thousand m3 (1,438 thousand m3 in 2015); C4 was 909 thousand m3 (849 thousand m3 in 2015).

2. Does the situation in Fort McMurray impact exports or may have an effect in the upcoming months? – What were the export levels in January-April 2016 vs January-April 2015?

o Given the expected low impact of the wildfires on NGL production in Alberta, we are not expecting any impact on propane or butane exports.
o The latest export data available for Canadian propane exports is to March 2016. Canadian exports for the first three months of 2015 were 21.2 thousand m3/d, while in the same period of 2016 propane exports were 23.3 thousand m3/d – a 9.6 per cent year-over-year increase. 
o The latest export data available for Canadian butanes exports is to March 2016. Canadian exports for the first three months of 2015 were 2.9 thousand m3/d, while in the same period of 2016 butanes exports were 2.8 thousand m3/d – a 3.4 per cent year-over-year decrease.

Ms. May described the experiments as being shoddy and unscientific. In one case, she said water was put into a tank and mixed with salt water on a hot day that allowed the temperatures to rise higher than they would on the Vancouver coast. She also said another experiment consisted of mixing oil and water in a plastic bucket.

She noted that the NEB also agreed to Kinder Morgan’s objections to exclude a Royal Society of Canada report from evidence considered in the hearings.

Based on this and many other factors, Ms. May has said she would soon ask for a judicial review of the NEB’s decision.
Does the NEB believe it has a strong enough case to win such a legal challenge, based on the examples that she provided today?","to Ruling 14 which addressed motions for cross examination by Ms. May and Ms. Allan.

In the Trans Mountain hearing, intervenors had two separate opportunities to ask questions regarding evidence filed. In addition intervenors were able to present their own evidence, and final argument.
In addition to Trans Mountain’s evidence, the Board considered evidence about spills from a variety of intervenors including Ms. May, the City of Vancouver, the City of Burnaby,  Tsawout First Nation, and Tsleil-Waututh Nation.

The Board considered all evidence and arguments, including evidence on spill costs, from Trans Mountain and all intervenors equally when deliberating on its recommendation. For further details regarding the Board’s analysis and views of Project-related increase in shipping activities see Chapter 14 of the report.


Regarding your question about a report from the Royal Society of Canada – I cannot find any reference to this on the hearing record, nor did any hearing participant seek to file such a document. Can you provide further clarification of which report you are referring to?

National Energy Board Safety Advisory – Safety Advisory related to 
Canadian Standards Association – Z662-15 (Standard) Non-Mandatory Annex 
Clause K.5.3.4.3.1 Errata
Can you tell me what the effects of using the incorrect calculation 
could be? How serious of an issue is this?
Does this impact all companies operating pipelines? Or only 
""companies that specialize in the area of fracture mechanics."" (I'm 
taking that quote about companies from the Safety Advisory.)
","You may wish to follow up with Sue Capper at the Canadian Standards Association sue.capper@csagroup.org .

In July 2015 the Canadian Standards Association made changes to CSA Z662 Annex K– a non-mandatory annex that utilized fracture mechanics principles to determine acceptable defect criteria in welding.  The changes to Annex K included the addition of a new equation which calculated the critical flaw size (acceptable imperfections) in welds on large scale pipelines. In late 2015 an error in the equation was identified and an erratum with the correct equation was subsequently issued in March 2016. (you can find more information with the Canadian Standards Association https://community.csagroup.org/login.jspa?referer=%252Findex.jspa) 

As a proactive measure, the NEB alerted its regulated companies to the error in Annex K and issued a Safety Order. No reportable incidents on NEB-regulated pipelines have occurred as a result of the incorrect equation. The public safety risk resulting from this calculation error is considered to be low.","n/a","online","safety and environmental protection"

That said, the NEB is monitoring the situation closely and has offered assistance to Environment & Climate Change Canada, which is coorNAME REMOVEDting the federal response. Canada has more than 760,000 kilometres of pipelines that transport oil and gas, but only about 10 per cent of them cross provincial boundaries or the U.S. border and become federally regulated by the NEB.Under current legislation, NEB-regulated pipelines with a capacity to transport at least 250, 000 barrels of oil per day have an absolute liability of $1 NAME REMOVEDion. All other NEB-regulated pipelines will have absolute liability amounts set by regulations which are currently under development by Natural Resources Canada.

The pipeline groupings have more to do with the size of the systems that are federally regulated.

As such, the NEB is seeking information from interested companies that have the capacity, capability and availability to support the NEB’s response to pipeline incidents on a regional, provincial or national basis should a designated company be unable or unwilling to respond.”","In the event of a pipeline release, the new Pipeline Safety Act (which came into effect on June 19) contains an authority for the Federal Government to “designate” a company if it does not have (or is not likely to have) the financial resources necessary to pay the costs, expenses and damages related to a release. It can also designate a company if it does not comply with a Board order related to that release. Upon designation, the NEB can take any action or measures it considers necessary in relation to the release or authorize a third party to do so. 
The purpose of this  RFI (Request for Information) is to gather information with the goal of preparing a formal competitive procurement process for additional emergency response services. In the unlikely event that the NEB should have to assume control of an emergency response, these services could be called upon to assist our response efforts.

","Hearing Panels are generally composed of three NEB Board Members and they are assigned by the Chair of the Board. According to the Official Languages Act, a Board Member must be able to hear the information and evidence presented to them in either official language without the assistance of an interpreter. Therefore, the new Energy East Hearing Panel must be fully bilingual. 
 
The current composition of the National Energy Board does not allow us to name a new Hearing Panel for the Energy East and Eastern Mainline hearing. I can tell you that there is currently a process underway to appoint new Temporary Board Members. Board Members are appointed by Governor in Council on the advice of the Queen’s Privy Council. (http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/index.asp?lang=eng).  As a result, the NEB is not involved in this process.

This includes costs incurred from the pre-application engagement, the gathering of Oral Traditional Evidence in 2015 and this year’s hearing expenses, including some of the fees resulting from cancelled Panel Sessions. Some of the costs from New Brunswick and Montreal may not be included if we have not yet received invoices for certain services. This number does not include staff salaries.
 
The recused Panel Members are still National Energy Board Members and are engaged on other files before the Board. You can see the range of salaries on the Government of Canada website: http://appointments.gc.ca/prflOrg.asp?OrgID=NEB&type-typ=1&lang=eng
 
Given the high demand for funding for this hearing, our funding envelope for Participant Funding for the Energy East and Eastern Mainline hearing was increased twice. We were originally allotted $2.5 million from Treasury Board, which was increased to $5 million and then doubled to $10 million. The program reimburses costs after they are incurred. So if an intervenor who has been approved for Participant Funding files a claim for costs associated with preparing evidence for example, they could still request reimbursement for those costs, even though the hearing has been put on hold.

One of the duties of our Chair is to delegate Hearing Panels. However, as both the Chair and Vice-Chair have recused themselves from certain administrative duties related to the Energy East and Eastern Mainline Hearing, an Acting Board Chair will need to be appointed to carry out this function. The NEB Act includes provisions for an Acting Chair to be named if the Chair or Vice-chair is unable to perform their duties.
 
You are correct, we do not have a timeline for when the new Board Members will be appointed.

As you may be aware, the Government of Canada has introduced Principles for Pipeline Reviews which are not part of the NEB’s review process.The Minister of Natural Resources has also been mandated by the Prime Minister to modernize the National Energy Board and to ensure its composition reflects regional views and has sufficient expertise in such fields as environmental science, community development, and Indigenous traditional knowledge. That particular initiative is led by the Government of Canada, however, according to this webpage (https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/conservation/assessments/environmental-reviews/national-energy-board-modernization.html?_ga=1.250399750.128058722.1459274265) “The Expert Panel is expected to provide a report with recommendations to the Minister of Natural Resources by January 31, 2017, which will be made public.”

2) There is a suggestion that the two review panels the government has set up – into environmental assessments and modernizing the NEB – might conclude that some responsibility for assessments might be taken away from the NEB. Have you heard any suggestions to that effect? Would you welcome a return to the regime that existed before the CEAA Act of 2012 came into force?
","while there are some differences, they apply the same principles and the same amount of rigour.

One of the differences is around what triggers an environmental assessment. The NEB conducts an Environmental Assessment for all NEB Act applications, including those that do not trigger CEAA, to enable the NEB to consider the environmental implications of a project when making decisions and recommendations in the public interest. For example, Line 9B was not a CEAA 2012 designated project but it underwent an environmental assessment under the NEB Act.

"5685","canadian press","2016-11-07","I’m working on a feature article about how Canadian companies are beefing up security in the wake of activist interference with pipelines and reports of rising theft and mischief incidents in the Alberta oilpatch.
I would like to interview someone at the NEB about security requirements for pipelines regulated by the NEB.
","MEDIA LINES (APPROVED OCT. 11, 2016)
Key Message(s):
•         The NEB is directly responsible for the safe and secure conduct of its own activities, and has a regulatory oversight role with respect to the safety and security of pipeline and energy infrastructure (related to its mandate).
NEB Security Provisions for NEB Operations/Sponsored Activities and Events:
•         The NEB takes action to ensure activities are conducted safely.  Risk assessment and mitigation planning are undertaken for all NEB activities, and vary based on the activity.  The NEB works with local law enforcement organizations to ensure activities are conducted safely.
•         The NEB has a robust policy and guidelines in place for Hearing Security, as well as its own Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) and Security (including physical and information security) provisions. 
NEB Regulatory Requirements for Security:
•         The NEB's Security Program is one of several ways the NEB takes action to protect the safety of the public and the environment. This program verifies regulated companies have adequate security to deter, detect, respond and manage security threats, including criminal and terrorist activity.
 
NEB Oversight 
•         Through its Security Program, the NEB verifies that its regulated companies have an adequate, implemented and effective security program meeting NEB requirements and expectations. It also promotes security awareness, communication, and information sharing among regulated companies.
•         Operations staff conduct various compliance activities including, inspections, compliance screenings and implementation assessments.  Specific to Enbridge facilities in Ontario and Quebec, in each of the past three compliance years, NEB security staff have inspected facilities between Sarnia and Montreal.  NEB staff have been in regular contact with the Enbridge security personnel and receive regular updates on the broad countermeasures implemented to protect the safety and security of the pipeline, the public and the environment in response to these incidents.  NEB staff are of the view that the countermeasures are consistent with Enbridge’s obligations under the OPR. 
•         The NEB pursues cooperation, partnerships and working agreements with federal, provincial, territorial and international departments and agencies.  The includes working closely with the NRCan Energy and Utility Sector Network as established under the Public Safety  National Strategy and Action Plan for Critical Infrastructure.  
Law Enforcement
•         Security incidents may involve local law enforcement agencies, depending on the nature of the incident.   In the case of the incidents referenced above, local law enforcement agencies are involved and have initiated criminal investigations and, where appropriate, laid criminal charges.  
•         NEB staff maintain regular contact with the police and other agencies from across Canada to monitor security incidents and threats to pipelines to protect the safety of the public and the environment.  A key component of a security program is the ability to share and receive timely information on security threats.  Board staff have worked to promote information sharing between all stakeholders.
Application of NEB Administrative Monetary Penalties (AMP)
•         Enforcement options in regards to the individuals involved in this type of activity have been reviewed by various groups within the Board and all groups have concluded that the Board does not have the authority to issue an AMP in relation to these incidents. The elements of a s. 112 violation (that pertain to “a person”) are not met as these incidents do not involve crossing over a pipeline with a vehicle or motor equipment).

Can the NEB provide an update on its assessment of the Trans-Northern pipeline and does it plan to respond or impose any sanctions on the three women who have chained them to a section of the pipeline infrastructure near Oka, Quebec this morning?

Does the NEB share the concerns raised by the women that the pipeline is at risk of contaminating drinking water for millions of people in the Montreal region?
","The NEB does not have legislated authority to issue sanctions against individuals for the type of activity that occurred on the TNPI pipeline on Friday, November 18.   
Regarding the TNPI pipeline, the Amending Safety Order issued on September 27th will uphold safety and environmental protection to improve pipeline safety.
Should the company fail to meet all requirements of the Safety Order, we will take additional enforcement action that may include suspension of their authority to operate the pipeline.
Since the NEB issued Safety Orders in 2009 and 2010, there have been no releases of product on the TNPI pipeline.

","Mr. Hamilton was appointed as the Acting Chair of the Board for the sole purpose of making certain executive decisions related to the NEB’s review of the Energy East and Eastern Mainline projects. For example, part of Mr. Hamilton’s role will be to assign a Hearing Panel, and to ensure that the NEB’s review meets the 21-month legislated time limits for the review of the Energy East and Eastern Mainline applications. Mr. Hamilton will be the Acting Chair only for decisions related to the Energy East and Eastern Mainline projects. Peter Watson remains the Chair and CEO of the NEB.
To be clear, Mr. Hamilton will not be part of the three-member Hearing Panel assigned to review the Energy East project. The Hearing Panel has not yet been named. We are expecting three Temporary Board Members to be appointed by the Government of Canada and that has not yet happened.

","The National Energy Board has been informed that Enbridge has identified an inconsistent reading from one of the measurement tools used to monitor the slope surrounding a section of its Line 21 Pipeline. Out of an abundance of caution, the company has proactively shut down the line while they investigate. While carrying out routine monitoring of the pipeline where it crosses the Mackenzie River, Enbridge staff noted that the south slope could possibly exceed tolerances for safe operation during the spring melt. 

There is no threat to the safety of either the public or the environment. 

The NEB requires operators in Canada to regularly inspect their pipelines to identify anomalies, such as signs of slope instability, well before they become an issue. We expect the companies we regulate to identify potential concerns before they become a problem.

-how many pipeline projects were ever rejected by the NEB?
","Every pipeline project the NEB reviews undergoes a rigorous, science-based testing that is among the highest - if not the highest - standard for assessment in the world. And in fact, the NEB does not approve any project application as it is submitted. The Board attaches conditions to any recommendation for approval. Conditions are legal requirements that are designed to make a project even safer.
 
The NEB has denied pipeline applications in the past, although admittedly not very frequently. There are also a number of project applications that do not make it to hearing, that are withdrawn or that are approved and never built.

Some examples of pipeline applications that were denied include:
•         Westcoast Transmission CO Ltd (GH-2-78)
•         TransCanada PipeLines Limited (GH-4-90)
•         TransCanada PipeLines Limited (GH-1-91)

","Typically, facilities are designed with secondary containment appropriate to the type and volume of products handled, so in the majority of cases, released product is restricted from reaching environmentally sensitive receptors and is relatively easily‎ recovered. On the other hand, if released product does make it into the soil and or groundwater, it may be challenging to access to remediate if pipeline facility infrastructure is in the way. However, as the facility is under company care and control,‎ it may be easier to monitor and risk manage residual contamination and/or move or work around the existing infrastructure if immediate remediation is warranted.","n/a","print/online","safety and environmental protection"

The majority of liquid releases also occur at above-ground facilities and do not impact off-company property (note that the NEB does not consider the right-of-way to be company property). In 2016, there was one liquid release (which was produced-water, not oil) that migrated off company property.

More importantly what kind of information is it the NEB is looking for and how many meetings have been scheduled so far, in Sask and across Canada. 
","We recently launched an engagement initiative to get the public’s views and ideas on what the Energy East and Eastern Mainline hearing should look like. As part of this expanded engagement, we are contacting more than 200 Indigenous groups across the country to see if they would like to meet with one of our independent Board Members. One of the key aspects of the discussions will be to identify the best ways to collect oral traditional evidence, which is an important part of the evidence we collect during a hearing.

We have reached out to 42 Indigenous groups in Saskatchewan. If you are interested, a copy of the initial letter we sent to these groups is available on our website: https://apps.neb-one.gc.ca/REGDOCS/Item/View/3265055

Our team is in the process of following up by telephone with each of these groups, all of whom have been identified as being potentially affected by the project. A number of communities have expressed interest in meeting with our Board Members and continuing to engage with our staff on the development of the Energy East and Eastern Mainline Hearing Process. This initiative is about building relationships and listening to what Indigenous communities have to tell us. We expect this process to continue throughout the summer.

In terms of numbers, as we are still in the early stages of this initiative, we haven’t had a lot of meetings to date. We have held one in Quebec and are looking forward to holding more in Saskatchewan and across the country when it is convenient for Indigenous communities to meet with us.

","Could you please explain what decisions had been taken during that two year period, and why a new panel was appointed?

On September 9, 2016, the three NEB panel members previously assigned to the Energy East hearing recused themselves in response to motions alleging that a reasonable apprehension of bias existed. Hearing Participants have also asked that the Board void all previous decisions of the Energy East hearing, given that a reasonable apprehension of bias had been established. You can read more about this decision in our news release from September 2016. The NEB appointed a new hearing panel in January, 2017.

The decision affected by the recusal of the first hearing panel included the finding that the project applications were complete (which started the clock on the 21-month hearing time limit), the list of hearing participants, the list of issues to be considered at the hearing and the Hearing Order.


2) NEB decision last month to consider the Energy East's contribution to upstream and downstream greenhouse gas emissions:  Could you please explain this decision, why it was taken, and for what purpose?

As part of our application review process, it is up to the Hearing Panel to determine which topics are in scope for the hearing. For every NEB hearing, the Hearing Panel will release a List of Issues. All questions, evidence and input provided during the hearing must relate to the List of Issues. 

On August 23, the Hearing Panel for the Energy East and Eastern Mainline hearings issued their final List of Issues for the projects after gathering comments and input from Canadians. Typically, the Board considers direct GHG emissions that result from the construction and operation associated with the pipeline itself. However, for the Energy East and Eastern Mainline projects, the Board said: 
“Given increasing public interest in GHG emissions, together with increasing governmental actions and commitments (including the federal government’s stated interest in assessing upstream GHG emissions associated with major pipelines), the Board is of the view that it should also consider indirect GHG emissions in its NEB Act public interest determination for each of the Projects.” 

You can read the Board’s full decision on the List of Issues to be included in the hearing on our website.


3) Could you explain what happens during a 30-day suspension, and how many times the company can seek a 30-day suspension before having to submit a new application for the NEBs consideration?

I really can’t speculate on what might happen during a 30-day suspension. This is still a decision before the Hearing Panel.

The NEB operates much like a court of law. A hearing participant may file a motion at any time, asking the Hearing Panel to take a particular course of action.

"5960","aptn","2017-07-26","Any comments on the Supreme Court decision today? In hindsight, and considering this ruling, what did the NEB do differently in Clyde River in terms of consultations compared to the Line 9 project with the Chippewas of the Thames? ","Media Lines; One of the key differences in the two projects is the legislation. The Line 9B hearing fell under the NEB Act, which gives us the ability to hold a hearing and provide participant funding to assist groups with the costs associated with participating in a hearing. 

The application for a geophysical operations authorization to carry out seismic work in Baffin Bay fell under the Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act (COGOA). When we reviewed this application in 2013 – 2014, COGOA did not authorize the Board to hold a hearing and we were not able to provide participant funding. These powers were granted in legislative changes to the Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act that took place in 2015.

As I mentioned before, we will review these rulings very carefully to see what improvements we can make to our hearing processes moving forward.

I am hoping to discuss some technical language Part 2: Can you also define ""rundown pot""? Is it the catch basin, essentially, for the condenser, as the gas / vapours cool / condense? The full phrase is ""2B condenser rundown pot.""
","Part 1: 
I've spoken with the engineering team. In answer to your questions: A gas processing plant converts raw natural gas produced from a gas well/field into transmission pipeline quality gas that can then be utilized by end users. Raw gas is transported to the plant via a gathering pipeline from the gas production well. The processing plant removes impurities: water, hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide and other hydrocarbon components to ensure the final product, called sales gas, meets the transmission pipeline quality gas specifications. A condenser is a piece of equipment used to cool and condense gas and vapours during processing. Gas processing involves varying temperature ranges, requiring the fluids that form the process to be heated and cooled as part of these operations. The term “2B” is local terminology used by a facility to identify a specific condenser.                                Part 2: The term “run-down” is used to describe the flow of liquid sulphur (that has been formed via the cooling of vaporous sulphur in the condenser) to a temporary storage area such as a pit. A condenser run down pot is a device used to prevent any entrained hydrogen sulphide and sulphur dioxide vapor in the condensed liquid sulphur that flows from the condenser to the pit from escaping with the liquid sulphur.

Effective 1 April 2017, we have partnered with ClearView Connects, a confidential reporting service that will accept anonymous disclosures on the NEB's behalf. Last year the NEB began refining its internal processes for the receipt and assessment of confidential disclosures as a result of an increased volume of reports over the past two years. The goal was to have a new online reporting tool and mechanism for confidential communication with tipsters.
The cost for ClearView is $27,000 for one year, then an option for years two and three for $24,000. The NEB has been reviewing its existing whistleblower procedures over the last year to ensure it is handling these types of disclosures and discussions in the best possible way. Working with ClearView has a number of benefits including accepting reports 24/7 in the official language of your choice, either electronically or with a live operator. All information reported will be collected, stored, secured, and managed by them – meaning all confidential disclosures will be isolated from other NEB databases.

The note is titled, “Valvitalia fittings/Fittings not meeting specified material strength,” dated Oct. 11, 2016. 
 
The note says TransCanada informed the NEB in 2016 it has been using substandard pipeline fittings from the Italian company Valvitalia since 2011. That was the fourth case for TransCanada since 2011, according to the note. 
 
The note also says NEB will be monitoring the company’s investigation and remediation plans, and that staff recommend an amendment to a safety advisory on pipelines from February 2016 and recommends taking broader action, including a possible inquiry.  
 
I’m wondering if the NEB can elaborate on what was the result of the company’s investigation and what TransCanada’s remediation plans were, and how they are or were both coming along.  
 
Were there any penalties for TransCanada?
 
As well, is the below press release a direct result of the Valvitalia case? The announcement in it seems to be what NEB staff were talking about in the briefing note — the amendment to the safety advisory and the draft order on pipeline materials.

This will continue through the weekend and beyond.
Fire safety is a key consideration in the design and operational phases of any NEB-regulated pipeline.
The NEB requires fire monitoring and suppression systems with secondary power sources; incorporation of non-flammable materials in the design of facilities, vegetation management and fire-specific emergency response and contingency plans.
In addition to monitoring regulated companies, NEB personnel are working with provincial and federal agencies to identify potential or existing threats to the safety of cross-border pipelines and associated facilities.
•         These agencies include:  the British Columbia Oil and Gas Commission (BCOGC), British Columbia Provincial Emergency Management Organization BC PEMO, and the Federal Government Operations Centre.

2-Does one have a record or specific information (number, locations, etc.) regarding the presence of these structures on pipelines in operation in Canada?
","1-are such structures (weights) used for pipelines in operation in Canada? 

Buoyancy control weights (swamp weights or river weights) or equivalent measures are required where buried pipe could become buoyant and float towards the surface. The use of such measures is prescribed in Canadian Standards Association Z662-15 (See Clause 4.12.2.1).

Weights are used on pipelines in Canada. Companies under our jurisdiction are required to regularly inspect the entire length of their pipelines including where weights are located.

As with other pipeline incidents in the United States, we will review the final report of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to identify whether lessons learned can be applied here in Canada to strengthen our oversight of regulated infrastructure.

2-Does one have a record or specific information (number, locations, etc.) regarding the presence of these structures on pipelines in operation in Canada?

Regulated companies position and manage the required number and location of buoyancy control weights on a site-specific basis. Companies are not required to present the precise details of weights, however this information can be requested by the NEB if at any time it is required.

The NEB regulates the capacity of major interprovincial pipelines and exports.  The operating capacity of a liquid pipeline is a function of its design capacity, which is dictated by different engineering considerations such as material selection and pipeline design. It is also determined by factors such pressure and flow rate restrictions to comply with safety margin requirements, and the level of integrity of the pipeline.

He has expressed concerns about what would happen to a property owner that disagrees with the route or is facing major losses as a result of having the company use their property for new segments of the pipeline in Burnaby.

Would you be able to tell me what will the NEB do to accommodate landowners who feel the compensation is not adequate? Or would the NEB consider route changes to accommodate a landowner that doesn’t want the pipeline going through their property?

Mr. Stewart also gave the example of a condo developer that just learned their new project was going to be on the pipeline route after making investments and developing a business plan. He said this condo developer feels its project is now in financial jeopardy because of the pipeline route.
In this case, should the company or the NEB have provided more information about the route during the public hearings and in the review of the TMX project to ensure that the public was adequately consulted?

Mr. Stewart said that some property owners may face rising insurance rates if they are located on or near the pipeline right-of-way.

Is the route the best possible?
Are the methods and timing of construction appropriate?
Why is it only these two questions that are considered?
Best possible and appropriate for whom? Canadians? The NEB? Trans Mountain?

I understand that the NEB doesn't have a role to play in determining compensation from a company. But what happens when the NEB approves a route against the wishes of the owner. Is the pipeline company free from having to compensate the owners of the land?
Where would I learn more about this?
","At the moment, we anticipate the detailed route hearings for Trans Mountain will be held in Valemount and Clearwater in February-March of 2018. We will provide more details when we get closer to the hearing dates. You are correct, landowners and affected persons may file an opposition to the detailed route of a pipeline based on the location of the pipeline or the methods of timing or construction. This is set out in our guiding legislation, the National Energy Board Act. 

During the hearing, we examined a range of issues related to the project. Now that the project has been approved, the Act is clear that the Board may only consider those issues related to determining the best possible route.

In terms of how we define the best possible route, the Board will take a site specific approach, consider all the evidence that is placed on the hearing record and reach a decision that balances the needs of all parties in the detailed route hearing.

Regardless of the outcome of a detailed route hearing, the pipeline company is still required to compensate the landowner. You can find this in section 86 of the NEB Act.

I’m wondering if you can provide more information about whether there have been previous cases where the NEB released a decision of this nature, following a formal hearing, without providing reasons for its ruling.

Whether it has happened or not, can you provide any comments about why the NEB opted to do this in this particular case?

Would it give parties extra time to appeal if they wish to do so?
","At this point, we don’t have a sense of when the reasons will be release, but I will send them your way when they are available. The reasons have not been shared with intervenors and the parties. There is no further update on when the reasons behind the decision will be available, but as promised I will send the reasons to you when they are available. Here is what the NEB Act says about appeals: NEB Act (s. 22(1.1)) states:  “An application for leave to appeal must be made within thirty days after the release of the decision or order sought to be appealed from or within such further time as a judge of [the Federal Court of Appeal] under special circumstances allows.”  Not unusual to release decision without reasons.
 
Because the reasons for the decision have not yet been released, I cannot elaborate on the ruling. The ruling says that Trans Mountain is not required to comply with one section of the City of Burnaby’s Zoning Bylaw and one section of the City of Burnaby’s Tree Bylaw, at three particular sites. I would add that this is not a broad exemption from all City of Burnaby bylaws. The company is still required to comply with all other applicable bylaws, not just in Burnaby but along the route.

When the Government of Canada approved the Trans Mountain Expansion Project in 2016, it approved a pipeline corridor which averages about 150 metres wide. The hearings we are holding in Burnaby this week are to consider the exact placement of the pipeline in the approved corridor. Anyone who felt that their lands could be adversely affected by the proposed route of the pipeline were able to file a statement of opposition. An affected person could oppose the location of the pipeline, the methods of construction or the timing of construction. The Board reviewed these statements of opposition and then decided who should be granted a hearing, based on the criteria for a detailed route hearing in the National Energy Board Act. We issued a news release last fall that may be helpful: https://www.canada.ca/en/national-energy-board/news/2017/10/trans_mountain_expansiondetailedroutehearingsforburnabysegmentbe.html
 
The hearing participants were required to submit their statements of opposition months ago, so only those who have applied and been granted a hearing will be participating in these hearings.

Is this a change in the route of the pipeline expansion or a response to any of the concerns being raised about the proposed route for the pipeline?","Trans Mountain applied to the NEB in March 2017 to vary the Certificates which granted them the authority to build and operate the Trans Mountain Expansion Project. Companies may apply under section 21 of the NEB Act to change the pipeline corridor, the beginning or end point of the project, etc.  In this case, the company requested a variance which would allow them to: 
• maintain Edmonton Terminal Tank No. 9 in operational service; 
• maintain Niton Pump Station in a deactivated state; and 
• maintain Wolf Pump Station in operational service. 
The Board recommended in July, 2017 that this application be approved: A85032-1 NEB Letter - Trans Mountain - Trans Mountain Expansion - Variance - Certificates OC-2 and OC-49 and Order XO-T260-010-2016 - A5S3U7
When the Board recommends that a variance application be approved, it does not become effective until the variance is approved by GiC. The orders in council that you saw relate to activities at Trans Mountain’s Edmonton Terminal and at two pump stations.

As you are no doubt aware, there have been escalating protests in recent weeks against the pipeline project.
A senior representative of the City of Burnaby suggested, during an interview earlier this afternoon,  that the NEB has asserted authority in the lands, in Burnaby,  where the project is being developed so might have a notable role as a partner with the RCMP in managing the response to protests.
Can you elaborate on or clarify this assertion by day’s end tomorrow?
Any details you could provide would be greatly appreciated.
","Safety and protection of the environment are always the National Energy Board’s top priorities for projects under our jurisdiction. In that light, we require all NEB-regulated companies to maintain a safe and secure work site, in addition to meeting requirements set out in provincial and federal legislation, such as the Canada Labour Code.
 
With regard to public protest activity, we will continue to monitor Trans Mountain’s actions to maintain a safe and secure working environment. However, the NEB does not play a role in the oversight of police and law enforcement actions.  Questions about specific incidents should be directed to the company and/or appropriate law enforcement agencies.
