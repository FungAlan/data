<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently
 in Ontario, Premier Doug Ford summarily scrapped Ontario's cap-andtrade
 program, which would have burdened Ontario companies with costly carbon
 accounting and sent millions of Ontario's dollars to California to buy 
carbon credits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2017, Ontarians paid nearly $2 billion annually as the cost of cap-and-trade was passed onto consumers.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover,
 Ontario will cancel some 758 contracts for renewable power, saving the 
province another $790 million while helping reduce power prices for 
Ontarians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides partying at 
Stampede and doing aerial acrobatics, what has Premier Rachel Notley 
done to increase investment attractiveness in Alberta? Let's review. 
Since coming to office, she raised corporate income taxes to 12% from 
10% - a hike of about 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And discouraged wealthier folks, who might live and invest here, by killing Alberta's highly attractive flat income tax rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Due to this tax hike, 
which went from 10% up to 15% for high earners, Albertans who earn more 
than $300,000 per year saw their taxes rise 50%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP government has 
also stacked a daunting pile of regulatory bricks onto the back of a 
prostrate industry when it was reeling from a massive drop in oil 
prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Canada's energy 
sector was down, they were hit with Premier Notley's "Climate Leadership
 Plan," which expanded and increased Alberta's carbon tax to $30/tonne 
of emissions, and will ostensibly follow the Trudeau government's 
federal plan to raise the tax to $50/tonne by 2022, as her contingent 
condition of getting a pipeline built was satisfied by Ottawa's purchase
 of the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain expansion project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the tax 
hikes, the government put a hard cap on the emissions of greenhouse 
gases from the oilsands, limiting them to 100 megatonnes per year, a 
constraint which could start to bite in the mid-2020s, threatening the 
viability of longterm projects and costing the economy billions in lost 
production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's Climate 
Leadership Plan also includes a commitment to phase out coal-generated 
electricity by 2030, triple renewable energy to supply 30% of generation
 by 2030, further reduce methane emissions from the oil and <b>gas</b> 
sector, and create a new agency to spend Alberta's carbon tax revenues 
on energy-efficiency programs with a very poor record of success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drove up prices</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are the kind of policies that drove up energy prices in Ontario and drove investment and jobs out of the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simply put, as Ontario 
steps back from cap-andtrade and wind and solar power, Alberta forges 
ahead with burdensome regulations, renewable energy subsidies and higher
 taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And all of this after the spectacular failure of Premier Notley's "<b>social license</b>" dream that was never going to be granted by environmentalists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, we now have a 
precedent that, if pipelines are to be built, the government must fund 
them or indemnify them with Alberta's and Canada's tax dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the premier is serious about rebuilding Alberta's oil and <b>gas</b>
 sector, she should get off the Stampede zip-line and start removing the
 bricks she put on the back of Alberta's energy economy, to make Alberta
 a profitable place to invest with a more predictable and affordable

 pundits should not be so quick to write off the new Doug Ford-Scott Moe
 alliance against the federal carbon tax. Yes, they were the only two of
 the 10 premiers in New Brunswick this week to announce their support 
for a constitutional challenge to the federal law. And yes 
constitutional experts are correct in predicting that this legal 
challenge is not likely to succeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But winning in the legal 
battle does not mean winning the policy war. Obstructionist provincial 
governments can gum up federal policies whose effective implementation 
require provincial co-operation. Witness how B.C. Premier Phil Horgan 
and his anti-pipeline allies have succeeded in delaying the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline expansion despite losing 17 consecutive court decisions.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With
 respect to the carbon tax, the law may be on the side of Ottawa, but 
time and politics are not. Saskatchewan's reference to its court of 
appeal won't be decided for another nine months. Whoever loses will 
appeal to the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>, 
which will take another year or more to be heard and then decided. By 
then, there will have been a spring election in Alberta and a federal 
election in the fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Alberta, Conservative 
leader Jason Kenney is promising to scrap that province's carbon tax if 
he wins next year's election. All current polling suggests that he will.
 Manitoba has adopted its own version of a carbon tax, but the price it 
places on CO2 is below the minimum demanded by the federal plan. Premier
 Pallister has warned that if Ottawa tries to force it higher, "we'll 
see you in court." PEI has adopted a climate change plan with no carbon 
tax - a policy that clearly does not meet federal regulations. And if 
anti-tax momentum builds, the Newfoundland and New Brunswick premiers 
have warned that they are not going impose a tax on their voters that 
consumers and businesses in six or seven other provinces are not paying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Jason Kenney speaks to the media at his first convention as leader of 
the United Conservative Party in Red Deer, Alta., Sunday, May 6, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With next year's federal 
election fast approaching, this is potential nightmare scenario for 
Trudeau and the Liberals. Do they want to make the ballot-issue a new 
tax that will make it more expensive for voters to fill up their cars, 
heat their homes and turn on their lights? Maybe this won't make any 
difference in Saskatchewan and Alberta, where the Liberals only have 
five MPs. But in Ontario - where Doug Ford just won by promising to 
scrap the tax - the Liberals have 80 MPs seeking re-election. Losing 
even a quarter of these would jeopardize their 183 seat government, 
which is only 13 over the 170 minimum required for a majority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2015, many 
centre-right voters supported Trudeau simply because they were tired of 
Stephen Harper. But in 2018, they supported Doug Ford because they were 
tired of sky-rocketing electricity and <b>gas</b> prices. If in 2019 
Trudeau takes a hardline on bringing back the very carbon tax that 
Premier Ford has just repealed, he risks losing some of these former 
supporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the alternative - 
backing off on the carbon tax - has its own risks. Promising action on 
climate change was one of the issues that helped Trudeau win in 2015. 
With the help of the U.S.-financed environmental NGO (ENGO) LeadNow, the
 Liberals targeted 29 Conservative-held ridings in which their polling 
indicated that climate change was a priority for voters. Liberal 
candidates subsequently won 25 of these seats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these same 
centre-left voters that supported Trudeau in 2015 are no longer so happy
 with him. Many are angry about the federal government's $4.5 billion 
bailout of the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline 
expansion in B.C. If Trudeau now backs down on his national carbon tax 
pledge, many of his 2015 supporters for whom climate action is still a 
priority may drift off to the NDP in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underlying the Liberals' carbon tax dilemma is the spectacular failure of the Trudeau-Notley "<b>social license</b>"
 gambit: their belief that in return for their various carbon reduction 
policies, climate change ENGOs would acquiesce in Canada's economic need
 to build the Kinder Morgan TransMountain expansion. Whatever 
plausibility this trade-off strategy may have had initially has now been
 destroyed. The anti-Kinder Morgan forces - the Horgan government, U.S. 
and Canadian climate ENGOs and B.C. aboriginal groups - have accelerated
 their opposition to TransMountain, not backed off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor are they shy about 
explaining why. When CBC asked Bill McKibben( 
http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1100225603963[http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1100225603963]
 ), founder of <span class="companylink">350.org</span>, why he would 
not give Trudeau and Notley any credit for Canada's carbon reduction 
policies, he stated a simple fact: that at only two per cent of global 
emissions, what Canada does on the domestic "demand" side to reduce our 
emissions is too small to make any difference. What will make a 
difference, McKibbon continued, is preventing the further development of
 the Canadian oil sands - the third largest reserve on the world. "To 
stop the oil sands, we have to stop all pipelines."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The failure of his <b>social license</b> strategy forced Trudeau to rescue the TransMountain expansion with the $4.5 billion dollar purchase of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada</span>.
 This did not win him many new friends in Alberta or Saskatchewan, but 
infuriated many of his erstwhile climate change supporters in Ontario 
and British Columbia. With an election only a year away, the carbon tax 
issue threatens to push the Liberals even deeper into a political corner
 with no easy way out.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Climate change has the 
potential to destabilize growing and struggling marketplaces, and energy
 operators looking to sell their resources in those markets should be 
mindful that adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere could inhibit 
economic growth, Rachel Kyte, CEO of Sustainable Energy for All, said 
June 28 at the Washington, D.C., event.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"<b>Gas</b>
 will not be a solution for poverty in a world where climate change is 
driving more people into poverty unless you fix your methane problem and
 fix it quick," Kyte said during a keynote address. "My message to you 
is I think there's a very important role for <b>gas</b> in cleaning the 
energy mix, in reaching people who don't have reliable and affordable 
energy today, in helping their economies grow, but let's not leave the 
room with the elephant still in there, untouched."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reducing methane on a 
global scale would be likely to require public-private partnerships, in 
addition to "very strong" regulatory regimes, she said. Her organization
 was founded by former U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The oil and <b>gas</b> industry is "only as good as the lowest common denominator," Richard Ward, global methane program director at the <span class="companylink">Rocky Mountain Institute</span>, told a panel of methane experts June 26 at the same event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some companies have made 
commitments to reduce methane emissions, but the less proactive 
operators may increasingly put the industry as a whole in the crosshairs
 of environmental advocates looking to hold down greenhouse <b>gas</b> emissions, Ward said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Those are your brethren," Ward said. "Those [companies] emit the same molecules to the same sky for the same global warming."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operators should not 
assume the issue of methane emissions will not affect them if they keep a
 low profile, said Jennifer Stewart, Southwestern Energy Co.'s vice 
president of government and regulatory affairs. Stewart, who was on the 
June 26 panel, agreed that there is a need to bring lagging companies 
along when it comes to minimizing methane emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and her colleague Roy
 Hartstein, Southwestern's vice president of strategic solutions, 
indicated that they are "agnostic" about whether regulations are the 
appropriate way to restrict methane emissions from oil and <b>gas</b> 
operations. Hartstein highlighted changing practices among operators in 
recent decades that have already limited the amount of methane that 
companies release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a pair of scientists cautioned against overestimating how much progress the oil and <b>gas</b> sector has made on reducing emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There have been 
assertions that the rate of emissions is going down. I don't know if 
that's true, and I don't know if anyone else knows that that's true," 
Steven Hamburg, chief scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, said 
during a question session after the panel discussion. "There are 
well-documented improvements in some practices. The trouble is ... we 
can document those, we can applaud those, but in the aggregate, we can't
 say, 'If we continue the trend we're on now, we're going to get to 
where we need to be.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atmospheric methane levels have increased but not at the same rate as oil and <b>gas</b>
 operations have expanded in recent decades, said Stefan Schwietzke, a 
research scientist at the University of Colorado and the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Even if all the increase in 
methane emissions has been from the fossil fuel industry, the disparity 
between methane and development growth rates indicates that the oil and <b>gas</b> sector has gotten more efficient at holding in its emissions, Schwietzke said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But all these 
improvements, they have been counteracted by increased production," 
Schwietzke said. "We can increase our efficiency, reduce emissions per 
well ... but if we're doubling the wells, doubling production, we see 
the same methane in the atmosphere."</p>

<span class="companylink">Horizon Petroleum</span> Announces NI51-101 Reserves and -2-</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">History and Development Plan</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lachowice field is at an early stage of conventional natural <b>gas</b>
 development. Lachowice-1, Lachowice-7 and Stryszawa-2K are the primary 
wells of interest on the field and, despite being essentially vertical 
in their design and utilizing sub-optimal drilling and completion 
methods for naturally fractured formations, tested at rates of up to 5.8
 MMcf/d, 8.9 MMcf/d, and 2.5 MMcf/d, respectively. Each of these wells 
was drilled and tested, with reservoir depths of 3,000-4,000 meters 
targeting a naturally fractured carbonate reservoir of Middle Devonian 
age. The natural <b>gas</b> is sweet, with up to 91% methane and 7 bbls/MMcf of condensate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following receipt of the 
Reserves Report, Horizon is currently in the process of finalizing its 
development plan. In general, it is currently anticipated that the 
development plan would begin with a new vertical well offsetting the 
Lachowice-7 location. Provided Horizon successfully closes the 
Acquisition, it is targeting to drill and test the well in the first 
half of 2019, with first production to occur by late 2019, with natural <b>gas</b> sales initially facilities constrained at approximately 3.0 MMcfe/d. The wells will produce natural <b>gas</b>
 under primary drive via the natural fractures and the matrix porosity 
within the reservoir. The project is considered pre-development and is 
expected to cost approximately US$7.5 million to first production. In a 
previous press release dated September 19, 2017, Horizon had stated it 
was targeting first production from the Lachowice field by the second 
half of 2018. The regulatory process has proceeded slower than 
anticipated, and therefore the conversion of the concessions to the new 
Polish concession laws, and approvals related to Horizon taking 
operatorship of the concessions, has taken longer than expected. It is 
Horizon's understanding that the Polish government is currently 
considering these concessions, and the conversion and approvals are 
expected within the next six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new horizontal or 
highly deviated well and a horizontal or highly deviated re-entry of the
 new vertical well (targeting &gt;300m natural <b>gas</b> column) would 
be drilled in mid-2020, increasing production to 17.5 MMcfe/d at a new 
processing facility expected to be operational in late 2020. Drilling 
would continue with production increases to over 30 MMcfe/d thereafter. 
Operating netbacks are expected to be approximately US$6.80 per Mcfe, 
based on current pricing. Timing of the development is subject to 
regulatory approvals, and Horizon has initiated efforts to begin and 
fast-track the regulatory process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other Assets - France</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In France, the government passed a law on December 30, 2017 preventing new oil and natural <b>gas</b>
 licences to be issued, and all production on existing permits to cease 
by 2040. The Company has allowed its Ger licence to expire and has 
applied for a three-year extension on its Ledeuix licence. To the 
Company's knowledge, other companies operating in France have received 
extensions, and as such the Company has no reason to believe that it 
will not receive approval on the extension in 12-18 months. Currently, 
as there is no clarity on timing to first production, the Company will 
initiate the seismic and drilling applications but reduce all 
expenditures in France to minimum levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">C$5 Million Financing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horizon proposes to raise
 up to C$5 million through a private placement, issuing up to 
100,000,000 common shares at a price of $0.05 per share. The net 
proceeds are to be used to close the Acquisition, prepare the assets for
 development and for general corporate purposes. Horizon has entered 
into an engagement agreement with Gneiss Energy Limited, a London, 
United Kingdom based energy-focused advisory practice, for the purposes 
of raising new equity in Europe. In addition, Horizon will raise 
additional funds from Canadian and certain UK investors on a 
non-brokered basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horizon is currently 
examining options for improving the Company's trading liquidity, access 
to new equity capital in Europe and profile alongside its international 
E&amp;P peers. As part of these deliberations, Horizon may consider 
listing on another exchange, such as the <span class="companylink">London Stock Exchange</span>. In the event the Company decides to undertake an additional listing, it expects to execute a plan within the next 6-12 months.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil and <b>Gas</b> Advisories</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reserve and resource 
estimates contained in this press release have been prepared in 
accordance with NI 51-101, is dated as of January 31, 2018 and prepared 
by APEX.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reserve and resource estimates of natural <b>gas</b> and natural <b>gas</b>
 liquids reserves provided in this news release are estimates only, and 
there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves and/or resources will 
be recovered. Actual reserves and resources may eventually prove to be 
greater than, or less than, the estimates provided herein. It should not
 be assumed that the estimates of future net revenues presented herein 
represent the fair market value of the reserves and/or resources. There 
are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of natural <b>gas</b> and natural <b>gas</b> liquids reserves and/or resources and the future cash flows attributed to such reserves and/or resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These risks and 
uncertainties include but are not limited to: (i) the fact that there is
 no certainty that the zones of interest will exist to the extent 
estimated or that the zones will be found to have natural <b>gas</b> 
with characteristics that meet or exceed the minimum criteria in terms 
of net pay thickness and/or porosity, or that the natural <b>gas</b> 
will be commercially recoverable to the extent estimated; (ii) the fact 
that there is no certainty that any portion of the probable reserves and
 contingent and prospective resources will be commercially viable to 
produce; (iii) the fact that the Company must hire an operations team 
and executive team in both Calgary and Poland in order to execute on the
 development plan, and there are no guarantees that suitably qualified 
technical and professional staff and/or consultants will be available; 
(iv) the lack of additional financing to fund the Company's development 
activities and continued operations; (v) the risks associated with 
obtaining approvals to access land to drill wells or install 
infrastructure and facilities in a reasonable time frame; the Polish 
regulatory regime is relatively stable but is marked with long approval 
processes relative to North American jurisdictions; (vi) the risks in 
acquiring or constructing adequate natural <b>gas</b> infrastructure to produce and sell natural <b>gas</b>,
 and whether capacity will be available in the existing main pipeline 
system at reasonable costs; (vii) the risk that there may not be a 
drilling rig available to drill the required wells, and the risk that if
 a rig mobilization is required from outside of Poland, that the costs 
may be prohibitive; (ix) risks inherent in the international oil and 
natural <b>gas</b> industry; (x) fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates; (xi)the number of competitors in the oil and <b>gas</b>
 industry with greater technical, financial and operations resources and
 staff; (xii) fluctuations in world prices and markets for oil and 
natural <b>gas</b> due to domestic, international, political, social, 
economic and environmental factors beyond the Company's control; (xiii) 
changes in government regulations affecting oil and natural <b>gas</b> 
operations; (xiv) potential liabilities for pollution or hazards against
 which the Company cannot adequately insure or which the Company may 
elect not to insure; (xv) contingencies affecting the classification as 
reserves versus resources which relate to the following issues as 
detailed in the COGE Handbook: ownership considerations, drilling 
requirements, testing requirements, regulatory considerations, 
infrastructure and market considerations, timing of production and 
development, and economic requirements; (xvi) the fact that there is no 
certainty that any portion of the prospective resources will be 
discovered and if discovered, there is no certainty that it will be 
commercially viable to produce any portion of the resources; and (xvii) 
other factors beyond the Company's control.</p>

are the Company's working interest (operating or non-operating) share

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resources are defined in the Canadian Oil and <b>Gas</b> Evaluation Handbook (COGEH) Volume 1, section 5 as follows:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources are 
those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from known accumulations, but the applied 
projects are not yet considered mature enough for commercial development
 due to one or more contingencies. Contingent Resources may include, for
 example, projects for which there are currently no viable markets, or 
where commercial recovery is dependent on technology under development, 
or where evaluation of the accumulation is insufficient to clearly 
assess commerciality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingencies may include
 factors such as economic, legal, environmental, political, and 
regulatory matters, or a lack of markets. It is also appropriate to 
classify as contingent resources, the estimated discovered recoverable 
quantities associated with a project in the early evaluation stage. 
Contingent Resources are further classified in accordance with the level
 of certainty associated with the estimates and may be sub classified 
based on project maturity and/or characterized by their economic status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all technically 
feasible development plans will be commercial. The commercial viability 
of a development project is dependent on the forecast of fiscal 
conditions over the life of the project. For Contingent Resources, the 
risk component relating to the likelihood that an accumulation will be 
commercially developed is referred to as the "chance of development." 
For contingent resources, the chance of commerciality is equal to the 
chance of development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development Pending are 
contingencies that are being actively pursued; expect resolution in a 
reasonable time period; are directly influenced by the developer with 
both, internal approvals and commitment and development timing and; have
 a high chance of development (&gt;80%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development on Hold are 
contingencies with major non-technical contingencies identified; have a 
reasonable chance of development (&gt;50%); have contingencies that are 
beyond the control of the developer including but not limited to: 
external approvals, economic factors, market access, political factors 
and <b>social license</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development Unclarified 
are contingencies that have not been clearly defined; the project is 
currently under active evaluation; significant further appraisal may be 
required; progress is expected in a reasonable time period; chance of 
development is difficult to assess and could be a big range (20%-80%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development Not Viable 
are contingencies that have been identified; the project was evaluated 
and considered not viable or significant further appraisal may be 
required; progress is not expected in a reasonable time period and; has a
 low chance of development (&lt;&lt;50%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources 
--Development Pending and --Development On Hold are considered economic,
 Contingent Resources --Development Unclarified have economics that are 
undetermined, and Contingent Resources --Development Not Viable are 
considered sub-economic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective Resources are
 those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application 
of future development projects. Prospective resources have both an 
associated chance of discovery and a chance of development. Prospective 
Resources are further subdivided in accordance with the level of 
certainty associated with recoverable estimates assuming their discovery
 and development and may be sub classified based on project maturity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all exploration 
projects will result in discoveries. The chance that an exploration 
project will result in the discovery of petroleum is referred to as the 
"chance of discovery." Thus, for an undiscovered accumulation, the 
chance of commerciality is the product of two risk components -- the 
chance of discovery and the chance of development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estimates of resources 
always involve uncertainty, and the degree of uncertainty can vary 
widely between accumulations/projects and over the life of a project. 
Consequently, estimates of resources should generally be quoted as a 
range according to the level of confidence associated with the 
estimates. An understanding of statistical concepts and terminology is 
essential to understanding the confidence associated with resources 
definitions and categories. These concepts, which apply to all 
categories of resources, are outlined below. The range of uncertainty of
 estimated recoverable volumes may be represented by either 
deterministic scenarios or by a probability distribution. Resources 
should be provided as low, best, and high estimates as follows: </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">   -- Low Estimate and/or 1C in the case of Contingent Resources: This is 
      considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity that will 
      actually be recovered. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities 
      recovered will exceed the low estimate. If probabilistic methods are used, 
      there should be at least a 90 percent probability (P90) that the 
      quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the low estimate. 
 
   -- Best Estimate and/or 2C in the case of Contingent Resources: This is 
      considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will actually be 
      recovered. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities 
      recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate. If 
      probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50 percent 
      probability (P50) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or 
      exceed the best estimate. 
 
   -- High Estimate and/or 3C in the case of Contingent Resources: This is 
      considered to be an optimistic estimate of the quantity that will 
      actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual remaining 
      quantities recovered will exceed the high estimate. If probabilistic 
      methods are used, there should be at least a 10 percent probability (P10) 
      that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the high 
      estimate. </pre>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This approach to 
describing uncertainty may be applied to reserves, contingent resources,
 and prospective resources. There may be significant risk that sub 
commercial and undiscovered accumulations will not achieve commercial 
production, however, it is useful to consider and identify the range of 
potentially recoverable quantities independently of such risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main contingencies 
identified in the Lachowice Reserves Report are the successful 
recompletion of existing abandoned wells, the expected decline rates and
 the approval and completion of new development and new re-entries.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This press release 
contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information 
(collectively "forward-looking information") within the meaning of 
applicable securities laws relating to the Company's plans and other 
aspects of our anticipated future operations, management focus, 
strategies, financial, operating and production results, industry 
conditions, commodity prices and business opportunities. In addition, 
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this press release
 contains forward-looking information regarding anticipated netbacks, 
anticipated potential of the Acquisition, the closing and timing of the 
Acquisition, the timing of the remaining regulatory approvals to close 
the Acquisition, the closing and timing of closing of the Financing, the
 use of proceeds from the Financing, decisions regarding additional 
listings, production guidance, capital program and allocation thereof, 
future production, development and drilling plans, well economics, 
future cost reductions, potential growth, the extension of the Ledeuix 
licence and the current operating plans with respect to the Company's 
assets in Franceas well as the source of funding the Company's capital 
spending. Forward-looking information typically uses words such as 
"anticipate", "believe", "project", "expect", "goal", "plan", "intend" 
or similar words suggesting future outcomes, statements that actions, 
events or conditions "may", "would", "could" or "will" be taken or occur
 in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The forward-looking 
information is based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by
 Horizon's management, including expectations and assumptions noted 
previously in this press release under oil and <b>gas</b> advisories, 
and in addition with respect to prevailing commodity prices and 
differentials, exchange rates, interest rates, applicable royalty rates 
and tax laws; future production rates and estimates of operating costs; 
performance of future wells; reserve and resource volumes; anticipated 
timing and results of capital expenditures; the success obtained in 
drilling new wells; the sufficiency of budgeted capital expenditures in 
carrying out planned activities; the timing, location and extent of 
future drilling operations; the state of the economy and the exploration
 and production business; results of operations; performance; business 
prospects and opportunities; the availability and cost of financing, 
labour and services; the impact of increasing competition; the ability 
to efficiently integrate assets and employees acquired through 
acquisitions, including the Acquisition, the ability to market natural <b>gas</b>
 successfully and Horizon's ability to access capital. Although the 
Company believes that the expectations and assumptions on which such 
forward-looking information is based are reasonable, undue reliance 
should not be placed on the forward-looking information because Horizon 
can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct. Since 
forward-looking information addresses future events and conditions, by 
its very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Horizon's
 actual results, performance or achievement could differ materially from
 those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking information and,
 accordingly, no assurance can be given that any of the events 
anticipated by the forward-looking information will transpire or occur, 
or if any of them do so, what benefits that we will derive therefrom. 
Management has included the above summary of assumptions and risks 
related to forward-looking information provided in this press release in
 order to provide securityholders with a more complete perspective on 
future operations and such information may not be appropriate for other 
purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Readers are cautioned 
that the foregoing lists of factors are not exhaustive. These 
forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this press release
 and we disclaim any intent or obligation to update publicly any 
forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, 
future events or results or otherwise, other than as required by 
applicable securities laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This press release 
contains future-oriented financial information and financial outlook 
information (collectively, "FOFI") about Horizon's prospective results 
of operations, operating netbacks and components thereof, all of which 
are subject to the same assumptions, risk factors, limitations and 
qualifications as set forth in the above paragraphs. FOFI contained in 
this press release was made as of the date of this press release and was
 provided for the purpose of providing further information about 
Horizon's anticipated future business operations. Readers are cautioned 
that the FOFI contained in this press release should not be used for 
purposes other than for which it is disclosed herein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Non-GAAP Measures</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This press release 
includes non-GAAP measures as further described herein. These non-GAAP 
measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by International 
Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS" or, alternatively, "GAAP") and 
therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures
 by other companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operating netbacks are 
determined by deducting royalties, net profit interest, production 
expenses and selling expenses from oil and <b>gas</b> revenue. Operating netbacks are per mcfe measures used in operational and capital allocation decisions. </p>

The assumptions used to generate the netback (US$/Mcfe) in this press release 
are as follows:

 strategically invest to differentiate their brands. Our advice to all: 
Tell your story. Be fully transparent — it’s valuable and expected in 
today’s market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shareholders and 
customers are changing the degree to which companies are demonstrating 
“transparency” in their day-to-day activities by asking important 
questions of executives. Questions such as: Why should I work with your 
company? What are the risks in partnering? What <b>social license</b> do
 you have to operate in my community? What does your company stand for 
in areas like ethics, diversity, community, or health and safety?</p>

network of touch points, technology creates a tangible business 
opportunity to be transparent, ultimately to generate relationships, 
solidify your brand, and increase market share,” said Bill Whitelaw, CEO
 of JWN Energy and publisher of the Daily Oil Bulletin. “At its core, 
the business value of transparency is credibility. By not using 
transparency and technology in tandem, you’re missing out on a genuine 
business opportunity and your brand will struggle.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remind yourself that your
 brand has an intrinsic business value — marketing is critical to 
growth. Reinvest by stimulating your ad spend, but don’t invest with 
just any company. By strategically partnering with JWN Energy, you can 
be assured of:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Promoting your business to a large, engaged and very well established industry audience</p>

 (“Questerre” or the “Company”) (TSX:QEC) (OSE:QEC) reported that it has
 executed a Letter of Intent with a senior exploration and production 
company (the “LOI”) to settle outstanding litigation and acquire all 
their assets in the St. Lawrence Lowlands, Quebec (the “Lowlands”).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, President and Chief Executive Officer of Questerre, 
commented, “On closing, we will gain operatorship of our acreage in the 
Lowlands. We will be in a much better position to communicate directly 
with municipalities and address local concerns and acceptability. Our 
approach is that good relationships with local communities comes first 
and development second."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, “We will 
continue our step by step approach of working with the government and 
municipalities. This project will proceed by adequately addressing their
 concerns and making sure they participate in the benefits. We are 
confident that, with success, this project will help Quebec greatly 
reduce its hydrocarbon import problem and meet its 2030 energy policy 
targets.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pursuant to the LOI, 
Questerre will acquire the exploration rights to 753,000 net acres in 
the Lowlands, associated wells and equipment, geological and geophysical
 data and other miscellaneous assets. Upon closing of the transaction, 
both parties will release each other from all claims related to the 
outstanding litigation. Other consideration including cash and the 
security required for the assumption of abandonment and reclamation 
liabilities (“A&amp;R Liabilities”) is approximately $16.10 million in 
aggregate. Questerre may post a letter of credit as security for the 
A&amp;R Liabilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Closing of the 
transaction is subject to the enactment by the Ministry of Energy and 
Natural Resources (“Ministry”) in Quebec of the following regulations 
(the “Regulations”): (i) the Regulation Respecting Petroleum 
Exploration, Production and Storage in a body of water; (ii) the 
Regulation Respecting Petroleum Exploration, Production and Storage on 
land; and (iii) the Regulation Respecting Petroleum Exploration, 
Production and Storage Licenses, and Pipeline Construction or Use 
Authorization. The Company anticipates the final Regulations could be 
published around the end of the second quarter of this year. Additional 
conditions to closing include the execution of a purchase and sale 
agreement.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Why are you running? I'm running for three reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, the three status quo parties either have no (PCs) or very weak plans (NDP &amp; Liberals) to deal with greenhouse <b>gas</b>
 emissions and climate chaos. This leads to my second reason: I have 
great-nieces and -nephews who range from 8 months to 7 years of age. 
Because our governments at all levels are doing next to nothing to 
combat climate chaos, I do not want to have them ask me 20 years from 
now, "Uncle Bill, you knew that climate change and global warming were 
real, what did you do about it?" Thirdly, I have been teaching 
Environmental Studies and Laurentian University, where I encourage 
students to stand up for things in which they believe. So, I am walking 
the talk.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. What are your qualifications for political office ?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only am I passionate 
about the things in which I believe, I listen well, am approachable, and
 I feel that I communicate very effectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. What makes you stand out from the other candidates in your riding?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two things set me apart. 
First, I belong to a party that allows its MPPs to vote as their 
constituents feel; no one in the Green Party carries a "whip". This 
allows us to better represent the interests of our ridings. Secondly, I 
am the only candidate who is championing serious change regarding how 
the province accepts responsibility for and acts in important ways to 
reduce greenhouse <b>gas</b> emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. What are your top priorities?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I want to combat climate 
change by greatly reducing our dependency on and addiction to the use of
 fossil fuels. Also, I feel we must encourage the development of local 
and organic food supplies and support the farmers who produce our food. 
Further, I feel we must promote healthy lifestyles and preventative 
health care practices society-wide as an important and less expensive 
"front end" component of solving health problems that place undue stress
 on our medical and hospital systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. Northern Ontario has struggled economically compared to other parts of the province. How would you change that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I strongly feel that we 
must support more of our local businesses and service providers as 
opposed to patronizing national or multinational operations. We need to 
develop "shop local" and "shop regional" campaigns. This would allow us 
to prevent economic leakages to head offices and shareholders elsewhere.
 We need to encourage millennials to remain in the north or to return 
here after the completion of post-secondary education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We could also work to 
dovetail the regional forestry industry with research efforts at the 
McEwen School of Architecture to create value added businesses for wood 
building products. Another idea would be to promote "staycations" that 
would allow us to spend our vacation dollars regionally and serve to 
reduce greenhouse <b>gas</b> emissions compared to long haul air flights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6. Should Northern Ontario be given more power to control its affairs?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having lived in both 
southern Ontario and the Near North for many years, I know firsthand 
that many issues that concern northerners and First Nations people 
differ from those of people in southern Ontario. For instance, most 
people from southern Ontario have no idea of the actual distance between
 the major cities or what it is like to deal with populations in decline
 or, at best, are relatively stable in terms of numbers, but are aging 
rapidly. Therefore, Northern Ontario needs to be given more power to 
control its affairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">7. What would you do with the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I would do three related things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, I would double the
 funding available. Second, I would streamline the application process 
to make it easier for small start-ups to apply. Third - and most 
importantly - I would prioritize funding projects that employ 
green/clean technologies and processes, as well as favour small local 
businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I would give special 
consideration to the business proposals of young northerners or young 
entrepreneurs moving to Northern Ontario. We need to keep and attract 
young people and realize that we must support their businesses and 
efforts by less often patronizing national and multinational operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">8. What are your thoughts on the Ring of Fire?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our provincial and 
federal governments have dropped the ball on the Ring of Fire. A lack of
 integrated, region-wide planning has led to lost time. Things were 
looking promising for a while, with Ontario and the Mattawa First 
Nations entering into a Framework Agreement - but then the Liberal 
government seemed keen to cut indigenous peoples out of the 
decision-making loop. And the Conservatives and New Democrats would do 
no better than the Liberals, as both are unrealistically promising to 
get things rolling. Development in Ontario's far north must be 
sustainable - but the Far North Act makes a mockery of that notion. 
Greens will repeal the Far North Act and we would work directly with 
Indigenous peoples from a new starting point - one that is informed by 
the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and 
the concept of free, prior and informed consent is necessary. What the 
old status quo parties don't get is that the success of resource 
projects can only happen where there is a <b>social license</b> from the
 people living in impacted communities. And that applies to chromite 
mining in the James Bay lowlands, and it also applies to a new 
ferrochrome smelter in Coniston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">9. Are you committed to finishing the four-laning of Highway 69?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this point in time, I 
feel this question is asking if we should close the gate after the horse
 has escaped. I wish the province would have invested in dedicated 
passenger rail lines from Sault Ste. Marie to Sudbury, and Sudbury to 
Toronto with several round trips per day. This could have linked up with
 the new rail and light rail services emanating out of downtown Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would have been a much
 more environmentally friendly option in many ways. We must learn to 
think outside the box and stop prioritizing private automobile travel, 
with its associated dependency on fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">10. How would you improve health-care in Sudbury?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the answer 
everyone provides includes more longterm beds, more hospital beds and 
more health professionals - and I agree with all of that. But I feel 
that there is one important component that is frequently overlooked when
 we discuss health care: we do not invest enough money or time in 
promoting healthy lifestyles as preventative measures. In short, I feel 
that we need to take more responsibility for our own health. And the 
government has to get serious about front-ending healthcare solutions. 
Rather than relying on treating the sick, we should be placing a greater
 emphasis on promoting healthy lifestyles.</p>

acquisition, sale of Trans Mountain</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal Liberals 
bought Trans Mountain to fulfill their commitment to get Alberta oil to 
the British Columbia coast after its Houston-based owner threw in the 
towel on plans to triple the pipeline’s capacity in the face of fierce 
political and public resistance, especially in B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government is already trying to find a willing buyer to take Trans Mountain off its hands. Investment bank <span class="companylink">Greenhill &amp; Co</span>.
 has been hired to pitch the project to everyone from pension-fund 
bosses to private-equity investors to pipeline companies. But the timing
 is off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No private company will 
be willing to go near Trans Mountain when the fate of the project 
remains in doubt. As long as environmentalists and other opponents 
believe they can stop the pipeline, its owner will be a political 
target. No chief executive wants to associate the corporate brand with 
scenes of pipeline protesters being led away in handcuffs, or deal with 
endless court challenges from B.C.’s NDP government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So for now, the pipeline 
can’t be flipped. The challenge for Ottawa − and Bay Street − is 
figuring out how much of the long-promised pipeline expansion must be 
built before the perceived risks begin to drop away and buyers step up 
with attractive offers. Opinions on this are all over the map.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The head of one 
investment bank, speaking anonymously because his firm desperately wants
 to work for a future buyer, told me the Liberals will not get full 
value for Trans Mountain until the project is 100-per-cent done, with 
oil flowing into tankers in Vancouver harbour.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bankers are also working on plans to help Trans Mountain win an elusive <b>social license</b> by selling the project to a consortium of public sector pension plans with solid environmental credentials, including the <span class="companylink">British Columbia Investment Management Corp</span>. It’s worth noting that the country’s biggest fund, the <span class="companylink">Canada Pension Plan Investment Board</span>, said on Tuesday that it is “not actively assessing an investment in the extension opportunity.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That language is telling. The message from CPPIB is: We’re not interested now, but call us when the noise dies down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bright minds on Bay Street are also working on solutions to the problems that drove away <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>. If First Nations groups are raising concerns about the pipeline, bring them in as co-owners, as <span class="companylink">Suncor Energy Inc</span>.
 did by partnering with the Fort McKay and Mikisew Cree First Nations on
 a recent $500-million investment in an Alberta oil storage facility. 
Canadian banks might be able to provide the financing to make those 
investments possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Infrastructure assets 
such as pipelines, and the dependable cash they kick off, are currently 
hot investments. If Mr. Trudeau can do as his grandfather did and build a
 business that supplies energy to customers who need ever-increasing 
amounts of fuel, Trans Mountain will have no shortage of buyers. But the
 government needs to reduce the risks before those investors emerge.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY, Alberta, May 11, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <span class="companylink">Questerre Energy Corporation</span>
 (“Questerre” or the “Company”) (TSX:QEC) (OSE:QEC) reported today on 
its financial and operating results for the first quarter ended March 
31, 2018.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, President and Chief Executive Officer of Questerre, 
commented, “Our production and cash flow growth this quarter was 
primarily driven by the increased investment in Kakwa. Production from 
the joint venture acreage almost doubled from the first quarter of 2017.
 With additional drilling scheduled for later this summer at Kakwa, we 
could see production dip in the next few quarters before a further 
increase by year-end.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, “Through a 
recent partnership with an experienced Montney operator, we plan to 
develop our immediately offsetting acreage. We are looking forward to 
the results from the first well given the strong condensate rates and 
low acid <b>gas</b> from our adjacent producing wells.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Highlights</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Average daily production over 2,000 boe/d for the quarter</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Adjusted funds flow from operations more than doubled to $4.7 million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Questerre partners with experienced operator to develop Kakwa North acreage</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Questerre commissions 
integration study for Jordan oil shale project Commenting on Quebec, he 
noted, “We were encouraged by comments this May from the Minister of 
Environment noting that the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources 
will soon be tabling regulations for hydrocarbons. Once finalized, we 
will be meeting with the municipalities to secure the local 
acceptability we need. We are confident there is interest in our clean <b>gas</b> pilot and its environmental and economic benefits.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Updating developments on its project in Jordan, he further added, “During the quarter, we engaged <span class="companylink">Hatch Ltd</span>.,
 a global engineering firm, to review the engineering and economics for 
our oil shale project in Jordan. The initial project will target 
production of approximately 50,000 bbls/d and will include the costs to 
upgrade the produced oil to diesel and gasoline. Once this study is 
completed, we plan to commission a more detailed pre-FEED study as we 
commence negotiations for a concession agreement.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result of the 
increased capital investment in Kakwa last year, the Company reported 
higher production volumes over prior periods. Production averaged 2,013 
boe/d for the quarter compared to 1,123 boe/d for the same period last 
year with Kakwa accounting for over three quarters of production during 
both periods. Gross revenue more than doubled to $9.54 million with 
higher production volumes benefitting from higher oil prices in the 
period. The higher revenue contributed to adjusted funds flow from 
operations of $4.65 million for the period compared to $1.41 million 
last year. The Company reported net income of $0.06 million for the 
current quarter compared to a loss of $0.52 million for the first 
quarter last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capital investment for 
the quarter focused almost exclusively on Kakwa and totaled $8.66 
million (2017: $5.32 million). The Company anticipates incremental 
investment at Kakwa in 2018 could be up to $21 million and include six 
(1.5 net) wells subject to the operator’s final plans and continued 
results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The term "adjusted funds 
flow from operations" is a non-IFRS measure. Please see the 
reconciliation elsewhere in this press release.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This news release 
contains certain statements which constitute forward-looking statements

that additional drilling will be scheduled at Kakwa this summer, the 
expectations for a further increase in production by year-end, the 
Company’s plans to develop its offsetting acreage at Kakwa through its 
partnership with an experienced Montney operator, the expectation that 
the first well could spud by June, the expectation that the final oil

plans to commission a more detailed pre-FEED study for its oil shale 
project in Jordan, its plans to commence negotiations for a concession 
agreement, and its plans for additional capital spending at Kakwa. 
Although Questerre believes that the expectations reflected in our

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barrel of oil equivalent 
(“boe”) amounts may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A 
boe conversion ratio has been calculated using a conversion rate of six 
thousand cubic feet of natural <b>gas</b> to one barrel of oil and the 
conversion ratio of one barrel to six thousand cubic feet is based on an
 energy equivalent conversion method application at the burner tip and 
does not necessarily represent an economic value equivalent at the 
wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude
 oil as compared to natural <b>gas</b> is significantly different from 
the energy equivalent of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may 
be misleading as an indication of value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This press release 
contains the terms “adjusted funds flow from operations” and “working 
capital surplus” which are non-GAAP terms. Questerre uses these measures
 to help evaluate its performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As an indicator of 
Questerre’s performance, adjusted funds flow from operations should not 
be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, cash flows 
from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. 
Questerre’s determination of adjusted funds flow from operations may not
 be comparable to that reported by other companies. Questerre considers 
adjusted funds flow from operations to be a key measure as it 
demonstrates the Company’s ability to generate the cash necessary to 
fund operations and support activities related to its major assets.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The liquefied natural <b>gas</b>
 industry that B.C.'s government has been courting would have to fit in 
with the province's tough new targets for reductions in greenhouse gases
 if it wants to do business in B.C., NDP Environment Minister George 
Heyman says.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're
 not creating a climateaction strategy around LNG," Mr. Heyman said in 
an interview on Tuesday. “We're creating a climate-action strategy, and 
LNG [proponents] and the measures they can take to show us what their 
final lowest emissions can be in an overall context of reduced industry 
emissions will fit and have to fit." The NDP this week committed to 
reducing greenhouse <b>gas</b> emissions by 40 per cent in the next 12 
years, with cuts going to 60 per cent by 2040. The province is already 
committed to 80-per-cent reductions by 2050.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics - including the B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Green caucus, which has 
been supporting the NDP government - are skeptical that the NDP can have
 a robust climate-change strategy and an LNG sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a trip to Asia 
earlier this year, Premier John Horgan met with backers of a proposed 
LNG facility for the B.C. coast, but said any such projects would have 
to be in sync with his government's climate-action plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Heyman echoed that on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We've said that's a condition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A condition is something you have to meet to proceed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Heyman said details of how it will all fit together will be worked out in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP will develop that
 plan for release in the fall aimed at reducing emissions from 
transportation and industry, each at around 39 per cent of emissions, 
and “very aggressively" in buildings and communities, which account for 
22 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he has been meeting with representatives of the forestry, oil and <b>gas</b> and other industries. “They understand their <b>social license</b> depends on being as low-carbon as possible," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Andrew Weaver, leader of the BC Greens, who has been critical of the 
NDP's interest in LNG to the point of musing about voting down the 
government on the issue, said on Tuesday that he still thinks it is 
impossible to meet the targets with a major LNG facility, but added, “It
 doesn't preclude smaller facilities from being introduced."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decade ago, the former 
BC Liberal government promised to cut emissions by 33 per cent by 2020, 
but announced, in 2015, that it could not hit that target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Heyman said the NDP 
hopes to do better than the Liberals by engaging the public and 
stakeholders on their goals, and plans on being accountable for the 
results. “We're going to not just talk about it and forget about it, but
 report on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are committed to meeting the targets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weaver said he knows 
the civil service has been looking at policy measures for years to reach
 the goal. “It's like buttons, knobs and switches. The appropriate 
buttons, knobs and switches that are going to be used will be put 
together in the coming months for a full package to be put together in 
the fall," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environmental groups 
responded to the NDP targets by suggesting on Tuesday that they hinge on
 a concerted, sustained, serious plan that will not include room for 
LNG.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement, the <span class="companylink">David Suzuki Foundation</span>
 said the government will have to act very quickly on such priority 
items as regulating and applying the carbon tax to methane emissions 
from the oil-and-<b>gas</b> sector and enacting a zero-emission vehicle standard like Quebec's to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Merran Smith, who was 
cochair of a climate solutions committee commissioned by former B.C. 
Liberal premier Christy Clark, on Tuesday commended the NDP for its 
measures, but noted that if the government plans to add LNG to the B.C. 
economy, other industries and consumers will have to cut even more 
carbon.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As
 a Canadian visiting Ottawa - in a nod to our selfie-friendly Prime 
Minister - have you ever taken a photo on Parliament Hill at the 
Centennial Flame? For shame. You might have missed the opportunity. The 
federal government has now taken its fine-toothed climate comb to that 
Centennial Flame by studying options to cut the natural <b>gas</b> and 
extinguish the flame to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. In the 
meantime, Ottawa is spending $20,000 tax dollars every year to purchase 
carbon offsets for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a bit silly. As the 
developing world is dramatically ramping up its demand for fossil fuels 
thanks to undeniably positive progress, Canada is looking at ways to 
turn a small flame into a LED light bulb.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's
 the latest move in the federal government's fourpronged climate plan: 
first, collect and spend more money; second, make life less enjoyable 
for Canadians; third, ensure politicians like Justin Trudeau and 
activists like David Suzuki carry on their carbon-intensive lifestyles; 
and fourth, look mildly ridiculous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If our politicians want 
to give the illusion that they're saving the planet with symbolic 
gestures, how about starting with themselves? Stop taking international 
flights to meetings discussing why people should take fewer 
international flights. Perhaps Face-Time the Aga Khan instead of flying 
all the way to his private island. Live a little less high on the hog. 
But their hypocrisy knows no bounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At present, Prime 
Minister Trudeau is still flying all over the world for luxury 
vacations. Minister of Environment and Climate Change Catherine McKenna 
tweets often about jetting off to climate meetings with groups of people
 who have evidently never heard of Skype. Carbon taxing premiers and 
provincial ministers are no better. And how many homes does Suzuki own? 
Politicians and bureaucrats are shuttled around using a lot of energy. 
Those trips are taxpayer-funded, so regular Canadians foot the bill 
twice - once on their own travel costs and again for the increased 
travel costs of the government class.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To what end? Those who 
supported Justin Trudeau's carbon tax schemes, hoping for tangible 
returns - via the intangible so-called <b>social license</b> - must 
surely be frustrated with the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain Pipeline 
expansion. The project got a technical go-ahead from the federal 
government a year and a half ago, yet is at a total stand-still. It 
failed to win <b>social license</b> with British Columbia gatekeepers, 
despite Albertans swallowing the carbon tax for nearly 18 months and the
 Trudeau government promising to punish all Canadians with the same tax 
grab.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Social license</b> has always been a false bill of goods, but it convinced some in the oil and <b>gas</b>
 industry that they first must be punished to achieve progress. (How's 
that working out?) Thankfully, fewer Canadians will be forced to stomach
 this political hypocrisy as the provincial defense against Trudeau's 
$35-billion annual carbon tax is mounting. Saskatchewan is taking the 
federal government to court and Manitoba's premier says he'll do the 
same, Atlantic provinces are not moving closer to carbon taxes, and 
polls show anti-carbon tax political leaders are likely to win the next 
elections in Ontario and Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign demand for fossil
 fuels makes carbon dioxide taxes here essentially pointless - unless 
you agree shipping jobs to China is a good way to lower Canada's CO2 
emissions. But if our politicians are so convinced that changing 
Canadian behaviour is the key to saving the world, the least they could 
do is lead by example. Until they do, their scolding will be 
hypocritical and their gestures will be silly at best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the day comes when the
 carbon tax is imposed on all Canadians by a heavyhanded federal 
government, take heart: together, we can gather 'round the Centennial 
LED, partaking collectively in one very long eye roll - or to ensure we 
keep warm, perhaps a louder political protest.</p>

<span class="companylink">HTC PURENERGY INC</span>. (DBA HTC PURENERGY) ANNOUNCES FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2017</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">HTC Purenergy Inc</span>. has released its audited financial results for the fiscal year ending Dec. 31, 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HTC Purenergy and its 
subsidiaries has chosen to refocus its business units in the 
Environmental Technologies Sector. The acceptance of climate change and 
the <b>social license</b> that corporations are moving towards, are upon
 us in force. Carbon footprint and the capture and management of CO2 has
 become effectively a currency of business, a vehicle for penalty and 
taxation, and a statement to shareholders who expect environmental 
responsibility from the companies they invest in. We note as well, that 
all segments of the energy sector must contribute and as such, the 
management of CO2 from combustion-fired plants, can be used not only to 
reduce emissions, but also to improve oil production, through the use of
 enhanced oil recovery ("EOR") techniques. HTC has focused its efforts 
in this area over the past few years, as EOR provides an immediate 
economic benefit to an oil company, in addition to being able to meet 
its <b>social license</b> responsibilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The natural <b>gas</b> industry has taken on a new challenge of <b>gas</b>
 cleanup of CO2, SO2 and other contaminants, while ensuring that the 
solvents and the glycols that are used in the clean-up process are 
recycled and reused, while at the same time providing a significant cost
 reduction to the customer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HTC's Delta Purification 
Division and HTC's investment in Clear Glycol &amp; Solvents Inc. are 
showing promising results, as the energy industry and many larger 
Industrial companies have joined the re3 revolution: reclaim, recycle, 
reuse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tertiary oil 
production business requires a significant amount of water for 
production of steam and at the same time a significant capital cost to 
install traditional heavy oil production technologies. The Assist Energy
 Solutions Corp.'s "SCV" technology allows the use of brackish 
production water, that normal ly would have to be disposed of or 
treated, to be used as steam for energy production. The SCV technology 
also allows the heavy oil producer to bring existing non-producing wells
 back online, with a minimal investment in capital costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Reclaim, Recycle, Reuse"

*December 31, 2016 amounts have been restated to the current basis presentation arising from the

("Pinnacle") and Clear Glycol &amp; Solvents Inc.("ClearGSI").
</pre>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total assets for the 
Period were $27,222,061 compared to $29,839,303 as at December 31, 2016.
 The primary reasons for the change is attributable to ClearGSI 
conversion from consolidation to equity accounting, and the substantial 
increase in property, plant and equipment associated with the 
development of grain and fertilizer handling facility projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Current liabilities were 
$1,584,236 for the Year as compared to $3,142,192 as at Dec. 31, 2016. 
Decrease of $1,557,956 is largely due to the reduction in overall debt 
as a result of the disposition of Pinnacle and reduced ownership in 
ClearGSI requiring equity accounting in 2017. The decrease is also due 
to the making of regular repayments on the current portion of finance 
leases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenues for the Year of 
$269,493 reflect an increase of $207,188 from Dec. 31, 2016, due to an 
increase in sales that came from HTC's subsidiary Maxx Group of 
Companies Corp. and its subsidiaries (together "Maxx Group") of 
$102,570, $66,923 comes from HTC CO2 Systems Corp. (December 31, 2016 
$30,859) and $100,000 (December 31, 2016 - $31,446) came from 
engineering and process design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Corporation had a 
commercial operating loss at December 31, 2017 of ($4,339,892) as 
compared to ($3,892,106) for the period ending December 31, 2016 for a 
net change of $447,786. The change between December 31, 2017 and 
December 31, 2016 was due to an increase in financing costs arising on 
allocation to funds on receivables due over the next few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Costs of sales reflect 
manufacturing and sales costs associated with Maxx Group. The increase 
is a result of the costs associated with inventory sales. Engineering 
and process design services include costs associated with the provision 
of consulting services. There were $100,000 costs in engineering 
projects during the Period, (2016 - $31,446). These costs resulted from 
sales reported in quarter two. There is no three-month comparison for 
this period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amortization for the 
Period reported was $370,793 (December 31, 2016 $368,124). Amortization 
in the periods are comparable with the slight increase in amortization 
relating to capital purchases. Amortization relating to buildings have 
not begun as the grain and fertilizer handling projects are still in the
 development phase. Operations are expected to commence in 2018 subject 
to project completion, at which time amortization will commence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finance expenses realized
 during the Period was $425,610 (December 31, 2016 - $14,735). The 
increase is a result of computations of interest charges on amounts 
receivable over the next few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deferred tax recovery of $1,359,877 results in tax associated with the renegotiation of the terms of the sale of <span class="companylink">Nuvision</span> resulting in recognition of the gains the year and eliminate contingent amounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Net Income for the Period
 was $2,372,965 compared to income of $3,773,662 as at December 31, 2016
 (see table above). The decrease is primarily due to fewer gains on 
dispositions realized in 2017 versus 2016. Comprehensive income (loss) 
includes the unrealized gains and losses on investments classified as 
available for sale of $(250,408) (December 31, 2016 $227,745) and 
represents the net change in the carrying value of the investments to 
the quoted value and transfer of impaired investments to the 
Consolidated Statement of Loss. These adjustments do not involve cash. 
Comprehensive Income for the Period is $2,122,557 compared to income of 
$4,001,407 as at December 31, 2016. The decrease is attributable to net 
income and the change in unrealized gain on investments classified as 
available for sale.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps
 easy to miss amid the understandable political uproar over Canadian 
pipelines (or perhaps more appropriately, our apparent inability to 
build them) was the <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span> Monthly Merchandise Trade Report in February that tracks Canada's international balance of trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report indicated 
Canada's trade deficit amounted to $2.7 billion, which widened from $1.9
 billion from the prior month, with imports advancing 1.9 per cent 
month-over-month, mostly due to higher purchases of energy products.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hidden
 within those summary numbers was the revelation that imports of energy 
products into Canada advanced by a material 15.4 per cent to $3.4 
billion, the highest level since November 2014, with the largest share 
of those imports originating from the U.S. The importation of crude oil 
and bitumen advanced 15.4 per cent, with imported refined petroleum 
products up by 24.1 per cent, the latter due largely to increased 
imports of gasoline into British Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's increased importation of oil and its products reflects a growing trend in the past two years. In December 2015, the <span class="companylink">U.S. Congress</span> ended a 40-year ban on oil exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accompanied by surging 
U.S. production, crude oil exports from the U.S. to Canada (seasonally 
adjusted), have risen from $6.4 billion from September 2015 to February 
2016, to $8.4 billion from September 2017 to February of this year, or 
by about a third.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While these numbers 
fluctuate monthly, the point is that in February, while Canada exported 
$8.8 billion in energy, it also imported $3.38 billion from 
international sources which, according to <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span>, represents a year-to-year increase of 12.3 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada produces far more 
oil than it can consume, and hence it is the world's fourth largest 
producer and third largest exporter of oil. In 2016, Canada was the 
largest foreign supplier of crude oil to the U.S., with 99 per cent of 
our oil exports directed there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada accounted for 41 per cent of total U.S. crude oil imports and 20 per cent of U.S. refinery crude oil intake. However, <span class="companylink">Natural Resources Canada</span>
 also indicated that in 2016, Canada imported crude oil and equivalents 
from many countries, including the United States (62 per cent), Saudi 
Arabia, Algeria, Nigeria and Norway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when Canadian 
attentions, both public and political, are riveted on our pernicious 
lack of pipeline access to international oil markets, we question why so
 little attention is being paid to Canada's increasing importation of 
petroleum products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It cost Canadians $3.4 
billion in February alone. To be clear, we are not arguing that a trade 
surplus or deficit is an appropriate barometer of a country's health. 
However, we do suggest that growing U.S. exports, due to deregulation, 
and our inability to build infrastructure to export our energy, is not 
beneficial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada could enhance its security of supply, reduce its trade deficit and produce fewer global greenhouse <b>gas</b> emissions if we used more of our Canadian crude oil production. A recent study by the <span class="companylink">Canadian Energy Research Institute</span>,
 using 2016 data, indicates that substituting Canadian oil wherever 
possible using space on existing pipelines, railcars and ocean tankers, 
could reduce foreign oil imports into Eastern Canada by a whopping 47 
per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This would save 
refineries $210 million and reduce Canadian emissions of carbon dioxide 
by the equivalent of more than two million tonnes, or about 5.7 per cent
 annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute also found 
that eastern Canadian refineries process just over one million barrels 
of oil per day, of which only 39 per cent originates from Western Canada
 and five per cent originates from the eastern Canadian offshore; fully 
56 per cent is imported from the United States (amounting to 260,000 
barrels of imported oil per day).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly, lower regulatory
 and fiscal costs would benefit all Canadians. Hence, we urgently need 
better policies to resolve our pipeline infrastructure problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a precarious B.C. 
government opposes oil pipelines, the Trudeau government's avowed 
transition away from fossil fuels appears to be directed solely at 
penalizing Canadian producers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is over-regulating
 domestic producers with misdirected policies that allow foreign 
petroleum imports - unimpeded by Canadian environmental laws, so-called <b>social license</b>, greenhouse <b>gas</b>
 reduction strategies and associated taxes - to flood into Canada to 
displace jobs and discourage investment. Ron Wallace has served on 
federal, provincial and territorial energy and environmental regulators 
and advisory boards. Jack Mintz is the president's fellow at the

 River-Westlock MP Arnold Viersen emphasized the need for more pipelines
 in the region, including around the Whitecourt area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pipelines are currently at maximum capacity in Alberta.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Pipelines
 are integral to the Canadian economy, but especially northern Alberta,"
 Viersen said. "Most of the petroleum products from Alberta are produced
 in northern Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It affects us immensely."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Viersen, 
alternatives for oil transportation such as railways should be ruled out
 due to the increased danger and inefficiency. Using railways also takes
 up space that could be used for other products, such as grain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's just very expensive
 to ship oil by other processes other than by pipelines," Viersen said. 
"When we already have a discounted oil price, to then have to put that 
extra cost on it just makes it a nonstarter for oil companies."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Viersen explained that less exploration leads to less people in the area, which negatively affects the local economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He noted that the region had a high of 1,800 drilling rigs in 2013, but now has only around half that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Just that alone means there's thousands of people not working," Viersen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> recently announced it 
would suspend work on the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion after 
pushback from British Columbia and environmental activists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Since Prime Minister 
Justin Trudeau has taken power, we've seen Northern Gateway get 
cancelled, we've seen the Energy East project get cancelled as well, and
 now we're look at Trans Mountain, which is probably the last major 
pipeline project that was in the cue," Viersen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also noted how the carbon tax was supposed to give Alberta "<b>social license</b>" for the building of more pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've been underneath 
the weight of a significant carbon tax before many of the other 
provinces and it doesn't seem to be helping," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Viersen said 
conservatives, including himself, are now calling on Trudeau to take 
action and convince the opposition to allow more pipeline projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's his job to convince
 these folks that these projects are in the national interest," Viersen 
said. "Coming from Alberta, all of us live on top of pipelines-steel 
pipelines-every day. We know the safety of them."</p>

 is not just pipelines that Canada has a hard time getting done. Putting
 money where the country's mouth is on climate change is turning out to 
be at least as hard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, two provinces 
turned to the courts to challenge core elements of Prime Minister Justin
 Trudeau's plan to reconcile Canada's energy ambitions with its 
climate-change obligations.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As
 previously announced, the government of British Columbia is asking that
 province's top court to clarify whether it has the constitutional 
authority to regulate the amount of bitumen oil that transits through 
its territory. The answer will not be forthcoming for a while and 
certainly not in time for the May 31 deadline set by <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> to fish or cut bait on its expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A favourable court ruling
 for B.C. could have consequences for the profitability of all future 
interprovincial pipelines, starting with the Trans Mountain expansion. 
In the immediate future, the move by the province's minority NDP 
government means that project will likely not go ahead without an 
injection of public funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If he loses the court 
battle, Premier John Horgan says he will consider the pipeline matter 
closed. But that might only happen once the province has exhausted all 
its legal recourses. If the case makes its way to the Supreme Court, 
this debate could stretch beyond the next B.C. election. The government 
of Saskatchewan has also gone to its top court to challenge the federal 
government - Trudeau's plan to impose a carbon tax on provinces that 
fail to take steps to meet the carbon-pricing threshold set by Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ontario and Alberta, 
the Conservative opposition parties support Saskatchewan's move. If 
elected to power later this spring and next year, Doug Ford and Jason 
Kenney have both said they would fight Trudeau's carbon-pricing policy 
in court. Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is planning to campaign next
 year on a promise to repeal the Liberal climate-change framework.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all the drama 
surrounding the battle to stop the Trans Mountain project, the political
 forces aligning against Trudeau's climate-change strategy are no less 
consequential. They are also just as uncompromising in their stance as 
the anti-pipeline foes, whose intractable opposition to the Trans 
Mountain project they so vehemently denounce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he set out the terms 
of his province's carbon tax challenge on Wednesday, Saskatchewan 
Premier Scott Moe argued that provinces are not subsidiaries of the 
federal government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent Supreme Court 
beer ruling demonstrated that contention has a constitutional 
foundation. But the irony that Saskatchewan is invoking the same 
federalism principle to fight Trudeau's carbon tax as B.C. is in its 
challenge to the federally backed pipeline is apparently lost on Moe and
 his federal and provincial allies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau came to power 
touting a two-pronged approach to energy and climate change. His 
government would put in place a national framework for carbon pricing 
and make a start toward meeting Canada's international obligations to 
reduce greenhouse gases. But it would also have the back of the fossil 
fuel industry as it sought to expand its reach to markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two-and-a-half years 
later, few of the protagonists in the debate have bought into Trudeau's 
proposed compromise, they have sidestepped it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notwithstanding the prime
 minister's carbon-pricing initiatives, climate change activists in B.C.
 and elsewhere and their like-minded Indigenous allies are not about to 
give a <b>social license</b> to pipeline projects. Opposition to the 
Trans Mountain expansion is more deeply rooted in concerns over the 
increased risk of oil spills at sea than in the project's contribution 
to greenhouse-<b>gas</b> emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other side of the 
debate, the Conservative opposition to Trudeau's carbon-pricing policy 
is not tied to the obstacles standing in the way of the Trans Mountain 
expansion. If those obstacles were removed tomorrow, Scheer, Ford, 
Kenney and Moe would not blink an eye in their battle against a federal 
carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Trudeau, winning the 
pipeline battle would not translate into winning the carbon-pricing war.
 It would only impose on his government an even greater obligation to 
ensure its carbon-pricing plan is equally implemented. The prime 
minister has said he will see the Trans Mountain project done, even if 
that means forcing the hand of B.C.'s government and losing support in 
B.C. before next year's federal election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By all indications, 
Trudeau will have to show the same determination to ensure his national 
climate change framework becomes a reality in every province - again, at
 some potential risk to his party's electoral fortunes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps easy to miss amid
 the understandable political uproar over Canadian pipelines (or perhaps
 more appropriately, our apparent inability to build them) was the <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span> Monthly Merchandise Trade Report in February that tracks Canada's international balance of trade.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 report indicated Canada's trade deficit amounted to $2.7 billion, which
 widened from $1.9 billion from the prior month, with imports advancing 
1.9 per cent month-over-month, mostly due to higher purchases of energy 
products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hidden within those 
summary numbers was the revelation that imports of energy products into 
Canada advanced by a material 15.4 per cent to $3.4 billion, the highest
 level since November 2014, with the largest share of those imports 
originating from the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The importation of crude 
oil and bitumen advanced 15.4 per cent, with imported refined petroleum 
products up by 24.1 per cent, the latter due largely to increased 
imports of gasoline into British Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's increased importation of oil and its products reflects a growing trend in the past two years. In December 2015, the <span class="companylink">U.S. Congress</span> ended a 40-year ban on oil exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accompanied by surging 
U.S. production, crude oil exports from the U.S. to Canada (seasonally 
adjusted), have risen from $6.4 billion from September 2015 to February 
2016, to $8.4 billion from September 2017 to February of this year, or 
by about a-third.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While these numbers 
fluctuate monthly, the point is that in February, while Canada exported 
$8.8 billion in energy, it also imported $3.38 billion from 
international sources which, according to <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span>, represents a year-to-year increase of 12.3 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada produces far more 
oil than it can consume, and hence it is the world's fourth largest 
producer and third largest exporter of oil. In 2016, Canada was the 
largest foreign supplier of crude oil to the U.S., with 99 per cent of 
our oil exports directed there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada accounted for 41 per cent of total U.S. crude oil imports and 20 per cent of U.S. refinery crude oil intake. However, <span class="companylink">Natural Resources Canada</span>
 also indicated that in 2016, Canada imported crude oil and equivalents 
from many countries, including the United States (62 per cent), Saudi 
Arabia, Algeria, Nigeria and Norway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when Canadian 
attentions, both public and political, are riveted on our pernicious 
lack of pipeline access to international oil markets, we question why so
 little attention is being paid to Canada's increasing importation of 
petroleum products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It cost Canadians $3.4 
billion in February alone. To be clear, we are not arguing that a trade 
surplus or deficit is an appropriate barometer of a country's health. 
However, we do suggest that growing U.S. exports, due to deregulation, 
and our inability to build infrastructure to export our energy, is not 
beneficial to Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada could enhance its security of supply, reduce its trade deficit and produce fewer global greenhouse <b>gas</b> emissions if we used more of our Canadian crude oil production. A recent study by the <span class="companylink">Canadian Energy Research Institute</span>,
 using 2016 data, indicates that substituting Canadian oil wherever 
possible using space on existing pipelines, railcars and ocean tankers, 
could reduce foreign oil imports into Eastern Canada by a whopping 47 
per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This would save 
refineries $210 million and reduce Canadian emissions of carbon dioxide 
by the equivalent of more than two million tonnes, or about 5.7 per cent
 annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute also found 
that eastern Canadian refineries process just over one million barrels 
of oil per day, of which only 39 per cent originates from Western Canada
 and five per cent originates from the eastern Canadian offshore; fully 
56 per cent is imported from the United States (amounting to 260,000 
barrels of imported oil per day).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly, lower regulatory
 and fiscal costs would benefit all Canadians through the more efficient
 utilization of Canadian resources. Hence, we urgently need better 
policies to resolve our pipeline infrastructure problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a precarious B.C. 
government opposes oil pipelines, the Trudeau government's avowed 
transition away from fossil fuels appears perversely to be directed 
solely at penalizing Canadian producers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is over-regulating
 domestic producers with misdirected policies that allow foreign 
petroleum imports - unimpeded by Canadian environmental laws, so-called <b>social license</b>, greenhouse <b>gas</b> reduction strategies and associated taxes - to flood into Canada to displace jobs and discourage investment.</p>

("Sherritt" or the "Corporation") (TSX: S), a world leader in the mining
 and hydrometallurgical refining of nickel and cobalt from lateritic 
ores, today reported its financial results for the first quarter ended 
March 31, 2018. All amounts are in Canadian currency unless noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CEO COMMENTARY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sherritt's results for 
Q1 reflect the positive impact of improving commodity prices and our 
continuing efforts to strengthen our balance sheet," said David Pathe, 
President and CEO of Sherritt International. "We ended the quarter with 
more cash on hand, less debt, and higher cash received from the Moa JV 
-- all clear signs of progress."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pathe added, "With 
production challenges at the Moa JV caused by excessive rainfall and 
rail transportation delays largely behind us, we are bullish about our 
prospects for the balance of 2018 given the favorable outlook for nickel
 and cobalt prices due to favorable demand trends, particularly within 
the electric vehicle battery market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q1 HIGHLIGHTS </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">   -- Average-realized prices at the Moa Joint Venture ("Moa JV") for nickel 
      improved 26% to $7.80 per pound while average-realized prices for cobalt 
      increased 100% to $48.47 per pound. 
 
   -- Sherritt ended the quarter with $237.3 million in cash, cash equivalents 
      and short-term investments, up from $203.0 million at December 31, 2017. 
 
   -- Sherritt strengthened its balance sheet by purchasing for cancellation 
      $121.2 million of outstanding debentures at an aggregate cost of $110.3 
      million through a modified Dutch auction tender offer. The transaction, 
      which was funded by a unit offering that generated net proceeds of 
      approximately $125 million, brings the total amount of indebtedness 
      eliminated by the Corporation over the past four years to approximately 
      $2 billion. 
 
   -- Received $16.0 million from the Moa JV as repayment on its working 
      capital facility and US$40.7 million in Cuban energy payments, lowering 
      overdue scheduled receivables to $126.7 million from $132.6 million at 
      year end 2017. 
 
   -- Net direct cash cost (NDCC)(1) at the Moa Joint Venture was US$2.06 per 
      pound of finished nickel sold, marking the fourth consecutive quarter 
      that the Moa JV is in the lowest cost quartile. 
   -- Sherritt's share of finished nickel production at the Moa JV was 2,854 
      tonnes in Q1 2018, down 26% from Q1 2017, while its share of finished 
      cobalt was 336 tonnes, down 23% from Q1 2017. Consistent with previous 
      disclosure, the decline in production in Q1 2018 was attributable to the 
      reduced availability of mixed sulphides due to the highest level of 
      rainfall at Moa's operations in more than 20 years and rail 
      transportation delays to the refinery in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta by 
      the rail service provider. Subsequent to quarter end, delays with rail 
      transportation service have largely been resolved and mixed sulphides 
      availability has been restored to normal levels. 
   -- Executed a three-year extension of the Puerto Escondido/Yumuri oil 
      production sharing contract to 2021. 
 
   -- Adjusted EBITDA was $36.4 million, relatively flat when compared to Q1 
      2017. Adjusted EBITDA in Q1 2018 reflected the impact of the 
      restructuring of the Ambatovy Joint Venture completed in December 2017 
      that reduced Sherritt's ownership interest from 40% to 12%. 
 
   -- Net loss for Q1 2018 was $0.6 million or $nil on a per share basis. In Q1 
      2017, net loss was $72.6 million or $0.25 per share. 
 
   -- Q1 results marked Sherritt's first full quarter of operations since its 
      ownership interest at Ambatovy was reduced to 12% as a result of the 
      Joint Venture restructuring completed in December 2017. </pre>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HIGHLIGHTS SUBSEQUENT TO QUARTER END </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">   -- Sherritt finalized the evaluation of available and proven technology to 
      complete drilling of the second well on Block 10 targeting the Lower 
      Veloz reservoir. A proven technology solution has been selected and will 
      be deployed when drilling is slated to resume in early July 2018. 
      Preliminary drilling results are expected in Q3 2018. Capital budgeted to 
      complete the drilling is expected to be approximately US$13 million. </pre>

generated consolidated cash flow from operations of $11.1 million. The 
consolidated total included $7.3 million in positive cash flow from the 
Oil and <b>Gas</b> division and $11.2 million in positive cash flow 
contributions from the Power division. Interest expenses of $11.0 
million negatively impacted the consolidated cash flow total for Q1

and short-term investments at March 31, 2018 were $237.3 million, up 
from $203.0 million at December 31, 2017. The increase was due to a 
number of factors, including the close of a unit offering that generated
 net proceeds of approximately $125 million, the receipt of $16 million 
from the Moa JV on its working capital facility and the receipt of 
US$40.7 million in Cuban energy payments. In Q4 2017, Sherritt received

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">METAL MARKETS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nickel</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nickel prices continued 
to rally in Q1 2018, sustaining the momentum established in second half 
of 2017. The average reference price in Q1 2018 was US$6.03/lb, up 29% 
from US$4.66/lb in the first quarter of 2017. The average reference 
price for Q1 2018 marked the highest since Q1 2015 when it was 
US$6.50/lb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year-over-year price 
improvement was driven by a number of developments, Chief among them is 
the growing understanding of the important role that Class I nickel will
 play in the growing electric vehicle (EV) market. Class I nickel, along
 with cobalt, are key metals needed to manufacture EV batteries. Demand 
for Class I nickel and cobalt are expected to grow significantly 
beginning in 2019 when China expects to begin production quotas 
requiring that 10% of all vehicles manufactured be electric.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sherritt Reports First Quarter 2018 Results -2-</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in the nickel reference price was also driven by the decline in inventories. Combined <span class="companylink">LME</span>
 and SHFE nickel inventories at March 31 2018, declined to 367,694 
tonnes (from 410,828 tonnes) at the start of the year. A further decline
 in visible inventories is expected to sustain the price increase 
momentum through the end of 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond 2018, nickel 
supply deficits are expected to widen as stainless steel sector growth 
is expected to outpace nickel production. The supply deficit is expected
 to be exacerbated with the rise of the electric vehicle market and the 
need for Class I nickel for battery production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cobalt</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cobalt prices rose in Q1 
2018, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of higher reference 
prices. The average-reference price for Q1 2018 was US$39.01/lb, up 97% 
from US$19.80/lb for Q1 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The near doubling of 
cobalt prices over the past year is primarily linked to the growing 
strong demand emanating from the EV battery market. Higher cobalt prices
 were also driven by geopolitical and supply risk concerns given that 
the Democratic Republic of Congo is currently the world's largest source
 of cobalt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As cobalt prices have a 
limited impact on overall battery pack costs, high prices are not 
expected to cause supply-chain disruptions or delay EV market growth. As
 a result, the risk of cobalt substitution in EV battery production in 
the near term is relatively low given cobalt's unique energy 
transference properties. While battery manufacturers continue to explore
 alternatives to cobalt, the likely beneficiary of any substitution is 
expected to be Class I nickel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the cobalt 
market's limited size, significant product orders cause price surges. As
 end-users are trying to build cobalt positions or to secure long-term 
supply, spot metal availability is sporadic and prices are expected to 
remain elevated in the near term.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(2) Average low-grade cobalt published price per Metals Bulletin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Moa JV produced 2,854
 tonnes of finished nickel in Q1 2018, down 26% from 3,840 tonnes 
produced in Q1 2017. Finished cobalt production in Q1 2018 was 336 
tonnes, down 23% from 436 tonnes produced in Q1 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The production decline in
 Q1 2018 was principally due to reduced availability of mixed sulphides 
caused by the highest level of rainfall at Moa's operations in more than
 20 years that limited access to planned mining areas as well as by 
transportation delays to the refinery by the rail service provider. The 
adverse impact of excessive rain fall and rail transportation delays 
have been alleviated since the start of the second quarter, and Sherritt
 expects to achieve the lower end of its 2018 production guidance for 
finished nickel and finished cobalt at the Moa JV. Second quarter 
production will be impacted, however, by the annual shutdown of the 
refinery in Fort Saskatchewan due to scheduled maintenance activities. 
This year's shutdown is expected to be similar in duration to prior 
years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q1 2018 revenue for the 
Moa JV and the Fort Site totaled $96.3 million, up 7% from $90.4 million
 for the comparable period of 2017. The growth was driven by higher 
realized prices in 2018 for nickel (+26%), cobalt (+100%) and fertilizer
 (+4%) although offset by lower sales volume and a higher Canadian 
dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nickel sales represented 
52% of total Q1 2018 revenue while cobalt sales represented 36%. 
Fertilizer sales in Q1 2018 were down 29% from last year, reflecting 
lower demand and timing of shipments ahead of the spring season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mining, processing and 
refining (MPR) costs for Q1 2018 were US$5.26 per pound, up 11% from 
US$4.75 per pound for Q1 2017. The increase was due to the impact of 
lower production as well to higher input costs, including increased 
sulphur and energy costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite higher energy and
 sulphur input costs and lower production, Moa's NDCC of US$2.06/lb for 
Q1 2018 was in the lowest cost quartile relative to other nickel 
producers, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of such distinction. 
NDCC in Q1 2018 declined by 37% compared to the prior year period, 
largely because of a higher cobalt by-product credit. The cobalt credit 
of US$4.27/lb reflects Moa's high cobalt to nickel production ratio as 
well as the 100% growth in cobalt prices since Q1 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given current commodity 
prices and the expected rate of production for the balance of the year, 
NDCC guidance at Moa for 2018 has been lowered to US$1.75/lb to 
US$2.25/lb from US$2.50/lb to US$3.00/lb of finished nickel previously 
announced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash provided by 
operations in Q1 2018 totaled $18.1 million, up 22% from $14.8, 
reflecting the year-over-year improvement in commodity prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moa's sustaining capital 
spending in Q1 2018 was $4.5 million, up from $2.1 million in Q1 last 
year. The increase was due to planned spending, including the start of 
work at a new slurry preparation plant dump pocket at Moa. The Moa JV is
 expected to continue to operate and fund capital expenditures through 
cash flow generated by the joint venture, or external loans.</p>

Sherritt Reports First Quarter 2018 Results -3-</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sherritt's financial 
results at Ambatovy are presented on a 12% basis for Q1 2018 and on a 
40% basis for Q1 2017. Production totals are presented on a 12% for both
 periods for better comparison purposes. Along with its partners, 
Sherritt completed the restructuring of the Ambatovy Joint Venture on 
December 11, 2017. The restructuring led to Sherritt's ownership 
interest being reduced to 12% in exchange for the elimination of $1.4 
billion of debt. Sherritt will continue to serve as operator of Ambatovy
 at least through 2024, however, as a result of the reduction in its 
ownership interest, Sherritt's ability to direct local decision-making 
at Ambatovy has diminished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On January 6, the 
operations of the Ambatovy Joint Venture were significantly impacted by 
Tropical Cyclone Ava, a Category 2 hurricane equivalent storm. The 
cyclone necessitated a plant shutdown and caused extensive damage to 
facilities and equipment. Production resumed at the end of January 
following the completion of critical repairs. Repairs to damage caused 
by Cyclone Ava are still ongoing. Metal production in Q1 2018 was also 
lower due to limited production of sulphuric acid as a result of a 
failed economizer in Acid Plant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consistent with previous 
disclosure, metal production at Ambatovy will continue to be constrained
 by lower production of sulphuric acid in Q2 2018. Lower production of 
sulphuric acid is due to the failed economizer in Acid Plant 1, which is
 currently operating at approximately 50% of capacity. Acid Plant 2 is 
operating at 100% capacity. Production capacity is expected to be back 
to normal once the economizer in Acid Plant 1 is replaced in May 2018. 
Replacement of the economizer will necessitate a shutdown of Acid Plant 1
 for approximately three weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finished nickel 
production at Ambatovy in Q1 2018 was 668 tonnes (12% basis), down from 
1,145 tonnes (12% basis) produced in Q1 2017. Finished cobalt production
 in Q1 2018 was 49 tonnes (12% basis), down from 97 tonnes (12% basis) 
for Q1 2017. The decline was principally due to the impact of Cyclone 
Ava and effects of the failed economizer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MPR costs for Q1 2017 
were US$7.90 per pound, up from US$5.53 per pound in Q1 2017. The 
year-over-year increase was largely due to the impact of lower 
production volumes in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NDCC for finished nickel 
at Ambatovy in Q1 2018 was US$5.34/lb, up from the US$3.93/lb for Q1 
2017. The increase was due to lower production, higher maintenance costs
 and higher energy and sulphur input costs offset by higher cobalt 
by-product credits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In light of current

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(2) Starting in 2018, the Oil and <b>Gas</b>
 division uses U.S. Gulf Coast High Sulphur Fuel Oil for pricing 
purposes, replacing U.S. Gulf Coast Fuel Oil #6 used previously. The 
comparative period has been adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross working-interest 
oil production in Q1 2018 in Cuba was 5,572 barrels of oil per day 
("bopd"), down 63% from 15,213 bopd for the comparable period of 2017. 
The decrease was primarily due to the expiration of the Varadero West 
Production Sharing Contract (PSC) in November 2017, natural reservoir 
declines and the absence of new development drilling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue in Q1 2018 was 
$18.1 million, down 49% from $35.3 million for last year. The decline 
was due to lowered production, partially offset by an increase in 
realized prices of 17% to $51.11 per barrel in Cuba, though partially 
offset by the negative impact of a stronger Canadian dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total net 
working-interest production for Q1 2018 was 3,916 barrels of oil 
equivalent per day ("boepd"), down from 8,889 boepd in the same period 
of 2017. The decline was due to the impact of the expiration of the 
Varadero West PSC already noted and the impact of higher oil prices in 
2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unit operating costs in 
Q1 2018 in Cuba were $20.83 per barrel, up 141% from $8.66 in Q1 2017, 
driven largely by reduced production. Costs were positively impacted by 
the strengthening Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar in Q1 
2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exploration spending in 
Q1 2018 was lower than in the comparable period of 2017 as spending was 
primarily focused on detailed engineering for the next well on Block 10.
 In Q1 2017, drilling on the first well on Block 10 was being completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subsequent to quarter 
end, Sherritt finalized the evaluation of available and proven 
technology to complete drilling of the second well on Block 10 targeting
 the Lower Veloz reservoir. A proven technology solution has been 
selected and will be deployed when drilling is slated to resume in early
 July 2018. Preliminary drilling results are expected in Q3 2018. 
Capital budgeted to complete the drilling is expected to be 
approximately US$13 million.</p>

 investors spooked by the uncertainty plaguing the planned Trans 
Mountain pipeline expansion, Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr said 
Friday as a high-level, make-or-break meeting loomed on the horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government is still 
examining its options, Carr said, but won't commit to a course of action
 before Sunday, when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau jets home from Peru 
for a hastily organized meeting in Ottawa with British Columbia Premier 
John Horgan and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What
 we're now faced with is to find ways to make sure there is more 
certainty than there is now," Carr said in an interview with The <span class="companylink">Canadian Press</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One of the ways to make 
sure there is more certainty is to look at possible financial 
arrangements that would help de-risk the project."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pipeline builder Kinder 
Morgan has halted all non-essential spending on the project until it 
gets assurances from Ottawa that the issues will be resolved. The 
federal government has until May 31 to respond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau has put a lot of 
political eggs in the Trans Mountain basket, risking political capital 
among climate-change activists in search of middle ground that allows 
for pipeline construction alongside improved <span class="companylink">environmental safeguards</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau, who is currently
 in Peru for the Summit of the Americas, was originally supposed to fly 
to Paris directly from Lima on Sunday for meetings with French President
 Emmanuel Macron. Instead, he'll be back in the national capital in 
search of a resolution to an intractable — and politically perilous — 
dispute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carr refused to discuss 
the specific financial options available, other than to say there are 
many of them on the table and they're all being considered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of those options, 
however, is to buy a stake in the pipeline, something Notley has already
 said Alberta would be willing to do. Canada and Alberta could jointly 
buy the pipeline outright, or at least a significant stake in the 
project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another option is to 
provide a guaranteed source of revenue for private investors if the 
pipeline completion date misses the target for when returns on their 
investments were supposed to start flowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company had targeted 
May 31 as the make-or-break deadline to start construction if the 
pipeline was to hit those investment targets. That date is now the 
drop-dead date <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> has given Canada to prove the company should have the confidence to move forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Political strategist 
Robin Sears, a principal at Earnscliffe Strategy Group, said another 
option would be to increase spending on the environmental protection 
side, including on improved research into preventing and mitigating the 
impacts of a diluted bitumen spill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The company has not done
 what it needs to have done to satisfy the people of B.C. they have 
taken the steps necessary to protect the environment," said <span class="companylink">Sears</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sears said the Trudeau 
government has an oceans protection plan on paper, but hasn't done much 
if anything to put it into action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carr was only prepared to
 say Sunday's meeting between Trudeau and the premiers would be a chance
 for the various sides to share their positions and try and talk things 
out — not necessarily a day when further action would be announced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, said <span class="companylink">Sears</span>, would be a bad political move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If they come out of that
 meeting on Sunday and (Trudeau) says, 'We've made good progress and I'm
 off to Paris,' it will cost them severely," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">University of British 
Columbia politics professor Kathryn Harrison said she doesn't know that 
there is a way for everyone to come out of Sunday's meeting with a win.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They have drawn lines in the sand that are simply incompatible," said Harrison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau and Carr have 
spent more than two years accusing the former Conservative government of
 themselves failing to build pipelines because they stacked the deck 
against environmental concerns, failing in the process to get the <b>social license</b> necessary to allow the projects to proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals introduced new review processes that accounted for things like the potential greenhouse <b>gas</b> emissions resulting from increased oil flows. The <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>'s 2016 approval of Trans Mountain required monitoring and upstream emissions offsets related to construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But environmental 
concerns remain — including the risk of higher emissions from increased 
oilsands production and the environmental impact of a spill. As a 
result, environmentalists who helped get Trudeau elected are now 
doubting his commitment to the cause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harrison said Trudeau has
 staked a claim on being able to reconcile both interests, offering up 
the pipeline — and the resulting ability to get resources to market — as
 a quid pro quo to get provincial and stakeholder support for a carbon 
price and environmental investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That was the compromise 
and they got pretty far with it," Harrison said, noting all provinces 
but Saskatchewan signed onto the climate change framework.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're at that point now

 )</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome to government, 
where events never pause and most days are an endless series of bad and 
worse choices. Trudeau is certainly down to bad and worse on the 
question of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s crown jewel, which happens to double as his fig-leaf on oil and <b>gas</b> policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau the green 
carbon-taxer might really, really (really) want this singular pipeline 
built, but if the company building it is now wavering, and the Green 
party dependent NDP premier of the province through which it must pass 
hasn't yet found a body he won't chuck in front of it, at what point do 
you call a spade no spade and concede the Earth will not be moving?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps fearing for its economic and constitutional credibility, the answer from Team Trudeau is a ringing "not now, not ever."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are determined to see
 (Trans Mountain) built," Trudeau has told reporters. "It is in the 
national interest. It doesn't make any sense for us to continue to have a
 $15-billion discount on our oil resources because we are trapped with 
an American market. We need to get our resources to new markets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed. The same words could have - and did - come out of Stephen Harper's mouth. Trudeau now has to bell the cat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Green Party Leader Elizabeth May, centre, is arrested by RCMP officers after joining protesters outside <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s facility in Burnaby, B.C., on March 23, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't meant to be 
this way. Harper's confrontational "cram-them-down-your-throats" 
pipeline policy was to be replaced with Trudeau's more charismatic 
approach that would accrue the "<b>social license</b>" needed to grease 
construction, a canard that happens to be, despite the environmental 
hysteria, the only fauna killed to date along the pipeline's route.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To frame the debate as pro-economy versus pro-environment is to miss the point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Trans Mountain 
ultimately proves is the past 20 years of debate in Canada has split 
people into two irreconcilable camps: pro-oil and anti-oil. Preening at 
climate summits and taxing carbon won't make exporting oil kosher to 
those who are resolutely opposed. Over their dead bodies is the message 
being passed to Trudeau at the minute. It's not a question of law, it's a
 matter of will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Giddy though the 
opposition parties might be, now is not the time for them to revel in 
Trudeau's mire. Seeing your opponent hoist with his own petard is 
satisfying, but if the pipeline really is in Canada's national interest -
 and it is - the opposition should offer some constructive suggestions 
along with any withering scorn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the rather shouty and petty state of modern politics, this won't happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The partisan urge to 
nanny-nanny-boo-boo is too strong and besides, Conservatives will say, 
the Liberals didn't exactly lift a finger of support in opposition 
before assuming office and turning the matter into a constitutional 
crisis. Further disincentivizing bipartisan efforts is the Trudeau 
carbon tax, a big part of the government's <b>social license</b> play that is not particularly well-read by any capital-C Conservative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Alberta Premier Rachel Notley talks to cabinet members about the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline expansion, in Edmonton on Monday, April 9, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here, Trudeau shoulders a
 good chunk of the blame. For all his talk of kumbaya, Trudeau's Pan 
Canadian Framework for Clean Energy and Climate Change - with its plan 
for carbon "pricing" - was effectively crammed down provincial throats. 
And with Rachel Notley and Kathleen Wynne's governments now in severe 
financial distress, voters there and across Canada will surely begin to 
wonder why the hell they're on the road to higher taxes if those uppity 
British Columbians aren't holding up their end of the <b>social-license</b> bargain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is where federal NDP
 leader Jagmeet Singh should have a useful intervention to make, given 
it's his provincial brethren on opposite sides of the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 dispute. But to hope for substance from Singh is to wish for unicorns. 
Singh has done the easy thing and sided with B.C. and its brighter 
federal electoral prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where does this leave Trans Mountain? Shorn of friends and solutions, but all is not yet lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government can, and 
should, re-assert its constitutional right to build the pipeline. And 
yes, the feds can join Alberta in slapping down money and insurance 
guarantees. But that's only half the battle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Protesters chant as they wait for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's arrival to meet with members of the <span class="companylink">Canadian Coast Guard</span> to discuss marine safety and spill prevention, in Victoria on Thursday, April 5, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the communities along 
the pipeline route remain ready to obstruct its construction it's going 
to take a lot more than bucks and words to clear the way. Even the stern
 words of a judge urging protesters out of the way might not do the 
trick. What then?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do the sunny ways of Trudeau the son even allow for a hint of the army steel flashed by his father? Do we just ... watch him?</p>

 who have grown increasingly concerned about the barriers facing 
Canada's energy industry have even more reason to despair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's well known that 
Canada's regulatory environment is among the most robust in the world, 
ensuring the highest regard for the environment, including limiting 
greenhouse <b>gas</b> emissions. In recent years, Alberta has imposed a 
carbon tax and capped oilsands emissions in the naive hope of securing 
so-called <b>social license</b> for pipeline development. Everyone knows how that has turned out.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An
 ocean away, the United Nations body that regulates the international 
shipping industry is meeting in London this week to see if it can agree 
on a strategy to reduce emissions from the cargo ships, oil tankers and 
other vessels that traverse the planet's oceans. This is serious work, 
because such emissions were excluded from the Paris Climate Agreement in
 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This means that when 
Eastern Canada buys its fuel from countries such as Saudi Arabia, 
Azerbaijan, Nigeria and Angola, the oil isn't just produced using less 
rigorous environmental standards than those in Canada. It also means the
 oil tankers that transport foreign oil to our shores aren't subjected 
to controls on their greenhouse <b>gas</b> emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">UN</span>'s <span class="companylink">International Maritime Organization</span> says such vessels risk becoming the singlelargest source of planet-warming greenhouse gases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet Eastern Canadians welcome the tankers with open arms, while vehemently opposing Canadian pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If action isn't taken, 
the organization says emissions from shipping could grow by up to 250 
per cent by 2050. International shipping emissions are not assigned to 
any one country, according to The <span class="companylink">Canadian Press</span>,
 but on their own, they are higher than the total emissions from all but
 the six biggest national emitters - China, the United States, India, 
Russia, Japan and Germany.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's an indignity that 
Albertans and their economy have been placed in a straitjacket for no 
apparent purpose by Premier Rachel Notley and Prime Minister Justin 
Trudeau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government 
even changed the rules recently to require future pipeline projects to 
calculate the upstream and downstream environmental emissions - which is
 pollution produced during extraction and when the fuel is burned in 
vehicles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No such burden is placed 
on Eastern Canadian carmakers or plane manufacturers, of course. Or on 
ships that deliver foreign oil to Eastern ports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta is being unfairly treated.</p>

 SACHEDINA: Hello everyone, and welcome to "Power Play" for Friday, 
April 6th, the day when of fears of a US trade war with China sent the 
Dow plunging more than 500 points to the end week. More on that in just a
 moment. Coming up on the show, we'll talk to federal Conservative 
leader Andrew Scheer about trade tensions between Canada and the US, and
 his new demand that he will only accept a private classified briefing 
about the prime minister's trip to India after MPs get an unclassified 
one first. Also ahead, the prime minister's trip to Canada's oil 
heartland and how successful he was in winning over those who say his 
leadership on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion has been weak. And 
mega millionaire Kevin O'Leary talks to us about the money troubles 
stemming from his failed Conservative campaign bid. But first, a steep 
sell-off on the markets today after Donald Trump threatens China with an
 additional $100 billion in new tariffs, but the US's trading 
relationship with Canada and Mexico was also in the spotlight today. 
With his take on how <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> talks are 
going, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer joins me now. Mr. Scheer, it's 
great to have you on. I want to play a clip of the prime minister who 
was in Fort McMurray today and then get your reaction on that if we can.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
JUSTIN TRUDEAU (Canadian Prime Minister): We're pleased at the amount of
 chapters that have been closed, at the progress that has been made on a
 number of issues, but we're going to keep going and demonstrate that we
 take this issue very seriously. We'll continue to defend Canadian jobs,
 but we're hopeful to get positive news in the coming times. We're going
 to accept a good deal for Canada, not just any old deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: There is word 
that there may be an agreement in principle they may be ready to sign 
and approve at the Summit of the Americas next week. Can you at least 
give the government credit for coming as far as they have?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
ANDREW SCHEER (Conservative Leader): Well I'll give the government 
credit in the sense that dealing with President Trump on trade is no 
easy task. Usually you have a president that has a philosophical 
approach, either a free marketer or a protectionist, and you can kind of
 see that applied across. Mr. Trump seems to have a sector-by-sector 
approach all through the lens as to whether or not the US has a trade 
surplus or deficit in each specific commodity, which is not a 
conventional way to adopt that. We've been critical of the Liberal 
response early on. We think that they were late to the game in building 
the alliances throughout the US that we needed to build to get American 
pressure on the US administration. That started to happen recently, but 
we would have liked to have seen it earlier. We've been supportive of 
the government's efforts. I led a Conservative delegation down to 
Washington to show that united front. We want to help. We want Canada to
 get the very best deal that we can. It's so important. It transcends 
political lines. Encouraged to see the focus on actual market access and
 trade. You'll remember the Liberals were trying to bring in a lot of 
social policy into the negotiations, that didn't seem to go well. We 
hear a lot of talk that they've now pulled back from that and are 
focusing more on the economics and the reduction of trade barriers. 
We'll have to wait and see what comes out, though. No one has any 
details on specifics. We don't know if this is a general agreement with 
not a lot of details, or if this is a more substantial conclusion. We'll
 have more to say once we know what's in the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: One of the issues that you have not been supportive of is the government's plan when it comes to reducing greenhouse <b>gas</b>
 emissions. You have spoken out strongly about the carbon tax, and this 
was one of the issues that has come up during the prime minister's tour 
of western Canada. First of all, do you believe that global warming is 
manmade? SCHEER: I believe that human beings absolutely have an impact 
on climate change. I believe that human beings emit all kinds of things 
into our environment that we need to address, that we need to reduce 
what we do emit into the environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: So if it's not a carbon tax, I haven't heard you talk much about what your plan is to reduce greenhouse <b>gas</b>
 emissions. SCHEER: Well keep in mind that the previous Conservative 
government actually reduced emissions without a carbon tax. We did that 
through incentivizing efficiencies, with, in encouraging people to, all 
kinds of things, from retrofitting their homes to regulating emissions 
on a sector-by-sector approach. I believe it's possible. But I'd like to
 flip this around a little bit, because here we have the environment 
minister and the prime minister both not being able to say how much the 
carbon tax will reduce emissions by. They were asked point blank 
questions, the minister of environment at committee, Justin Trudeau by 
myself in question period, I asked him by how much will emissions go 
down with a carbon tax. They don't have an answer. So I would challenge 
them to say what is the proof that the carbon tax actually works? 
Canadians don't support it. It hasn't given us the so-called <b>social license</b> to get important energy projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: But there are 
targets that Canada has signed on to in the Paris accord. So if you were
 to be prime minister after next year's election, is that an accord that
 you would stay in, or would you withdraw from that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: Well, we voted in
 favour of the motion upholding the Paris accord targets. I would also 
point out that after campaigning against the Conservative targets for 
reductions of greenhouse emissions, Justin Trudeau went to Paris and 
signed on to the exact same targets the Conservatives were proposing. So
 he's adopted our approach on this. But one thing that's not our 
approach is a carbon tax. I'm against it. I will repeal it. I don't 
believe it will reduce emissions. I think there's a more positive way to
 incentivize people and companies to reduce emissions without just 
grabbing more money from the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: I want to talk
 a little bit about the Atwal affair and switch gears. Today you are now
 saying that you will not accept this private classified briefing until 
MPs get one that's unclassified. Is there a danger here? Are you worried
 that you're overplaying your hand? I mean you know there's a filibuster
 in the house. MPs were up for a long time. You can basically just claim
 victory and walk away. Why this new demand now? SCHEER: It's not a new 
demand. When you look at the letter that I sent the clerk of the Privy 
Council, it was saying, look, we'll have a briefing, and we'll have it 
all together, and we'll go through all the publicly available 
information that can be disseminated publicly, and then anything 
classified I will stay and receive that. In a counter response, the 
clerk, Daniel Jean, has effectively indicated he'd be willing to go to 
committee. The reason why I'm concerned about this is because just a few
 weeks ago, Justin Trudeau used his majority on that committee, on the 
very committee that now Daniel jean is offering to go in front of, used 
his majority to vote against inviting him to committee. So their track 
record on this is not one that I have a lot of confidence in. They voted
 against the motion to invite him to testify. They put their MPs through
 20 hours of a marathon vote in order to avoid the very thing that now 
we're seeing. So all I've said to the Privy Council office is, great, 
happy to have a classified briefing, let me know when the public 
briefing takes place and then we can work on a date after that. I 
believe it's so important. Why the cover-up? Why they're going to such 
great lengths to avoid what was already told to reporters and 
journalists being told to parliament. We have conflicting information. 
Ralph Goodale , the minister of public safety, says that if we want to 
know information we can read it all in the media because it's all been 
reported, and then we have journalists who were on the call, on that 
conference call saying, no, no, we were told not to report some things. 
So there's, someone is not saying something that's true, and we want to 
get to the bottom of this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: So walk me through this. When will that briefing happen with you, and when will it happen with the committee?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: Well, as, my 
understanding is that Mr. Jean has reached out to the chair of the 
committee, the Liberal chair. We want that to happen very quickly. We 
want Liberals on that committee to support the idea of having a public 
hearing on this. We understand that there are some things that the 
national security advisor would know that's classified that can't be 
said in a public forum. That's fine. And he can instruct the committee 
as to when that happens. But everything that was said to journalists and
 reporters, I believe it's only right that the Canadian people have 
their elected representatives hear the same thing. After that I will 
very quickly find the right time to have that briefing on the classified
 side as was offered to me. I think that's important too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: I also want to
 get your reaction. We know that Rob Ford , who is vying to be Ontario's
 premier, is not going to have a campaign bus for journalists. What's 
your reaction to that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: I really don't have one. I don't know the logistics of running.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: Surely you must be able to say something about that. Do you support the idea or not?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: Look, every 
individual campaign will come up with their own media strategy. I have a
 media plan myself. I try to be as accessible as I can and speak to 
journalists when they're covering topics that they want to hear my voice
 on. We'll have our own plan for the federal campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: But this is a 
guy, if you're prime minister, you might have to work alongside. Can you
 say, you have talked about the role of the media, you know the previous
 Conservative government had somewhat of a fractious relationship with 
the media. Do you endorse Mr. Ford's...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: I really don't 
have views on how other people run their campaigns. When I ran for the 
leadership I had my own plan, I was often asked to comment on other 
people's style or other people's camps. I do my own thing. I run my own 
campaign. I'll be happy to work with the next premier of Ontario on 
issues. Hopefully it's a Conservative premier who wants to repeal the 
carbon tax, who wants to balance the budget and lower taxes. We'll work 
together on issues. I'm not going to weigh in on how he runs his 
campaign, whether or not he has a media bus or prints certain types of 
flyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: Then let me 
ask you this. Are journalists going to be allowed on your campaign bus 
in the campaign next year and on the plane?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: You know what, we
 haven't actually got to the point where we know exactly what we're 
doing in terms of buses and planes, but we'll have a healthy contingent 
of media officials at our events. It's important that I get my message 
out to as many people as I can, and of course the traditional media will
 be important, as will new media, as will new platforms to communicate 
to Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: All right, Mr. Scheer, great having you on. Thanks so much for joining us today. SCHEER: Thank you very much.</p>

 (“Questerre” or the “Company”) (TSX:QEC) (OSE:QEC) reported on the 
progress of the internal feasibility study for its oil shale project in 
Jordan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company has recently engaged <span class="companylink">Hatch Ltd</span>.
 (“Hatch”), a global engineering firm, to integrate and support its 
internal work on the technical and economic feasibility of this project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “This
 is an important milestone. Our preliminary feasibility work has been 
completed. It has not identified any red flags or unexpected technical 
challenges. It also suggests this project could be economic at today’s 
oil prices. We are looking forward to the results of the Hatch 
integration study later this summer to endorse our internal work.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commenting on next steps 
Mr. Binnion added, “Depending on the results of this integration study, 
we would move to pre-FEED engineering. These results and the subsequent 
pre-FEED and FEED engineering will form part of the proposed work 
program for the pre-development phase of a future concession agreement 
with the Jordanian government.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, the 
Company completed a review of the last of its nine studies covering all 
four aspects of the production of crude oil from its project in Jordan. 
These include mining and feed preparation, retorting, power, including 
utilities and infrastructure, and marketing and refining. The studies 
were completed by independent engineering firms including Hatch to 
develop technical and cost-effective solutions for these processes. Due 
to the size of the existing Jordanian refining infrastructure and the 
market for crude products in Jordan, the Company has included the costs 
to upgrade the produced crude oil to finished products including 
gasoline and diesel. Hatch completed four of the nine studies and will 
integrate all the studies into an independent assessment. The design 
basis for this assessment will be an initial project capable of 
sustaining production of 50,000 bbls/d.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The feasibility study 
follows the assessment of the oil shale resource completed by an 
independent qualified resource evaluator, Millcreek Mining Group, in 
accordance with National Instrument 51-101 – Standards of Disclosure for
 Oil and <b>Gas</b> Activities of the Canadian Securities Administrators (“NI 51-101”) and the Canadian Oil and <b>Gas</b>
 Evaluation Handbook (“COGE Handbook”) (the “Resource Assessment”). The 
Resource Assessment estimates a best estimate of Discovered Petroleum 
Initially In Place (“DPIIP”) of between 7.8 billion and 12.2 billion 
barrels. The Resource Assessment was prepared in accordance with NI 
51-101 and the COGE Handbook with an effective date of October 1, 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DPIIP was the most 
specific assignable category of resources at the time of the Resource 
Assessment given the preliminary nature of the Resource Assessment, the 
nature of recovery of the hydrocarbons by means of mining and retorting 
and that a program of work to determine commercial viability using 
established technology had not yet been completed. In addition, as a 
result of the preliminary nature of the Resource Assessment, it did not 
contain any estimates regarding the timing or cost to obtain commercial 
development. The accuracy of resource estimates is, in part, a function 
of the quality and quantity of available data and of engineering and 
geological interpretation and judgment. Given the data available at the 
time the Resource Assessment was prepared, the estimates presented 
therein are considered reasonable. The availability of additional data 
and analysis, after the date of the estimates, may necessitate 
revisions. These revisions may be material. There is no certainty that 
any portion of the resources will be discovered. If discovered, there is
 no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion
 of the resources.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advisory Regarding Forward-Looking Statements</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This news release 
contains certain statements which constitute forward-looking statements 
or information (“forward-looking statements”) including the discovery of
 resources in respect of the Jordan oil shale project and the commercial
 viability of producing any resources so discovered, the Company’s 
opinion that its preliminary feasibility work has not identified any 
unexpected technical challenges, that preliminary feasibility work 
suggests the project could be economic at current oil prices, the 
Company’s expectations of the timing and results from the Hatch 
integration study, the timing and decision to proceed to pre-FEED and 
FEED engineering, the Company’s plans to include this in the 
pre-development phase of a future concession agreement with the 
Jordanian government and its plans to apply for this concession 
agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forward-looking 
statements are based on a number of material factors, expectations or 
assumptions of Questerre which have been used to develop such statements
 and information, but which may prove to be incorrect. Although 
Questerre believes that the expectations reflected in these 
forward-looking statements are reasonable, undue reliance should not be 
placed on them because Questerre can give no assurance that they will 
prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements address future 
events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks 
and uncertainties. The Company choose to base their study on a 50,000 
barrel per day project, as that is the amount of production required to 
justify the cost of upgrading the product produced by the Company, such 
cost being factored into such feasibility study. There is nothing to 
indicate that this level of production will actually be achieved in 
respect of the Jordan oil shale project, as there is no history of 
production and no reserves have been attributed to such property. 
Although the Company believes that this assumption is reasonable in 
light of the current information available to it at this time, there is a
 significant risk that such level of production will not be achieved and
 that the estimated total capital and operating costs set forth above 
will not be achieved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further, events or 
circumstances may cause actual results to differ materially from those 
predicted as a result of numerous known and unknown risks, 
uncertainties, and other factors, many of which are beyond the control 
of the Company, including, without limitation: whether the Company's 
exploration and development activities respecting its prospects will be 
successful or that material volumes of petroleum and natural <b>gas</b> 
reserves will be encountered, or if encountered can be produced on a 
commercial basis; the ultimate size and scope of any hydrocarbon bearing
 formations on its lands; that drilling operations on its lands will be 
successful such that further development activities in these areas are 
warranted; that Questerre will continue to conduct its operations in a 
manner consistent with past operations; results from drilling and 
development activities will be consistent with past operations; the 
general stability of the economic and political environment in which 
Questerre operates; drilling results; field production rates and decline
 rates; the general continuance of current industry conditions; the 
timing and cost of pipeline, storage and facility construction and 
expansion and the ability of Questerre to secure adequate product 
transportation; future commodity prices; currency, exchange and interest
 rates; regulatory framework regarding royalties, taxes and 
environmental matters in the jurisdictions in which Questerre operates; 
and the ability of Questerre to successfully market its oil and natural <b>gas</b>
 products; changes in commodity prices; changes in the demand for or 
supply of the Company's products; unanticipated operating results or 
production declines; changes in tax or environmental laws, changes in 
development plans of Questerre or by third party operators of 
Questerre's properties, increased debt levels or debt service 
requirements; inaccurate estimation of Questerre's oil and <b>gas</b> 
reserve and resource volumes; limited, unfavourable or a lack of access

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resource Definitions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resources encompasses all
 petroleum quantities that originally existed on or within the earth's 
crust in naturally occurring accumulations, including Discovered and 
Undiscovered (recoverable and unrecoverable) plus quantities already 
produced. "Total resources" is equivalent to "Total Petroleum Initially 
In Place". Resources are classified in the following categories:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total Petroleum Initially
 In Place ("TPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is estimated to 
exist originally in naturally occurring accumulations. It includes that 
quantity of petroleum that is estimated, as of a given date, to be 
contained in known accumulations, prior to production, plus those 
estimated quantities in accumulations yet to be discovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovered Petroleum 
Initially In Place ("DPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is 
estimated, as of a given date, to be contained in known accumulations 
prior to production. The recoverable portion of discovered petroleum 
initially in place includes production, reserves, and Contingent 
Resources; the remainder is unrecoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources are 
those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established 
technology or technology under development but which are not currently 
considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more 
contingencies. Economic Contingent Resources (“ECR”) are those 
contingent resources that are currently economically recoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undiscovered Petroleum 
Initially In Place ("UPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is 
estimated, on a given date, to be contained in accumulations yet to be 
discovered. The recoverable portion of undiscovered petroleum initially 
in place is referred to as "prospective resources" and the remainder as 
"unrecoverable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective Resources are
 those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application 
of future development projects. Prospective resources have both an 
associated chance of discovery and a chance of development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unrecoverable is that 
portion of DPIIP and UPIIP quantities which is estimated, as of a given 
date, not to be recoverable by future development projects. A portion of
 these quantities may become recoverable in the future as commercial 
circumstances change or technological developments occur; the remaining 
portion may never be recovered due to the physical/chemical constraints 
represented by subsurface interaction of fluids and reservoir rocks. 
Uncertainty Ranges are described by the Canadian Oil and <b>Gas</b> Evaluation Handbook as low, best, and high estimates for reserves and resources as follows:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low Estimate: This is 
considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities
 recovered will exceed the low estimate. If probabilistic methods are 
used, there should be at least a 90 percent probability (P90) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the low estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best Estimate: This is 
considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will actually be
 recovered. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities 
recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate. If 
probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50 percent 
probability (P50) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or 
exceed the best estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High Estimate: This is 
considered to be an optimistic estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual remaining 
quantities recovered will exceed the high estimate. If probabilistic 
methods are used, there should be at least a 10 percent probability 
(P10) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the 
high estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certain resource estimate
 volumes disclosed herein are arithmetic sums of multiple estimates of 
DPIIP, which statistical principles indicate may be misleading as to 
volumes that may actually be recovered. Readers should give attention to
 the estimates of individual classes of resources and appreciate the 
differing probabilities of recovery associated with each class as 
explained under this Resource Definitions section.</p>

 ("Pulse" or the "Company") (TSX-V: PUL and PUL.WT) reports today that 
Pulse has initiated Phase 1 of the Bigoray Nisku Pinnacle Reef Enhanced 
Oil Recovery ("EOR") project in the Bigoray area of Alberta ("Bigoray").</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As previously announced on January 9, 2018, and as summarized below, <span class="companylink">Sproule Associates Limited</span>
 ("Sproule"), an independent qualified reserves evaluator, completed an 
independent resource assessment that includes the Bigoray EOR project 
potential only, and is in addition to the previously disclosed baseline 
independently assessed reserves in the Company's core areas at Bigoray 
and Queenstown.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sproule
 assessed a best estimate Discovered Petroleum Initially in-Place (PIIP)
 of 23.292 million barrels of oil ("boe") within Pulse's 100% controlled
 Nisku D and Nisku E Pools, which Pulse views as conservative, given the
 Alberta Regulator lists PIIP as 26.51 million boe's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Resource Assessment was prepared in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 –Standards of Disclosure for Oil and <b>Gas</b> Activities&nbsp;of the Canadian Securities Administrators ("NI 51-101") and the Canadian Oil and <b>Gas</b> Evaluation Handbook ("COGE Handbook").</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more information on the Sproule independent resource assessment, please see "Independent Resource Assessment Details" below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulse also announces the 
appointment of a Bigoray EOR Project Manager, Bill Sawchuk, a 
Professional Petroleum Engineer and an EOR expert to oversee all 
technical and planning aspects of the EOR program. With over 20 years 
of&nbsp;experience as a senior engineering manager and a technical 
expert in reservoir engineering and enhanced oil recovery methods. Bill 
has previously served as an Exploitation Engineer for Anderson 
Exploration Ltd. and <span class="companylink">Devon Canada Corporation</span>
 and most recently, as Manager of Engineering for ARC Resources Ltd. 
where he led teams to optimize production and implement valuable 
Enhanced Oil Recovery projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulse is excited that 
initial critical facility aspects of the Bigoray EOR project are now 
underway, using working capital on hand in preparation for the EOR 
Injection Phase to be implemented in 2018 as planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phase 1 of the EOR 
project ("Phase 1"), which includes re-activation of existing injection 
facilities, will also allow Pulse to cost-effectively reactivate up to 3
 current shut-in oil producers to add approximately 400 BOE/d (100% 
working interest) of new light oil and <b>gas</b> production prior to the EOR project taking place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Cadenhead, President
 and COO of Pulse Oil, commented, "We are eagerly awaiting the Bigoray 
EOR project to be fully underway later this year and the start of Phase 1
 is a very low-cost starting point; it's really exciting for everyone 
involved.&nbsp; This critical facility work not only marks the start of 
the EOR project for us, it allows us to get additional shut-in 
production re-activated in the near-term while we prepare for the water 
injection phase of the project in 2018. This interim production boost 
will provide additional revenues which will be reinvested in the Bigoray
 EOR program later this year as planned."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Independent Resource Assessment Details:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sproule Independent 
Resource Assessment provides estimates categorized as "high", "best" and
 "low" for contingent resources associated with the Bigoray EOR project 
on the two pools, with the unrisked high estimate being 8.07 million boe
 (92.6% Oil), a best estimate of 6.136 million boe (91.3% Oil) and a low
 estimate of 3.668 million boe (89.1% Oil).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, the 
Resource Assessment prepared by Sproule calculated risked contingent 
resources where the risked assessment assigned a 77% chance of Pulse 
proceeding with the EOR project (see Table 2 below) and resulting in a 
best estimate of risked contingent resources net to Pulse of 4.694 
million boe (91.2% Oil).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Cadenhead, President
 and COO of Pulse Oil, commented, "The Sproule Resource Assessment is a 
positive independent commercial confirmation for our Bigoray Nisku 
Enhanced Oil Recovery project. Although this assessment used a more 
conservative approach to Petroleum Initially in-Place ("PIIP") compared 
with the PIIP estimates of the Alberta Energy Regulator, we are excited 
to see that even this more conservative approach resulted in a strong 
endorsement for the project. With an independent un-risked high case 
upside estimated at over 8 million boe's of contingent resources (92% 
oil), the opportunity to move forward with our EOR project to bring on 
stream substantial cashflow while targeting to recover those types of 
oil volumes without drilling a well, creates a substantial opportunity 
to enhance value for Pulse and our shareholders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Resource Assessment 
focussed exclusively on two Nisku pools only in the Bigoray area, and 
included just 2,720 acres of Pulse's 44,720 acre core area holdings 
which includes 14,000 acres at Bigoray alone. Future evaluations may be 
done on Pulse's Mannville, Cardium and Pekisko formations that are 
thought to also provide significant growth opportunities for the Company
 as well as additional Nisku assets/pools held within Pulse's existing 
holdings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cadenhead further 
added, "As part of the Resource Assessment, the evaluator assessed a 
total risk of 77% that the project would proceed, citing economic 
factors and/or timing of development as one of the only risks associated
 with the project. All technical risks such as&nbsp;evaluation drilling,
 regulatory approvals, technology, legal factors, infrastructure and 
markets, political factors and social licence were all assigned 100% 
chance of commerciality.&nbsp;Our goal is to make this project happen in
 2018 and with the oil prices holding firmly above US$60 WTI pricing, 
the economics of this EOR project and return for shareholders continue 
to look more and more attractive alongside improving oil prices." 
&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Resource Assessment 
is based on the results from seventeen wells and, where available, core 
data. Where core was not available, the assessment considered log data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resource 
volumes for these discovered resources have been classified as 
'development unclarified' with Sproule assessing that there is a high 
probability of the Bigoray EOR project becoming a commercial 
development. Pulse will continue to complete project planning associated
 with the project and move forward with its execution plans in 
2018.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Significant positive 
factors relevant to the estimate of Pulse's contingent resources from 
the Bigoray EOR project include success of miscible flood development in
 nearby analogous Nisku reservoirs, a discovered thick oil column 
providing volumes for the deployment of enhanced oil recovery through a 
miscible flood and a nearby infrastructure allowing for access to 
market. Significant negative factors relevant to the estimate of Pulse's
 contingent resources from the Bigoray EOR project include uncertainty 
to how the previously fully waterflooded pools will respond to a 
miscible flood, economic viability uncertainty, as project capital and 
operating costs are unclear and areal uncertainties in the estimation of

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulse is a Canadian 
company incorporated Under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta) and 
has plans to become a leading oil and <b>gas</b> company. Pulse has 
recently completed four transactions to consolidate its interests in the
 Bigoray area of Alberta, resulting in 100% control of Pulse's Bigoray 
operations that include two Nisku oil Pinnacle Reefs. Pulse is moving 
forward to grow production and execute an Enhanced Oil Recovery project 
to unlock significant value for shareholders through control of 
approximately 65 net sections of land across the Mannville, Cardium, 
Pekisko/Shunda and Nisku trends in Western Canada.&nbsp;Pulse will focus
 on acquiring affordable, small to medium sized proven oil and <b>gas</b>
 assets with significant upside. The Company plans to achieve further 
growth through low-risk, technically diligent drilling, infrastructure 
ownership and reserve growth utilizing proven enhanced oil recovery 
techniques and implementation of technology.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resource Definitions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resources encompasses all
 petroleum quantities that originally existed on or within the earth's 
crust in naturally occurring accumulations, including Discovered and 
Undiscovered (recoverable and unrecoverable) plus quantities already 
produced. "Total Resources" is equivalent to "Total Petroleum Initially 
In-Place". Resources are classified in the following categories:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total Petroleum Initially
 In-Place ("TPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is estimated to 
exist originally in naturally occurring accumulations. It includes that 
quantity of petroleum that is estimated, as of a given date, to be 
contained in known accumulations, prior to production, plus those 
estimated quantities in accumulations yet to be discovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovered Petroleum 
Initially In-Place ("DPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is 
estimated, as of a given date, to be contained in known accumulations 
prior to production. The recoverable portion of DPIIP includes 
production, reserves, and Contingent Resources; the remainder is 
unrecoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources are 
those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established 
technology or technology under development but which are not currently 
considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more 
contingencies. Economic Contingent Resources (ECR) are those contingent 
resources that are currently economically recoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undiscovered Petroleum 
Initially In Place ("UPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is 
estimated, on a given date, to be contained in accumulations yet to be 
discovered. The recoverable portion of UPIIP is referred to as 
Prospective Resources and the remainder is unrecoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective Resources are
 those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application 
of future development projects. Prospective Resources have both an 
associated chance of discovery and a chance of development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unrecoverable is that 
portion of DPIIP and UPIIP quantities which is estimated, as of a given 
date, not to be recoverable by future development projects. A portion of
 these quantities may become recoverable in the future as commercial 
circumstances change or technological developments occur; the remaining 
portion may never be recovered due to the physical/chemical constraints 
represented by subsurface interaction of fluids and reservoir rocks. 
Uncertainty Ranges are described by the Canadian Oil and <b>Gas</b> Evaluation Handbook as low, best, and high estimates for reserves and resources as follows:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low Estimate: This is 
considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities
 recovered will exceed the low estimate. If probabilistic methods are 
used, there should be at least a 90 percent probability (P90) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the low estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best Estimate: This is 
considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will actually be
 recovered. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities 
recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate. If 
probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50 percent 
probability (P50) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or 
exceed the best estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High Estimate: This is 
considered to be an optimistic estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual remaining 
quantities recovered will exceed the high estimate. If probabilistic 
methods are used, there should be at least a 10 percent probability 
(P10) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the 
high estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development Unclarified 
is a project maturity sub-class of contingent resources that refers to 
the development plan evaluation is not complete and there is ongoing 
activity to resolve any risks or uncertainties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certain resource estimate
 volumes disclosed herein are arithmetic sums of multiple estimates of 
DPIIP or UPIIP, which statistical principles indicate may be misleading 
as to volumes that may actually be recovered. Readers should give 
attention to the estimates of individual classes of resources and 
appreciate the differing probabilities of recovery associated with each 
class as explained under this&nbsp;Resource Definitions&nbsp;section.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bahar Energy Limited 
(“BEL”) plans to initiate a waterflood of the FS reservoir in Bahar in 
2019 starting with the implementation of five waterflood pilots. 
Assuming a positive reservoir response to the pilot flood, a full-scale 
water injection project would be implemented by BEL. Initially the 
drilling of two down dip injection wells located in the water leg of the
 FS reservoir would be carried out. The drilling of a total of nine 
injection wells is planned over a five-year period from three existing 
platforms and one new platform to be constructed on the western flank of
 the reservoir.</p>

 Notes:
 
 (1)   Contingent Resources are estimates of volumes that are potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established technology or technology under development, but which are not currently considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more contingencies.
 
 (2)   The volumes reported here are “risked” in the sense that they have been adjusted for chance of development. The chance of development is defined as the probability of a project being commercially viable. Quantifying the chance of development requires consideration of both economic contingencies and other contingencies, such as legal, regulatory, market access, political, <b>social license</b>, internal and external approvals and commitment to project finance and development timing. As many of these factors are extremely difficult to quantify, the chance of development is uncertain and must be used with caution. ERCE determined that a 70 percent chance of development is appropriate for the Contingent Resources.
 
 (3)   Gross Contingent Resources are all volumes estimated to be recoverable from the field without any economic cut-off being applied. Gross Weight Interest Contingent Resources is adjusted for the Company’s 80% working interest fraction of the Gross Contingent Resources. Net Contingent Resources are adjusted for the Company’s working interest share after deduction of royalty obligations.
 
 (4)   Project maturity for Contingent Resources has been classified as Development Unclarified.

 Notes:
 
 (1)  The above table has been disclosed consistent with the classification and reporting requirements of PRMS. 
 
 (2)  “Gross Unrisked Prospective Resources” are all volumes estimated to be recoverable from an accumulation. There is no equivalent COGEH definition.
 
 (3)  “Net Unrisked Prospective Resources” are the Company’s working interest fraction of the Gross Unrisked Prospective Resources. The equivalent COGEH definition disclosed below is “Gross Working Interest Prospective Resources” which is the Company’s working interest fraction in Prospective Resources prior to the deduction of royalties. 
 
 (4)  “Net Risked Prospective Resources” are the Company’s working interest fraction of the Net Unrisked Prospective Resources multiplied by the geological chance of success (“COS”).  The COS is an estimate of the probability that drilling the prospect would result in a discovery as defined under PRMS. ERCE has assigned a chance of success of 32% to the Prospective Resources. Under COGEH, prospective resources are risked by a chance of commerciality, being the product of the chance of development and the chance of discovery. For further detail, see below notes (2)-(4) of the table entitled “Prospective Resources, Gum Deniz Miocene Prospect”.
 
 (5)  Prospective Resources reported here are both “unrisked” in that they have not been multiplied by the COS and “risked” in that the volumes have been multiplied by the COS.

 Notes:
 
 (1)   Prospective Resources are estimates of volumes that are potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application of future development projects. 
 
 (2)   The volumes reported here are “risked” in the sense that they have been adjusted for the chance of commerciality, being the product of the chance of development and the chance of discovery. ERCE determined that a 32 percent chance of commerciality is appropriate for the Prospective Resources.
 
 (3)   The chance of development is defined as the probability of a project being commercially viable. Quantifying the chance of development requires consideration of both economic contingencies and other contingencies, such as legal, regulatory, market access, political, <b>social license</b>, internal and external approvals and commitment to project finance and development timing. As many of these factors are extremely difficult to quantify, the chance of development is uncertain and must be used with caution. As many of these factors are extremely difficult to quantify, the chance of development is uncertain and must be used with caution. 
 
 (4)   The chance of discovery is defined as the probability the exploration activities will confirm the existence of a significant accumulation of potentially recoverable resources. Quantifying the chance of discovery requires consideration of certain risks including the chance of success of a play, the chance of success of the prospect specific properties and the prospect specific properties qualities being sufficient to result in a commercially viable discovery. As many of these factors are extremely difficult to quantify, the chance of development is uncertain and must be used with caution.
 
 (5)   Gross Prospective Resources are all of the volumes estimated to be recoverable from the field without any economic cut-off being applied. Gross Weighted Average Prospective Resources is adjusted for the Company’s 80% working interest fraction of the Gross Prospective Resources. Net Prospective Resources are adjusted for the Company’s working interest share after deduction of royalty obligations.

John W. Harkins, President and CEO of Greenfields, stated: “We are 
pleased that this independent analysis affirms the Company’s internal 
interpretation of a major waterflood development opportunity in the 
Fasila horizon in the Bahar field and a significant Miocene exploration 
objective beneath the Gum Deniz Oil field that can be drilled from Gum

place estimates in excess of a hundred million barrel of oil equivalent 
if a discovery is made.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The table and discussion 
below provide a comparison of Greenfields’ operational guidance and 
actual results of production for the year ended December 31, 2017. The 
original guidance was disclosed by the Company in a press release dated

</pre>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reason for Variance</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The primary factors 
contributing to lower than expected production were: (i) the slower pace
 of executing scheduled workovers, reflecting, in part, limited access 
to heavy lift vessels; (ii) the lower than expected post-workover 
production rates; and (iii) the slow pace of south Gum Deniz Electric 
Submersible Pumps (ESP) installations as workovers in old wellbores 
required additional cleaning and scraping runs. The Corporation plans to
 address the limited access to heavy lift vessels through the 
acquisition of a heavier rig that is better suited to deal with the 
challenges imposed by the old wells and difficult workovers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, Bahar 
Energy Operating Company Limited elected to defer both capital and 
operating expenditures until the development plan and reservoir studies 
were completed which would further facilitate the delineation and 
selection of the best projects going forward. The reservoir studies were
 initially expected to be completed by April of 2017, in respect of the <b>gas</b>
 field, and by midyear 2017, in respect of the oil field. However, the 
studies were not completed until Q1 2018 as a result of the 
identification of development opportunities (particularly waterfloods), 
additional evaluation work requested by the reserve auditors (<span class="companylink">GLJ Petroleum Consultants</span>
 and ERCE), and data inconsistencies resulting from scribed logs and 
well files that required clarification and further delineation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In light of lower than 
expected production, the Company revised its 2017 budget, resulting in 
downward adjustments to capital expenditures to $9.7 million (from 
guidance of USD$21 million) and operating expenses to $23 million (from 
guidance of USD$28 million). The deferral of projected expenditures 
intended to increase gross lease production from 4,167 boe/d at December
 31, 2016 resulted in the realization of approximately 24% less revenue 
than originally expected by the Company.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disclosure of Oil and <b>Gas</b> Information</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Information Regarding Disclosure on Oil and <b>Gas</b>
 Resources. The resources data set forth above is based upon an 
independent resource assessment and evaluation prepared by ERCE with an 
effective date of March 2, 2018. The resources were evaluated in 
accordance with the standards contained in the Canadian Oil and <b>Gas</b>
 Evaluation Handbook and the resource definitions contained in NI 
51-101, and consistent with the classification and reporting 
requirements of PRMS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OOIP Disclosure. The term
 original-oil-in-place (“OOIP”) is equivalent to total petroleum 
initially-in-place (“TPIIP”). TPIIP, as defined in the Canadian Oil and <b>Gas</b>
 Evaluation Handbook, is that quantity of petroleum that is estimated to
 exist in naturally occurring accumulations. It includes that quantity 
of petroleum that is estimated, as of a given date, to be contained in 
known accumulations, prior to production, plus those estimated 
quantities in accumulations yet to be discovered. A portion of the TPIIP
 is considered undiscovered and there is no certainty that any portion 
of such undiscovered resources will be discovered. If discovered, there 
is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any 
portion of such undiscovered resources. With respect to the portion of 
the TPIIP that is considered discovered resources, there is no certainty
 that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of such 
discovered resources. A significant portion of the estimated volumes of 
TPIIP will never be recovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOE Disclosure. For the purpose of calculating unit costs, natural <b>gas</b>
 volumes have been converted to a boe using six thousand cubic feet 
equal to one barrel unless otherwise stated. A boe conversion ratio of 
6:1 is based upon an energy equivalency conversion method primarily 
applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency 
at the wellhead. This conversion conforms to NI 51-101. Boe may be 
misleading, particularly if used in isolation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources and 
Prospective Resources. Contingent resources are the quantities of 
petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable 
from known accumulations using established technology or technology 
underdevelopment, but which are not currently considered to be 
commercially recoverable due to one or more contingencies. Contingencies
 are conditions that must be satisfied for a portion of contingent 
resources to be classified as reserves that are: (a) specific to the 
project being evaluated; and (b) expected to be resolved within a 
reasonable timeframe. Contingencies may include factors such as 
economic, legal, environmental, political and regulatory matters or a 
lack of markets. It is also appropriate to classify as contingent 
resources the estimated discovered recoverable quantities associated 
with a project in the early evaluation stage.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective Resources are
 those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application 
of future development projects. Prospective resources have both an 
associated chance of discovery and a chance of development. Not all 
exploration projects will result in discoveries. The chance that an 
exploration project will result in the discovery of petroleum is 
referred to as the chance of discovery. Thus, for an undiscovered 
accumulation the chance of commerciality is the product of two risk 
components-the chance of discovery and the chance of development. There 
is no certainty that any portion of the Prospective Resources will be 
discovered. If discovered, there is no certainty that it will be 
commercially viable to produce any portion of the Prospective Resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estimates of the 
Contingent Resources and Prospective Resources are based upon the report
 prepared by ERCE, the Company’s independent qualified resources 
evaluators, effective as of March 2, 2018. The estimates of Contingent 
Resources and Prospective Resources provided in this press release are 
estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated Contingent 
Resources and Prospective Resources will be recovered. Actual contingent
 and prospective resources may be greater than or less than the 
estimates provided in this in this press release and the differences may
 be material. There is no certainty that any portion of the Prospective 
Resources will be discovered. If discovered, there is no certainty that 
it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the Prospective
 Resources. There is also uncertainty that it will be commercially 
viable to produce any part of the Contingent Resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estimates of contingent 
and prospective resources are by their nature more speculative than 
estimates of proved reserves and would require substantial capital 
spending over a significant number of years to implement recovery. 
Actual locations drilled and quantities that may be ultimately recovered
 from our properties will differ substantially. In addition, we have 
made no commitment to drill, and likely will not drill, all of the 
drilling locations that have been attributable to these quantities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective resources 
estimates that are referred to herein are risked as to both chance of 
discovery and chance of development and both risked and unrisked to the 
COS under PRMS. Contingent resources estimates that are referred to 
herein are both risked and risked as to chance of development. Risks 
that could impact the chance of discovery and chance of development 
include, without limitation: geological uncertainty and uncertainty 
regarding individual well drainage areas; uncertainty regarding the 
consistency of productivity that may be achieved from lands with 
attributed resources; potential delays in development due to product 
prices, access to capital, availability of markets and/or take-away 
capacity; and uncertainty regarding potential flow rates from wells and 
the economics of those wells. Risk assessment is a highly subjective 
process dependent upon the experience and judgment of the evaluators and
 is subject to revision with further data acquisition or interpretation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The following classification of contingent and prospective resources is used in the press release:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Low Estimate (or 1C) 
means there is at least a 90 percent probability (P90) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the low estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Best Estimate (or 2C) 
means there is at least a 50 percent probability (P50) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the best estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* High Estimate (or 3C) 
means there is at least a 10 percent probability (P10) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the high estimate. In
 general, the significant factors that may change the Contingent 
Resources estimates include further delineation drilling, which could 
change the estimates either positively or negatively, future technology 
improvements, which would positively affect the estimates, and 
additional processing capacity that could affect the volumes recoverable
 or type of production. Additional facility design work, development 
plans, and reservoir studies are expected to be completed by Greenfields
 in accordance with its long-term resource development plan.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there's one thing I hope all Albertans can agree on, it's the desperate need for more pipelines to get our abundant oil and <b>gas</b>
 resources to market. According to recent reports, Alberta is losing $7 
billion per year because of lack of pipeline capacity, with industry 
losing $6.7 billion more annually.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While
 we disagree with how the NDP has handled the strategy surrounding the 
Trans Mountain expansion, we don't doubt the need for the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't that long ago 
when pipelines were built in this country with little controversy. Under
 the previous Harper government, four major pipeline projects were 
completed. Keystone, Alberta Clipper, the Line 9 reversal and Anchor 
Loop were all successfully completed under the previous government, 
adding 1.73 million barrels per day of capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, it is true that none
 of these projects were to tidewater, as the NDP is happy to point out. 
But Trans Mountain was not up for government approval under the previous
 Conservative government. The NDP's cousins in Ottawa would no doubt 
have howled with outrage if the Harper government dared to short circuit
 the regulatory process by approving a pipeline before a thorough review
 was completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northern Gateway, the one
 tidewater pipeline up for decision under the Harper Conservatives, was 
indeed approved. Sadly, the project was retroactively cancelled by the 
Trudeau Liberals as part of their plan to ban tanker traffic off B.C.'s 
northern coast (never mind that Alaskan tankers have travelled down that
 route for decades). And the Trudeau Liberals later rigged the approval 
process midstream to scuttle Energy East, another pipeline to tidewater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, radical activists have engaged in a concerted effort to specifically target and sideline Canada's oil and <b>gas</b>
 industry, viewing us as ripe for the picking. Millions of dollars of 
foreign funding have flooded into the Canadian environmental movement 
with the clear goal of starving our resources of markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta NDP government promised that imposing a carbon tax on Albertans would buy so-called <b>social license</b>
 in B.C. for a pipeline to the Pacific. We are baffled that the Alberta 
government bought this specious argument, since it's their fellow 
travellers - both the B.C. NDP and radical environmental activists such 
as Tzeporah Berman - who are leading the fight against the approved 
Trans Mountain expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surely, the Alberta NDP 
understood that their friends would not be willing to trade a carbon tax
 for a pipeline. In fact, Premier Rachel Notley finally acknowledged 
this reality in a recent interview with <span class="companylink">CBC Radio</span>.
 When asked why not put a hold on the carbon tax until the pipeline 
begins construction, she responded, "quite honestly, I don't know that 
B.C. would care one way or another if we did that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The truth is that the 
Trudeau Liberals provided paper regulatory approval for the pipeline, 
purportedly because of Alberta's willingness to impose a carbon tax on 
its citizens. Yet today, the Trudeau Liberals are willing to do little 
beyond rhetoric to fight for Trans Mountain in the face of vociferous 
opposition in B.C., hurting the 51 First Nations that have signed off in
 support of the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's in all Albertans 
interest to see this pipeline succeed. We in the United Conservative 
Party welcome the government's recent about face. After months mocking 
our suggestions to threaten the B.C. NDP with serious consequences, 
including potentially cutting off oil shipments and tolling B.C. natural
 <b>gas</b>, the premier has finally accepted our advice, albeit far too late.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We welcome a robust, 
serious debate on what's needed to get this pipeline built. But we 
should not be deluded into the fantasy that punitive taxes on everyday 
Albertans will appease the fringe yet extremely vocal anti-pipeline 
minority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, we must make it 
clear to the vast majority of reasonable Canadians that the success of 
our energy sector is critical for the success of our country, and that 
Alberta cannot be taken for granted any longer.</p>

Brad Wall Supports Alberta’s Hard Stance On Pipelines, But Not On Carbon Tax</span>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><b>WC</b>&nbsp;</td><td>921 words</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><b>PD</b>&nbsp;</td><td>13 March 2018</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><b>SN</b>&nbsp;</td><td>The Daily Oil Bulletin</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><b>SC</b>&nbsp;</td><td>DOILB</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><b>LA</b>&nbsp;</td><td>English</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><b>CY</b>&nbsp;</td><td>(c)2018 copyright Junewarren-Nickle’s Energy Group.

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While
 they might be ideologically opposed on various issues, right-of-centre 
Brad Wall, former Saskatchewan premier, is in “totally support” of 
left-leaning Alberta Premier Rachel Notley’s promise to do whatever it 
takes to see the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion come to fruition, 
even if it means shutting off the flow of oil and <b>gas</b> to B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That would get a lot of 
attention, as a last resort, if the people in the province of Alberta 
said: ‘Alright, we are going to try and show you just how important 
these pipelines are to you economically, and to the quality of life for 
B.C. and for the rest of the country,’” he told a Calgary Chamber of 
Commerce luncheon event on Monday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Just as a has-been premier, I would cheer from the sidelines if it needs to be done.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, during his 
speech and onstage Q&amp;A session with W.Brett Wilson, Wall also 
emphasized differences he has with Alberta’s NDP government, as well as 
with the current federal Liberal government. The long-time head of the 
conservative <span class="companylink">Saskatchewan Party</span> 
discussed his concerns regarding what he calls the “new left,” which 
seems to place matters such as (what he considers) ineffective carbon 
pricing ahead of government’s primary concern — the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The problem with this 
carbon tax is that you’d be hard pressed to find it working to actually 
reduce emissions, absolutely, where it is implemented. In our own 
country, it has been around since 2008 in the province next door, and 
their emissions are up. Now, B.C. would say: ‘Wait a minute. The 
intensity of the emissions is down.’ But [the Paris Agreement] isn’t 
about intensity of emissions; Paris is about absolute emissions 
reductions.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall’s presentation to 
the chamber was his first public address since leaving office following a
 decade as premier. Earlier this year, the governing party chose Scott 
Moe as Saskatchewan’s new premier (DOB, Jan. 29, 2018).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Wall, 
federal documents suggest the carbon tax must reach $200 per tonne for 
Canada to meet those Paris Agreement targets. While that would reduce 
emissions, he noted, such a price would do so only with widespread 
hardship through such results as many people being unable to afford to 
drive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That’s where the emperor has no clothes. That’s the discussion we need to have.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: “Federally, in 
terms of the economy priorities, we’ve seen a carbon-based budget, we’ve
 seen a gender-based budget, but I long for the day for our country when
 we see an economy-based budget.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall asks: What is <b>social license</b>?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever “<b>social license</b>”
 means, Wall believes the energy sector paid for it long ago, and 
industry does not require a carbon tax to justify its existence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was paid for in the 
transfer payments that were supported because of [Alberta’s] economy and
 ours,” he told reporters following this week’s chamber event. “It was 
paid for in jobs for Canadians from coast to coast to coast, and the 
quality of life implications of that. That’s <b>social license</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It has been paid for in 
meaningful land partnerships with First Nations, who built 
transformational businesses and created jobs because of this sector. All
 of this sounds like <b>social license</b> to me.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall believes this 
“self-immolation of a carbon tax” — whereby Alberta and Saskatchewan 
punish themselves because of their oil and <b>gas</b> assets — is 
ineffective anyway. It will not win support from those who are 
anti-industry, he said, as those individuals will still support ENGOs, 
they will still vote in accordance to their pre-carbon tax views, and 
they will still pressure their governments to act in accordance with 
anti-industry sentiments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If someone from B.C. or some other part of the country doesn’t like the oil and <b>gas</b> sector, the fact you implement a carbon tax is not going to change that person’s opinion.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: “This is something that has frustrated me since the very beginning.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technology to tackle climate change</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Focus on developing 
technology rather than on carbon pricing: That is Wall’s proposed 
‘made-in-Canada’ solution to man-made climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Could we as a country 
have a ‘man-to-the-moon’ sort of approach of finding a way to lower the 
cost of what we are already doing in [Saskatchewan] in terms of clean 
coal technology? That is our experience at home. The technology works; 
we have to drive the costs down. Isn’t it more important to do that and 
perhaps provide a technological solution that would actually reduce 
emissions?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the former 
premier, there are 2,000 coal plants being built around the world, 
principally in Asia, as countries such as India strive to grow their 
economies. He suggested carbon taxation has taken hold in Canada, in 
part, because various sectors of the economy hesitated to point out that
 pricing does not reduce absolute emissions, but it does have an impact 
on jobs. He challenges Canadians to stand up against ineffective policy 
that hurts competitiveness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In our province, it 
wasn’t good enough just to say we weren’t going to have a carbon tax. We
 unveiled in the fall our action plan on climate change, and it is a 
serious plan. It’s meaningful. It includes the possibility of a levy on 
high emitters, the likes of which you have had in Alberta.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">December 31, 2017 Quebec Resource Information</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questerre also reported on the year-end update prepared by <span class="companylink">GLJ Petroleum Consultants Ltd</span>.
 (“GLJ”) to the independent resource assessment of its 735,910 gross 
(190,800 net) acres in the St. Lawrence Lowlands Quebec that have 
potential for the Upper Utica Shale effective December 31, 2017 in a 
report dated March 5, 2018 (the “GLJ Resource Assessment”). The GLJ 
Resource Assessment was prepared in accordance with NI 51-101 and the 
standards contained in the COGE Handbook. The GLJ Resource Assessment 
did not include any of the Corporation’s other properties. All 
anticipated results disclosed herein were prepared by GLJ, which is an 
independent qualified reserves evaluator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GLJ used probabilistic 
methods to generate low, best and high estimates of total petroleum 
initially in-place ("TPIIP"), both discovered and undiscovered. 
Recoverable Contingent and Prospective Resources over Questerre's 
acreage were estimated by analogy and based on available well data over 
the Quebec Utica and public data from US Utica and Marcellus shale 
plays. The evaluation consisted of the Upper Utica which includes the 
Indian Castle and Dolgeville members as well as the Flat Creek. The Flat
 Creek, the lower most member, was only evaluated to estimate 
undiscovered petroleum initially-in-place ("UPIIP"). No recoverable 
resources were assigned to the Flat Creek given the lack of test data 
showing established technology can support commercial development at 
this time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GLJ Resource 
Assessment is based on the results from several vertical and horizontal 
wells on the Questerre’s acreage that have all encountered pay in the 
Utica. Test data from these wells in conjunction with offset development
 and studies of the analogous US Utica supports the prospective 
commercial development of these resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Significant positive factors relevant to the estimate of Questerre’s resources include the importation of all natural <b>gas</b>
 consumed in Quebec creating demand for local production, premium 
realized pricing due to the transportation costs associated with 
importing natural <b>gas</b> for consumption, production test data from 
Questerre’s existing wells and the development of the analogous Utica 
shale in the United States. Significant negative factors include the 
limited number of wells on Questerre’s acreage, lack of a developed 
service sector providing uncertainty regarding estimates of capital and 
operating costs, developing hydrocarbon regulations and environmental 
legislation and the requirement to obtain social acceptability for oil 
and <b>gas</b> operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Questerre believes 
it will have sufficient financial capability to fund its share of costs 
associated with the development program in the GLJ Resource Assessment, 
it may not have access to the necessary capital when required. 
Conducting the development program is also dependent on the 
participation by Questerre’s joint venture partners. There is no 
guarantee that they will elect to participate in the program to the 
extent required. Questerre retains the right to conduct activities 
without the operators’ participation on an independent operations basis 
whereby it can fund 100% of the capital costs for certain well 
operations and facilities in return for net revenue equal to 400% of its
 capital investment before the operators can elect to either remain in a
 penalty position or hold a working interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The TPIIP was determined 
probabilistically on a permit basis with estimates of 45 to 145 Bcf per 
square mile for the Upper Utica. This compares favorably to analogous US
 shale plays with estimates of the Utica in Ohio at between 35 to 85 Bcf
 per square mile and 25 to 150 Bcf per square mile for the Marcellus 
shale in Pennsylvania. Of the TPIIP estimated over Questerre’s acreage, 
only land within a 3 mile radius of a successfully tested well was 
quantified as discovered <b>gas</b>-in-place. Based on this 
qualification only 16% of the total mapped TPIIP in the Upper Utica was 
considered discovered Contingent Resource.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Upper Utica was 
considered undiscovered for approximately 84% of the total mapped TPIIP.
 Recovery factors of 18%, 26% and 37% were applied to the low, best and 
high estimates resource cases respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Summary information 
regarding contingent resources and net present value of future net 
revenues from contingent resources are set forth below and are derived, 
in each case, from the GLJ Resource Assessment. All contingent resources
 evaluated in the GLJ Resource Assessment were deemed economic at the 
effective date of December 31, 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questerre’s average 
working interest in its gross best estimate Contingent Resources is 
25.9%. In addition to Questerre’s working interest, the Company also 
holds a royalty interest in the acreage and associated resources. As a 
result, in some cases Questerre’s net volumes (after royalties) exceed 
its working interest volumes. For clarity, included in the following 
tables are Questerre’s volume before royalties, gross working interest 
volumes and net volumes after royalties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A range of contingent 
resources estimates (low, best and high) were prepared by GLJ. See notes
 5 to 7 of the tables below for a description of low estimate, best 
estimate and high estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GLJ Resources 
Assessment estimated gross risked contingent resources with a project 
maturity subclass of development on hold of 18.6 million boe (low 
estimate) to 50.0 million boe (high estimate), with a best estimate of 
30.4 million boe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GLJ Resources 
Assessment estimated gross risked contingent resources with a project 
maturity subclass of development unclarified of 8.9 million boe (low 
estimate) to 23.8 million boe (high estimate), with a best estimate of 
14.6 million boe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estimate of risked net
 present value of future net revenue of contingent resources is 
preliminary in nature and is provided to assist the reader in reaching 
an opinion on the merit and likelihood of the Company proceeding with 
the required investment. It includes contingent resources that are 
considered too uncertain with respect to the chance of development to be
 classified as reserves. There is uncertainty that the risked net 
present value of future net revenue will be realized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent resources can 
be sub-classified based on their project maturity sub-class which help 
identify a project’s change of commerciality. The project maturity 
subclasses for contingent resources are “development pending”, 
“development on hold”, “development unclarified” or “development not 
viable”, all as defined in the COGE Handbook. “Development pending” is 
when resolution of the final conditions for development is being 
actively pursued (high chance of development). “Development on hold” is 
when there is a reasonable chance of development, but there are major 
non-technical contingencies to be resolved that are usually beyond the 
control of the operator. “Development unclarified” is when the 
evaluation is incomplete and there is ongoing activity to resolve any 
risks or uncertainties. “Development not viable” is when no further data
 acquisition or evaluation is currently planned and hence there is a low
 chance of development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those areas classified as
 development on hold are primarily contingent on the passage of 
applicable hydrocarbon and environmental legislation and regulations as 
well as local acceptability. Remaining areas classified as development 
unclarified have additional contingency or risk associated with securing
 <b>social license</b> to operate and are thereby a lower priority for 
development. Additional contingencies include firm development plans, 
detailed cost estimates and corporate approvals and sanctioning. There 
is no certainty that any portion of the Contingent Resources will be 
economic to develop. Though pilot horizontal development plans have been
 proposed, the project evaluation scenario for the Contingent Resources 
is not sufficiently defined to make an investment decision to proceed to
 development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources are 
evaluated based on the same fiscal conditions used in the assessment of 
reserves, and as such, are forecasted to be economic. Contingent 
Resource values are estimated on the basis of established technology, 
namely multistage hydraulic fracturing recovery technologies that are 
widely used in the development of shale <b>gas</b> plays including in the Montney in Canada and the Utica formation in Ohio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chance of 
commerciality for Contingent Resources is equal to the product of the 
chance of discovery and the chance of development. “Chance of discovery”
 is the estimated probability that exploration activities will confirm 
the existence of a significant accumulation of potentially recoverable 
petroleum. “Chance of development” is the estimated probability that, 
once discovered, a known accumulation will be commercially developed. 
Based on contingencies related to the passage of applicable hydrocarbon 
and environmental legislation, regulations, local acceptability, and 
additional risk associated with securing <b>social license</b> to 
operate, firm development plans, detailed cost estimates and corporate 
approvals GLJ estimated the Chance of Development for the development 
unclarified subclass ranges between 10% and 25% as detailed in the table
 below. By definition the chance of discovery for Contingent Resource is
 100%. The corresponding chance of commerciality for the development 
unclarified subclass is therefore estimated at between 10% and 25% as 
detailed in the table below.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notes:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Contingent resources 
are defined in the COGE Handbook as those quantities of petroleum 
estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from known 
accumulations using established technology or technology under 
development, but which are not currently considered to be commercially 
recoverable due to one or more contingencies. There is no certainty that
 it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the contingent
 resources or that Questerre will produce any portion of the volumes 
currently classified as contingent resources. The estimates of 
contingent resources involve implied assessment, based on certain 
estimates and assumptions, that the resources described exists in the 
quantities predicted or estimated, as at a given date, and that the 
resources can be profitably produced in the future. The risked net 
present value of the future net revenue from the contingent resources 
does not represent the fair market value of the contingent resources. 
Actual contingent resources (and any volumes that may be reclassified as
 reserves) and future production therefrom may be greater than or less 
than the estimates provided herein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* GLJ prepared the 
estimates of contingent resources shown for each property using 
deterministic principles and methods. Probabilistic aggregation of the 
low and high property estimates shown in the table might produce 
different total volumes than the arithmetic sums shown in the table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* "Gross” contingent 
resources are Questerre's working interest (operating or non-operating) 
share before deduction of royalties and without including any royalty 
interests of Questerre. "Net” contingent resources are Questerre's 
working interest (operating or non-operating) share after deduction of 
royalty obligations, plus Questerre's royalty interests in contingent 
resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The risked net present 
value of future net revenue attributable to the contingent resources 
does not represent the fair market value of the contingent resources. 
Estimated abandonment and reclamation costs have been included in the 
evaluation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Low Estimate Contingent
 Resources are considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity 
that will actually be recovered. It is likely that the actual remaining 
quantities recovered will exceed the low estimate. If probabilistic 
methods are used, there should be at least a 90 percent probability 
(P90) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the 
low estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Best Estimate 
Contingent Resources are considered to be the best estimate of the 
quantity that will actually be recovered. It is equally likely that the 
actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the 
best estimate. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at 
least a 50 percent probability (P50) that the quantities actually 
recovered will equal or exceed the best estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* High Estimate 
Contingent Resources are considered to be an optimistic estimate of the 
quantity that will actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual
 remaining quantities recovered will exceed the high estimate. If 
probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 10 percent 
probability (P10) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or 
exceed the high estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Chance of 
Development (CoDev) is the estimated probability that, once discovered, a
 known accumulation will be commercially developed. Five factors have 
been considered in determining the CoDev as follows:CoDev = Ps (Economic
 Factor) × Ps (Technology Factor) × Ps (Development Plan Factor) ×Ps 
(Development Timeframe Factor) × Ps (Other Contingency Factor) wherein 
Ps is the probability of successEconomic Factor – For reserves to be 
assessed, a project must be economic. With respect to contingent 
resources, this factor captures uncertainty in the assessment of 
economic status principally due to uncertainty in cost estimates and 
marketing options. Economic viability uncertainty due to technology is 
more aptly captured with the Technology Factor. The Economic Factor will
 be 1 for reserves and will often be 1 for development pending projects 
and for projects with a development study or pre-development study with a
 robust rate of return. A robust rate of return means that the project 
retains economic status with variation in costs and/or marketing plans 
over the expected range of outcomes for these variables.Technology 
Factor - For reserves to be assessed, a project must utilize established
 technology. With respect to contingent resources, this factor captures 
the uncertainty in the viability of the proposed technology for the 
subject reservoir, namely, the uncertainty associated with technology 
under development. By definition, technology under development is a 
recovery process or process improvement that has been determined to be 
technically viable via field test and is being field tested further to 
determine its economic viability in the subject reservoir. The 
Technology Factor will be 1 for reserves and for established technology.
 For technology under development, this factor will consider different 
risks associated with technologies being developed at the scale of the 
well versus the scale of a project and technologies which are being 
modified or extended for the subject reservoir versus new emerging 
technologies which have not previously been applied in any commercial 
application. The risk assessment will also consider the quality and 
sufficiency of the test data available, the ability to reliably scale 
such data and the ability to extrapolate results in time.Development 
Plan Factor – For reserves to be assessed, a project must have a 
detailed development plan. With respect to contingent resources, this 
factor captures the uncertainty in the project evaluation scenario. The 
Development Plan Factor will be 1 for reserves and high, approaching 1, 
for development pending projects. This factor will consider development 
plan detail variations including the degree of delineation, reservoir 
specific development and operating strategy detail (technology decision,
 well layouts (spacing and pad locations), completion strategy, start-up
 strategy, water source and disposal, other infrastructure, facility 
design, marketing plans etc) and the quality of the cost estimates as 
provided by the developer.Development Timeframe Factor – In the case of 
major projects, for reserves to be assessed, first major capital 
spending must be initiated within 5 years of the effective date. The 
Development Timeframe Factor will be 1 for reserves and will often be 1 
for development pending projects provided the project is planned 
on-stream based on the same criteria used in the assessment of reserves.
 With respect to contingent resources, the factor will approach 1 for 
projects planned on-stream with a timeframe slightly longer than the 
limiting reserves criteria.Other Contingency Factor – For reserves to be
 assessed, all contingencies must be eliminated. With respect to 
contingent resources, this factor captures major contingencies, usually 
beyond the control of the operator, other than those captured by 
economic status, technology status, project evaluation scenario status 
and the development timeframe. The Other Contingency Factor will be 1 
for reserves and for development pending projects and less than 1 for on
 hold. Provided all contingencies have been identified and their 
resolution is reasonably certain, this factor would also be 1 for 
development unclarified projects.These factors may be inter-related 
(dependent) and care has been taken to ensure that risks are 
appropriately accounted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Contingent resources 
for the Lowlands have been estimated based the results from several 
vertical and horizontal wells on the Company’s acreage that have all 
encountered pay in the Utica. Test data from these wells in conjunction 
with offset development and studies of analogous US Utica supports the 
prospective commercial development on these resources. The estimated 
unrisked cost to bring these contingent resources on commercial 
production is $809.28 million and the expected timeline is between 2 and
 11 years. The specific contingencies for these resources are the 
passage of applicable hydrocarbon and environmental legislation, 
regulations, local acceptability, firm development plans, detailed cost 
estimates and corporate approvals and sanctioning.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Summary information 
regarding prospective resources and net present value of future net 
revenues from prospective resources are set forth below and are derived,
 in each case, from the GLJ Resources Assessment. The GLJ Resources 
Assessment was prepared in accordance with COGE Handbook and NI-51-101 
by GLJ, an independent qualified reserve evaluator. All prospective 
resources evaluated in the GLJ Resources Assessment were deemed economic
 at the effective date of December 31, 2017. Prospective resources are 
in addition to reserves estimated in the GLJ Report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Upper Utica was 
considered undiscovered for approximately 84% of the total mapped TPIIP.
 Recovery factors of 19%, 27% and 40% were applied to the low, best and 
high estimates resource cases respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A range of prospective 
resources estimates (low, best and high) were prepared by GLJ. See notes
 6 to 8 of the tables below for a description of low estimate, best 
estimate and high estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GLJ Resources 
Assessment estimated gross risked prospective resources of 87 million 
boe (low estimate) to 238 million boe (high estimate), with a best 
estimate of 143 million boe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chance of 
commerciality for Prospective Resources is equal to the product of the 
chance of discovery and the chance of development. “Chance of discovery”
 is the estimated probability that exploration activities will confirm 
the existence of a significant accumulation of potentially recoverable 
petroleum. “Chance of development” is the estimated probability that, 
once discovered, a known accumulation will be commercially developed. 
Based on contingencies related to the passage of applicable hydrocarbon 
and environmental legislation, regulations, local acceptability, and 
additional risk associated with securing <b>social license</b> to 
operate, firm development plans, detailed cost estimates and corporate 
approvals GLJ estimated the Chance of Development at 19 percent. 
Proximity to extensional and compressional-related fault systems 
presents risk of structuring resulting in leak off and reduced pressures
 in some prospective regions, additionally, lack of delineation data 
provides reservoir risk associated with uncertainty regarding reservoir 
quality and rock mechanics amicable to hydraulic fracturing. Therefore, 
GLJ has estimated the Chance of Discovery at 81 percent. The 
corresponding chance of commerciality is 15 percent. This also takes 
into account Questerre’s working interest and operatorship of its assets
 as Questerre is subject to the priorities of working interest partners 
for such assets. Production and development forecasts were not completed
 by GLJ as part of the prospective resources evaluation.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notes:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Prospective resources 
are defined in the COGE Handbook as those quantities of petroleum 
estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from 
unknown accumulations by application of future development projects. 
Prospective resources have both an associated chance of discovery 
(CoDis) and a chance of development (CoDev). There is no certainty that 
any portion of the prospective resources will be discovered. If 
discovered, there is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to
 produce any portion of the prospective resources or that Questerre will
 produce any portion of the volumes currently classified as prospective 
resources. The estimates of prospective resources involve implied 
assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the 
resources described exists in the quantities predicted or estimated, as 
at a given date, and that the resources can be profitably produced in 
the future. The risked net present value of the future net revenue from 
the prospective resources does not represent the fair market value of 
the prospective resources. Actual prospective resources (and any volumes
 that may be reclassified as reserves) and future production therefrom 
may be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* GLJ prepared the 
estimates of prospective resources shown for each property using 
deterministic principles and methods. Probabilistic aggregation of the 
low and high property estimates shown in the table might produce 
different total volumes than the arithmetic sums shown in the table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The forecast price and 
cost assumptions utilized in the year-end 2017 reserves report were also
 utilized by GLJ in preparing the GLJ Resource Assessmen</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* "Gross” prospective 
resources are Questerre’s working interest (operating or non-operating) 
share before deduction of royalties and without including any royalty 
interests of the Company. "Net” prospective resources are Questerre’s 
working interest (operating or non-operating) share after deduction of 
royalty obligations, plus Questerre’s royalty interests in prospective 
resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The risked net present 
value of future net revenue attributable to the prospective resources 
does not represent the fair market value of the prospective resources. 
Estimated abandonment and reclamation costs have been included in the 
evaluation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Low Estimate 
Prospective Resources is considered to be a conservative estimate of the
 quantity that will actually be recovered. It is likely that the actual 
net remaining quantities recovered will exceed the low estimate of 87 
million boe. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least
 a 90 percent probability (P90) that the quantities actually recovered 
will equal or exceed the low estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Best Estimate 
Prospective Resources is considered to be the best estimate of the 
quantity that will actually be recovered. It is equally likely that the 
actual net remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than 
the best estimate of 143 million. If probabilistic methods are used, 
there should be at least a 50 percent probability (P50) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the best estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The High Estimate 
Prospective Resources is considered to be an optimistic estimate of the 
quantity that will actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual
 net remaining quantities recovered will exceed the high estimate of 238
 million boe. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at 
least a 10 percent probability (P10) that the quantities actually 
recovered will equal or exceed the high estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The chance of 
commerciality is defined as the product of the chance of discovery and 
the chance of development. Chance of discovery is defined in COGE 
Handbook as the estimated probability that exploration activities will 
confirm the existence of a significant accumulation of potentially 
recoverable petroleum. Chance of development is defined as the estimated
 probability that, once discovered, a known accumulation will be 
commercially developed <span class="companylink">Questerre Energy Corporation</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All evaluations and 
reviews of future net revenue are stated prior to any provision for 
interest costs or general and administrative costs and after the 
deduction of estimated future capital expenditures for wells to which 
reserves have been assigned. The estimated future net revenue from the 
production of disclosed oil and <b>gas</b> reserves does not represent 
the fair market value of the Company’s reserves. There is no assurance 
that such price and cost assumptions will be attained and variances 
could be material. The recovery and reserve estimates of crude oil, NGLs
 and natural <b>gas</b> reserves provided herein are estimates only and 
there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered. 
Actual light and medium crude oil, shale <b>gas</b> and natural <b>gas</b>
 liquids reserves may be greater than or less than the estimates 
provided herein. All of the Company’s light and medium crude oil, shale <b>gas</b> and natural <b>gas</b> liquids reserves are located in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barrel of oil equivalent 
(“boe”) amounts may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A 
boe conversion ratio has been calculated using a conversion rate of six 
thousand cubic feet of natural <b>gas</b> to one barrel of oil and the 
conversion ratio of one barrel to six thousand cubic feet is based on an
 energy equivalent conversion method application at the burner tip and 
does not necessarily represent an economic value equivalent at the 
wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude
 oil as compared to natural <b>gas</b> is significantly different from 
the energy equivalent of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may 
be misleading as an indication of value.</p>

 (“Questerre” or the “Company”) (TSX:QEC) (OSE:QEC) announced today that
 it has entered into an agreement with an experienced operator to 
develop its 100% acreage in the Kakwa area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, President and Chief Executive Officer of Questerre, 
commented, “The first well at Kakwa North should spud next quarter, 
subject to rig availability. Given the strong condensate production and 
low sour content from nearby wells on our joint venture acreage we are 
looking forward to the results.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He further added, “With 
this joint venture we are developing our operated acreage and preserving
 capital primarily for Quebec. We are working on our Quebec Clean <b>Gas</b> pilot as we wait for the release of the final regulations later this spring.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The farm-in partner is an
 exploration and production company with extensive operating experience 
with the Montney Formation in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subject to the terms of 
the agreement, the farm-in partner has the right to drill, complete, 
equip and tie-in two horizontal wells targeting the Montney Formation to
 earn a 50% interest in certain acreage held by Questerre at Kakwa 
North. The partner has the option to drill, complete, equip and tie-in 
additional wells to earn a similar interest in other acreage held by 
Questerre at Kakwa North and Kakwa South. Questerre will hold a royalty 
interest in these initial wells and certain subsequent wells subject to 
standard payout provisions. Questerre currently holds a 100% interest in
 4,480 acres at Kakwa North along with 3,840 acres at Kakwa South and a 
25% interest in 10,240 acres on its joint venture block.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questerre also reported 
on plans for additional activity targeting its shallow mineral rights, 
above and excluding Montney rights, at Kakwa North. The Company was 
recently advised by the operator that it plans to drill up to six 
horizontal wells on this acreage in 2018. Questerre holds an overriding 
royalty interest in 4160 acres of shallow rights at Kakwa North.</p>

 so let me see if I've got this right: After three years of raising 
taxes on oil companies and everyone who works in the patch (plus just 
about everyone else in Alberta), after the carbon tax, a 50% increase in
 the tax on large industrial emitters, the coal shutdown, the hard cap 
on oilsands emissions and a pile of other red tape and regulations on 
the oil industry, the Notley government announces $1 billion in grants 
and loans guarantees for bitumen upgraders and we're all supposed to be 
blown away by their commitment to Alberta's energy industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By modest estimates, Alberta has lost between $30 billion to $35 billion in oil and <b>gas</b>
 investment since the NDP nightmare began in May 2015, and now the

take our oil to international markets - neither of which is the fault of
 the NDP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's not as if we are losing out to developing countries in the investment race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We certainly are losing out to places such Egypt and Kazakhstan and Tanzania.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But mostly we are losing 
out to jurisdictions that are the most like Alberta: Texas, Oklahoma, 
North Dakota. We are losing out to places where the geology and the 
financial landscapes are similar to Alberta. Often in the past, when 
they've boomed we've boomed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we are being passed 
by now, while they surge ahead, in large part because our New Democrats 
have been operating under the ridiculous belief that if we could just 
beggar ourselves with environmental regulations and taxes, we could buy "<b>social license</b>" that would cause "green" politicians and environmentalists to grant us permits to build pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And after that strategy 
has turned out to be such a spectacular failure, the NDP think Albertans
 can be bought off with an investment of $125 million a year for eight 
years to "diversify" our oil and <b>gas</b> sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industrial goal of 
the Notley government's diversification strategy, released Monday is 
sound. Indeed, it's clever and practical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Get a few upgraders built
 that don't fully refine oilsands bitumen, but rather upgrade it part 
way. That reduces the need to add diluent to the bitumen, which means 
more bitumen can fit down a pipeline and there is no need to remove 
diluent at the other end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP also want to see more liquification of natural <b>gas</b> done in Alberta so our methane and other gases can be shipped more easily to west coast terminals. That's all very sensible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the NDP hadn't 
sucked (taxed) so much money out of the patch already (not to mention 
discouraging so much investment and destroying so many jobs), maybe they
 wouldn't have to put back a billion dollars they don't have, just to 
try to stimulate some "diversification."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We should do some 
valueadded processing of our natural resources here, rather than always 
shipping our raw resources down a pipeline to be refined and turned into
 usable products somewhere else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was always 
shortsighted of former Tory governments not to get more refineries and 
upgraders built when the price of oil was high and environmental 
opposition was low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Give the NDP credit for 
taking a step in that direction. But maybe they won't have to spend tax 
dollars trying to force upgraders into existence if they hadn't 
undermined the energy sector so thoroughly in the first place.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City
 officials dropped a bombshell on the community of Coniston earlier this
 month when, through a press release, Mayor Brian Bigger announced that 
Greater Sudbury had selected the small community as the preferred 
location for <span class="companylink">Noront Resources</span>'ferrochrome smelter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost immediately, 
officials were scrambling to provide information to stunned 
Conistonians. Coun. Deb McIntosh, whose ward includes Coniston, hastily 
arranged a public meeting for the following week. Mayor Bigger, fresh 
from his tour of the <span class="companylink">Outokumpu</span> 
ferrochrome facility in Finland, did the rounds with local media to 
assure the public that there is nothing to worry about when it comes to 
ferrochrome.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It all looked and sounded like damage control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost overnight, 
Conistonians, fearful of the impacts that a new smelter will have on 
their community, were provoked into action. A website was registered - 
www.saveconiston.ca[http://www.saveconiston.ca] - and content about the 
potentially harmful effects of chromite processing was being shared 
around the community via social media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the public meeting - 
the first where the city shared information directly with the impacted 
community - residents were demanding answers about chemical reactions 
and impacts related to trivalent and hexavalent chromium emissions. They
 also wanted to know how their community could have been selected by the
 city as the site for a massive new piece of industrial infrastructure 
without anyone from the city first asking residents for their opinions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents didn't trust 
the answers they received from municipal officials about industrial 
processes and the production of carcinogenic hexavalent chromium. And no
 answers at all were offered with regards to a lack of public 
consultation and community engagement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It didn't have to be this way, of course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this council has developed a nasty habit of making decisions first, and consulting with the public later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news for 
Conistonians opposed to the project may be that Noront hasn't yet made a
 decision regarding which northern municipality will play host to 
Ontario's first ferrochrome production facility. Greater Sudbury, 
Timmins, Sault Ste. Marie and Thunder Bay are all angling for Noront's 
prize: 350 full-time jobs and a $1 billion facility that will see 
chromite ore from the Ring of Fire turned into ferrochrome, an important
 product used to make stainless steel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Partnerships between 
governments and business interests that exclude citizen participation 
and engagement in decision-making processes are the old way of doing 
business. Today, citizens everywhere are finding their voices and are 
demanding active involvement in decision-making. And citizens are 
telling decision makers that they have the right to withhold their 
consent from development projects that threaten the health and 
well-being of their communities and the natural environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's called a <b>social license</b>
 - and while there is no legal requirement for decision-makers to obtain
 community consent, neglecting to do so can lead to delay and project 
abandonment as we have seen with natural <b>gas</b> and bitumen pipeline proposals elsewhere in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it stands now, with local opposition forming in reaction to citizens being kept in the dark by the city, there is no <b>social license</b>
 from the Coniston community to support Greater Sudbury's bid. 
Conistonians are telling Noront that a smelter is not wanted here, and 
pursuit of the facility will be opposed vigorously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Had the city made an 
effort to involve residents in the site selection process prior to 
submitting a bid, city officials could have worked together with 
residents and other stakeholders towards building a favourable consensus
 for the project - something that Noront would surely count in Greater 
Sudbury's favour. Instead, by keeping everyone in the dark, an 
opportunity to do business differently was lost - and ultimately the 
city's selection by Noront to host a new ferrochrome smelter might be 
lost along with it. Steve May is a member of the Green Party in Sudbury.</p>

Mr. Chris Bruijnzeels reports</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHAMARAN ANNOUNCES 25% INCREASE IN ATRUSH RESERVES ESTIMATES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Shamaran Petroleum Corp</span>. has increased 
by 25 per cent its estimated proven plus probable (2P) oil reserves for 
the Atrush block as of Dec. 31, 2017, after accounting for Atrush 2017 
production. Reserves and contingent resources estimates were provided by
 <span class="companylink">McDaniel &amp; Associates Consultants Ltd</span>.
 ("McDaniel"), the Company's independent qualified resources evaluator, 
and were prepared in accordance with standards set out in the Canadian 
National Instrument NI 51-101 and Canadian Oil and <b>Gas</b> Evaluation Handbook (COGEH).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Chris Bruijnzeels, President and CEO of ShaMaran, commented: "These 
year-end reserve estimates demonstrate the world class nature of the 
Atrush field. Total Field Proven plus Probable ("2P") Reserves on a 
property gross basis for Atrush increased from 85.1 MMbbl to 102.7 MMbbl
 which, when 2017 Atrush production of 3.4 MMbbl is included, represents
 an increase of 25 percent. Total Field Unrisked Best Estimate 
Contingent Oil Resources ("2C") on a property gross basis for Atrush 
remained essentially the same at around 296 MMbbl, resulting in an 
overall increase in Atrush best estimate resources of 5%. Our 2018 work 
program aims to move more of the contingent resources into reserves."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McDaniel's estimates 
reflect the encouraging production results from the Atrush field 
following start of production in July 2017, as well as the positive 
drilling results of Chiya Khere-7 well which found the top of the 
reservoir 114 meters higher to prognosis. McDaniel's reserves estimates 
assume that four extra production wells will be drilled to further 
develop the medium gravity oil in the reserves area of the field,

Notes: 
(1)Based on a 20.1 percent Company working interest share of the property gross resources.
(2)There is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the resources.
(3)The Atrush Field contains crude oil of variable density. Fluid type is classified according to
   COGEH: Light/Medium Oil is based on density less than 920 kg/m3 and Heavy Oil is between 920 and
   1000 kg/m3.
(4)These are unrisked contingent resources that do not account for the chance of development which
   is defined as the probability of a project being commercially viable. Quantifying the chance of
   development requires consideration of both economic contingencies and other contingencies, such
   as legal, regulatory, market access, political, <b>social license</b>, internal and external approvals
   and commitment to project finance and development timing. As many of these factors are extremely
   difficult to quantify, the chance of development is uncertain and must be used with caution. The
   chance of development was estimated to be 80 percent for the Crude Oil and 5 percent for the
   Natural <b>Gas</b>.
(5)The contingent resources are sub-classified as "development unclarified" with an "undetermined"
   economic status.

Chris Bruijnzeels, President and CEO of ShaMaran, commented: "These 
year-end reserve estimates demonstrate the world class nature of the 
Atrush field.&nbsp;Total Field Proven plus Probable ("2P") Reserves on a
 property gross basis for Atrush increased from 85.1 MMbbl to 102.7 
MMbbl which, when 2017 Atrush production of 3.4 MMbbl is included, 
represents an increase of 25 percent. Total Field Unrisked Best Estimate
 Contingent Oil Resources ("2C") on a property gross basis for Atrush 
remained essentially the same at around 296 MMbbl, resulting in an 
overall increase in Atrush best estimate resources of 5%. Our 2018 work 
program aims to move more of the contingent resources into reserves."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McDaniel's estimates 
reflect the encouraging production results from the Atrush field 
following start of production in July 2017, as well as the positive 
drilling results of Chiya Khere-7 well which found the top of the 
reservoir 114 meters higher to prognosis. McDaniel's reserves estimates 
assume that four extra production wells will be drilled to further 
develop the medium gravity oil in the reserves area of the field, 
increasing medium oil recovery. Reserves associated with the heavy oil 
extended well test planned in 2018 for the Chiya Khere-6 well have also 
been included. Reserves which were included in McDaniel's previous

("Sherritt" or the "Corporation") (TSX: S), a world leader in the mining
 and hydrometallurgical refining of nickel and cobalt from lateritic 
ores, today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and 
year ended December 31, 2017. All amounts are in Canadian currency 
unless noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CEO COMMENTARY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sherritt ended 2017 with
 a significantly strengthened balance sheet and a much improved outlook 
as a result of a number of key developments over the past year," said 
David Pathe, President and CEO of Sherritt International. "Most notably,
 we completed the restructuring of the Ambatovy Joint Venture, achieved 
our nickel and cobalt production as well as our unit cost targets at the
 Moa Joint Venture, and benefitted from higher realized prices for each 
of the primary commodities that we produce."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pathe added, "We have
 sustained this momentum since the start of 2018 with our first equity 
financing in more than a decade, and are currently conducting a modified
 Dutch auction tender process to reduce our debt even further. With the 
strong outlook for Class 1 nickel and cobalt given electric vehicle 
market trends and the maturities on our outstanding debentures not due 
until the fourth quarter of 2021, we are particularly encouraged by our 
prospects in 2018 and beyond."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q4 HIGHLIGHTS </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">   -- Sherritt and its partners successfully completed the restructuring of the 
      Ambatovy Joint Venture. Following the restructuring, Sherritt eliminated 
      $1.4 billion in debt from its balance sheet, retained a 12% ownership 
      interest in Ambatovy and continues to serve as operator. 
 
   -- Net direct cash cost (NDCC)(1) at the Moa Joint Venture ("Moa JV") was 
      US$1.80 per pound of finished nickel sold, the lowest total since the 
      third quarter of 2004. The decline was primarily driven by higher cobalt 
      prices and the US$0.50 per pound cost savings achieved with the 
      commissioning of the third acid plant at Moa in the fourth quarter of 
      2016. 
 
   -- Sherritt's share of finished nickel production at the Moa JV was 4,134 
      tonnes, up 9% from Q4 2016, while its share of finished cobalt was 465 
      tonnes, up 22% from Q4 2016. Production increased on a year-over-year 
      basis despite the negative impact heavy rains had on lowering mixed 
      sulphide production in November and December 2017. 
 
   -- Received $19.9 million from the Moa JV as repayment on its working 
      capital facility and US$7.5 million in Cuban energy payments. 
 
   -- Adjusted EBITDA was $49.6 million, up 33% from Q4 2016. 
 
   -- Including a gain of $629.0 million related to the Ambatovy restructuring, 
      earnings were $537.8 million, or $1.80 per share outstanding, up from a 
      net loss of $106.7 million, or $0.36 per share outstanding, in Q4 2016. </pre>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2017 HIGHLIGHTS </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">   -- Sherritt ended the year with cash, cash equivalents and short-term 
      investments of $203.0 million after reflecting payments related to the 
      Ambatovy JV restructuring, interest payments related to outstanding 
      debentures and the $35.0 million repayment of a syndicated revolving-term 
      loan. 
 
   -- Sherritt's share of finished nickel and finished cobalt production at the 
      Moa JV were 15,762 tonnes and 1,801 tonnes, respectively. The production 
      totals were in line with guidance for the year. 
 
   -- NDCC at the Moa Joint Venture was US$2.35 per pound of finished nickel, 
      below the US$2.80 - $3.30 per pound guidance that the Company provided 
      for the year. 
 
   -- Adjusted EBITDA was $149.8 million, up from $40.0 million in 2016. 
 
   -- Including the gain related to the Ambatovy JV restructuring, net earnings 
      were $293.8 million, or $0.99 per share outstanding, up from a net loss 
      of $378.9 million, or $1.29 per share outstanding, in 2016. 
 
   -- Sherritt's efforts to strengthen its balance sheet were reflected in a 
      number of improved financial ratios at year end. Net debt to Adjusted 
      EBITDA reduced from 48.9 at the end 2016 to 4.4 at December 31, 2017 
      while total debt to shareholders' equity improved from 2.1 at the end of 
      2016 to 0.8 at December 31, 2017.(2) </pre>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HIGHLIGHTS SUBSEQUENT TO YEAR END </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">   -- Closed a unit offering financing transaction that generated gross 
      proceeds of $132.0 million. Net proceeds will be used to reduce 
      Sherritt's outstanding indebtedness, for general corporate purposes and 
      to fund future growth initiatives. 
 
   -- Launched a modified Dutch Auction tender offer to repurchase up to $75.0 
      million of outstanding unsecured debentures. The tender offering is 
      expected to close on February 16, 2017. 
 
   -- Executed a three-year extension of the Puerto Escondido/Yumuri production 
      sharing contract to 2021. 
 
   -- Although facilities at the Ambatovy Joint Venture in Madagascar were 
      impacted by Tropical Cyclone Ava, a Category 2 hurricane equivalent storm, 
      all personnel were unhurt and safely accounted for. Damage to equipment 
      and the acid production facilities resulted in a temporary halt in 
      production. Repairs have since been completed and partial production has 
      resumed. A ramp up in production is expected through the end of Q2 2018. </pre>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(2) Net debt is defined 
as debt due within one year plus the book value of long-term debt, less 
cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, as shown in 
Sherritt's consolidated statement of financial position. Total debt is 
defined as debt due within one year plus the book value of long-term 
debt plus the non-recourse debt. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Q4 2017, Sherritt 
generated negative cash flow from operations of $33.9 million. The 
consolidated total included $32.5 million in positive cash flow 
contributions from the Moa JV and Fort Site and $5.4 million in positive
 cash flow contributions from the Power division. Total transaction 
costs of $11.3 million related to the restructuring of the Ambatovy JV 
contributed negatively to the consolidated total.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash, cash equivalents 
and short-term investments at year end were $203.0 million, down from 
$290.3 million at September 30, 2017. The decrease was primarily driven 
by payments related to the restructuring of the Ambatovy JV, lower Cuban
 energy payments received and the repayment of $8.0 million in Q4 on the
 Company's syndicated revolving-term loan and partly offset by a $19.9 
million repayment from the Moa JV on its working capital facility to 
Sherritt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During Q4, US$7.5 million
 of Cuban energy payments were received compared to US$32.6 million in 
the third quarter of 2017. Total Cuban overdue receivables were US$132.6
 million at December 31, 2017 compared to US$100.5 million at September 
30, 2017. The increase in overdue receivables was attributable to a 
number of factors, including the impact of Hurricane Irma and resulting 
recovery costs on Cuba's economy. Sherritt has experienced variability 
in its Cuban receivables over the years but has not incurred any losses 
related to any Cuban receivables.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">METAL MARKETS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nickel</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nickel prices rallied in 
the second half of 2017 after experiencing considerable volatility in 
the first six months of the year. The average nickel reference price in 
the fourth quarter was US$5.25 per pound, up 7% from US$4.90 for Q4 
2016. The average nickel reference price for the 12-months of 2017 was 
US$4.72 per pound, up 8% from US$4.36 per pound for 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year-over-year price 
improvements were largely driven by the growing understanding of the 
important role that Class 1 nickel will play in the burgeoning electric 
vehicle (EV) market. Class 1 nickel, along with cobalt, are key elements
 needed to manufacture EV batteries. Demand for Class 1 nickel and 
cobalt are expected to grow significantly beginning in 2019 when China 
expects to begin production quotas requiring that 10% of all vehicles 
manufactured be electric.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During Q4, the nickel 
price was supported by news that nickel pig iron (NPI) producers in 
China were asked to reduce production to alleviate pollution with 
China's largest NPI-only producer ordered to halve production from 
November 2017 to March 2018. Actual and anticipated reductions from 
existing nickel producers also continued to help underpin the nickel 
price, with nickel supply expected to be in a deficit for 2018 and 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nickel reference price improvements in the second half were also driven by the decline in inventories. Combined <span class="companylink">LME</span>
 and SHFE nickel inventories at year-end declined to 410,828 tonnes 
(from 464,696 tonnes at the beginning of the year). Any further decline 
in visible inventories could give momentum to nickel price increases in 
the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cobalt</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cobalt prices 
strengthened considerably in 2017. The average reference price in the 
fourth quarter was US$31.60 per pound for 2017, up 134% from Q4 2016. 
The average reference cobalt price for the 12-month period of 2017 was 
US$26.53, up 125% from US$11.77 per pound for 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price increase is 
primarily linked to the growing strong demand emanating from the EV 
battery market. The double-digit price growth experienced over the past 
year was also driven by geopolitical and supply risk concerns given that
 the Democratic Republic of Congo is currently the world's largest 
source of cobalt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As cobalt prices have a 
limited impact on overall battery pack costs, high prices are not 
expected to cause supply-chain disruptions or delay EV market growth. As
 a result, the risk of cobalt substitution in EV battery production in 
the near term is relatively low given cobalt's unique energy 
transference properties. While battery manufacturers continue to explore
 alternatives to cobalt, the likely beneficiary of any substitution is 
expected to be Class 1 nickel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cobalt supply deficits 
are expected to continue over the next few years. In addition to demand 
from industrial end users, speculative investors are also driving up 
cobalt prices by stockpiling inventory, further exacerbating supply 
deficit concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moa Joint Venture (50% interest) and Fort Site (100%)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Moa JV produced 4,134
 tonnes of finished nickel in Q4 2017, up from 3,782 tonnes produced in 
Q4 2016, despite mixed sulphides production being negatively impacted by
 abnormally heavy rainfalls in November and December 2017. Finished 
nickel production on a 12-month basis was 15,679 tonnes in 2017, in line
 with expectations for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q4 2017 revenue for the 
Moa JV and the Fort Site totaled $123.0 million, up 32% from $92.5 
million last year. The growth was driven by higher production and higher
 realized prices for nickel, cobalt and fertilizer. Nickel sales 
represented 50% of total Q4 2017 revenue while cobalt sales represented 
33%. Fertilizer sales in Q4 2017 were up 19% from last year, reflecting 
stronger demand and higher realized prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mining, processing and 
refining (MPR) costs for Q4 2017 were US$4.89 per pound, down from 
US$4.93 per pound for Q4 2016. The decline was largely due to higher 
production volumes in Q4 2017. MPR costs on the full-year basis were 
US$4.80 per pound for 2017, up from US$4.63 per pound for 2016. The 
US$0.17 increase per pound in 2017 was attributable to higher energy 
costs, although partly offset by cost savings of approximately US$0.50 
per pound achieved with the commissioning of the third acid plant at Moa
 in the fourth quarter of 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite higher energy and
 sulphur input costs, Moa's NDCC of US$1.80/lb of finished nickel in Q4 
2017 was the lowest experienced since Q3 2004. The cobalt credit of 
US$3.54/lb reflects Moa's high cobalt to nickel production ratio as well
 as the 125% growth in cobalt prices since Q4 2016. NDCC improvement 
also benefited from the commissioning of a third sulphuric acid plant at
 Moa in 2016 that generated approximate savings of US$0.50/lb. NDCC on a
 12-month basis was $2.35/lb, down from $3.42/lb for 2016. NDCC for 2017
 was significantly lower than expectations for the year, due largely to 
higher cobalt by-product credits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash provided by 
operations in Q4 2017 totaled $32.5 million, up from a loss in Q4 2016 
when Hurricane Matthew and the subsequent collapse of bridge 
infrastructure negatively impacted production. Cash flow from operations
 in Q4 2017 was also positively impacted higher realized nickel and 
cobalt prices..</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moa's sustaining capital 
spending in Q4 2017 was $7.7 million, up from $4.7 million in Q4 last 
year. The increase was attributable to the timing of expenditures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ambatovy Joint Venture (12% interest effective December 11, 2017)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with its partners, 
Sherritt completed the restructuring of the Ambatovy Joint Venture on 
December 11, 2017. The restructuring led to Sherritt's ownership 
interest being reduced to 12% in exchange for the elimination of $1.4 
billion of debt. Sherritt's financial and operational results at 
Ambatovy are presented on a 40% basis to December 10, 2017 and on a 12% 
basis effective December 11, 2017. Sherritt will continue to serve as 
operator of Ambatovy at least through 2024, however, as a result of the 
reduction in its ownership interest, Sherritt's ability to direct local 
decision-making at Ambatovy has diminished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finished nickel 
production at Ambatovy in Q4 2017 was 3,111 tonnes, down from 5,111 
tonnes for the comparable period of 2016, which represented Ambatovy's 
highest ever production total. The year-over-year decline was due to a 
number of developments that impacted plant reliability. Most notably, 
the failure of an economizer in one of the acid plants reduced 
production capacity to approximately 50% during November and December of
 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finished nickel 
production on a 12-month basis for 2017 was 13,618 tonnes, down from 
16,842 tonnes for 2016. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to 
equipment failures that reduced the reliability of Ambatovy's acid plant
 and pressure acid leach circuit. Maintenance activities and replacement
 of equipment completed in 2017 are expected to improve plant 
reliability and production stability over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finished cobalt 
production in Q4 2017 was 245 tonnes, down from 404 tonnes for the same 
period of 2016. The decrease was tied to plant reliability issues 
previously cited that lowered production. Cobalt production for 2017 was
 1,173 tonnes, down from 1,309 tonnes for 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MPR costs for Q4 2017 
were US$5.76 per pound, up from US$3.97 per pound in Q4 2016. MPR costs 
on a full-year basis were US$6.01 per pound in 2017, up from US$4.89 per
 pound in 2016. The year-over-year increases were largely due to higher 
input costs as well as lower production volumes in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NDCC for finished nickel 
at Ambatovy in Q4 2017 was $3.26/lb, up from the $3.10/lb for Q4 2016. 
The increase was due to lower production, higher maintenance costs, 
higher energy and sulphur input costs offset by higher cobalt by-product
 credits. NDCC on a 12-month basis $3.83/lb for 2017, down from $4.27/lb
 for 2016. Ambatovy's NDCC for 2017 places it slightly above the 50(th) 
percentile of industry average cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subsequent to year end, 
facilities at the Ambatovy Joint Venture were impacted by Tropical 
Cyclone Ava, a Category 2 hurricane equivalent storm. Damage to 
equipment and the acid production facilities resulted in a temporary 
halt in production. Repairs have since been completed and partial 
production has resumed. A ramp up in production is expected through the 
end of Q2 2018.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross working-interest 
oil production in Q4 2017 in Cuba was 10,378 barrels of oil per day 
(bopd), down from 14,470 bopd for the comparable period of 2016. The 
decrease was primarily due to the expiration of the Varadero West 
Production Sharing Contract (PSC) in November 2017 and natural reservoir
 declines. Gross working-interest oil production on a 12-month basis for
 2017 was 13,479 bopd, in line with guidance for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue in Q4 2017 was 
$27.7 million, down 9% from $30.6 million for last year. The decline was
 due to lowered production, partially offset by an increase in realized 
prices of 23% to $48.82 per barrel in Cuba, though partially offset by 
the negative impact of a stronger Canadian dollar. Revenue on a 
full-year basis was $127.0 million, up 17%. The increase was driven 
largely by higher realized prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total net working 
interest production for Q4 2017 was 6,101 barrels of oil equivalent per 
day, down from 8,163 barrels in the same period of 2016. The decline was
 due to lower cost-recovery spending, the impact of the expiration of 
the Varadero West PSC already cited and the impact of higher oil prices 
in the current year period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unit operating costs in 
Q4 2017 in Cuba were $12.24 per barrel, up 12% from $10.95 in Q4 2016,

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Power production in Q4 
2017 was 201 gigawatt hours ("GWh") of electricity, down 10% from 224 
GWh for the comparable period of 2016. The decline was largely due to 
reduced <b>gas</b> supply. Power production on a 12-month basis was 848 GWh for 2017, down from 894 GWh for 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average realized prices 
in Q4 2017 declined to $54.01 per Megawatt hour ("MWh') of electricity 
from $56.24 per MWh in Q4 2016. The decline was due to the appreciation 
of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. currency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue in Q4 2017 
totaled $12.0 million, down 15% from $13.7 million for Q4 2016. The 
decrease is attributable to lower production and lower realized prices. 
Revenue on a full-year basis was $51.2 million, down from $58.6 million 
for 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash flow from operations in Q4 2017 grew by 264% to $5.3 million due to changes in working capital in the quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unit operating cost in Q4
 2017 was $23.43 per MWh of electricity, down 5% from $24.73 per MWh for
 Q4 2016. The decrease was due principally to reduced maintenance 
activities at the Boca and Puerto Escondido facilities this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total capital spending in
 Q4 2017 was $0.1 million, down from $0.4 million for the comparable 
period of last year. For the full year, the decline in capital spending 
was primarily due to the absence of service concession spending this 
year.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 annual Energy New Ventures competition effectively deconstructs the 
myth that innovation isn't happening in the energy sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is. And it's happening
 in the startup ecosystem, driven by individuals who might once have 
worked within the giant corporate energy infrastructure but are now on 
the outside and seeking to do things better, faster and cheaper.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's fifth annual competition, sponsored by the <span class="companylink">University of Calgary</span>'s
 Hunter Hub for Entrepreneurial Thinking, saw companies pitch ideas to 
tackle some of the grand challenges facing the oilpatch. Those would 
include everything from emissions management and water treatment to the 
use of data analytics to optimize production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A day earlier, the issue 
of energy sector innovation was raised by Kelly Craft, the U.S. 
Ambassador to Canada, and Canadian Ambassador to the U.S. David 
MacNaughton during a discussion hosted by the <span class="companylink">Energy Council of Canada</span> in Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Craft highlighted how innovation and technology has unlocked oil and natural <b>gas</b>
 reserves in the U.S. She also mentioned - several times - the 
importance of research and innovation to the energy future of the 
continent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Innovation is something 
Canada, the United States and Mexico have agreed is critical to further 
North America's vast energy resources," said Craft, while relating how <span class="companylink">Natural Resources Canada</span> officials recently visited the U.S. National Lab in Berkley, Calif. to explore future opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She went on to tout the economic benefits, backed by research from consulting firm <span class="companylink">IHS</span> that demonstrated how every state is benefiting from growth in the energy sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's an observation 
British Columbians and Premier John Horgan need to understand. They, 
too, benefit from Alberta's energy sector, as does all of Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower prices for energy - means a better price at the pumps for consumers and as feedstocks for petrochemical plants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a bit of an unintended slap, however, when Craft referenced how <span class="companylink">Nova Chemicals</span> is investing in its Ontario petrochemical plant after securing a low-cost feedstock - natural <b>gas</b> from the Utica and Marcellus plays south of the border.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That one hurt. It should be natural <b>gas</b> from the west supplying that plant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Craft also emphasized the
 Trump administration's efforts to streamline the permitting process for
 new infrastructure to capitalize on the economic opportunity. That 
particular message seems to get lost in Canada, especially between B.C. 
and Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's ambassador picked up the thread of innovation and the need for progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I do not believe in 
going backwards, but I think we face so many challenges ... not just in 
the energy sector," said MacNaughton. "By standing still, we will fall 
behind. I am more ambitious. There are new challenges that we face in 
the energy world ... that means that we do need to update what we are 
doing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We also need to 
collaborate a lot more on how we get ... community acceptance for things
 like pipelines and major infrastructure."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two ambassadors, 
along with presenters at the Energy New Ventures event, also expressed 
the need to move away from the "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" 
mentality that's pervasive in terms of trade and energy companies 
experimenting with new technology and processes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latter has gotten 
better, largely due to the oil price collapse that forced change within 
the sector. Yet there still remains a view that innovation means doing 
the same thing, only cheaper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also interesting to 
hear from those pushing the innovation boundaries that the differences 
between the speed at which decisions are made to try new technologies in
 the U.S. versus in Canada. The consensus is there's a greater appetite 
in the U.S. to take risks associated with a new idea, process or 
technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That raises a number of 
questions, including whether some of the disincentive lies in the 
regulatory approval process. There is also the practical matter of how 
the innovators survive, even when they have a viable process or idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One challenge is that big
 companies make investment decisions that can stretch out over decades. 
The startup or tech company wants to sign a deal in the short term, to 
either validate a process or technology, or because they're ready to 
launch their product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There remains a 
disconnect between the sense of urgency to support continued innovation -
 that makes the sector strong, and helps to give it the necessary '<b>social license</b>'- and the long term investment horizons of companies in a position to adopt new technologies but reticent to take the risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The energy sector has 
been disrupted by technology. Without it the U.S. wouldn't have reached 
record oil production, as it did last week. The challenge is to be part 
of the next wave of disruption - and not left watching from the 
sidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, companies 
that pitched their ideas to private equity and venture capital investors
 from Calgary and Vancouver reflected the activity taking place within 
the oilpatch and make the sector more competitive and able to address 
the environmental challenges. It's also working to align its values with
 a younger demographic, whose talent it will need in the near future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was an encouraging 
window into what's happening - and what's possible. Deborah Yedlin is a

Justin Trudeau has the jurisdiction to push back B.C.'s new threat to 
block the Trans Mountain pipeline, but does he have the will?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Prime Minister hoped 
he had done the politics on pipelines in 2016, long before an election, 
balancing approval of an expansion of the pipeline to Burnaby, B.C., 
with a price on carbon and a climatechange agreement with provinces. But
 the mess is back, and that spells trouble for Mr. Trudeau.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">British
 Columbia's NDP government, which depends on Green Party support to 
survive, announced a review of whether a bitumen spill could be properly
 cleaned up – and said it would regulate to block any increase the flow 
of bitumen through the province and onto tankers until that review is 
completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If this were just a 
jurisdictional fight between B.C. and Ottawa, it would be pretty easy 
for Mr. Trudeau to push back. B.C. has powers to regulate its 
environment, but approving pipelines, and the inter-provincial 
transportation of resources such as oil, is federal jurisdiction. The 
pipeline is supposed to meet provincial rules, but if B.C. is using them
 to frustrate the federal government's powers, it would have a hard time
 making its case in court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this is politics. Mr.
 Trudeau has to worry that if he picks a fight with B.C., it shines the 
spotlight on his approval of the Trans Mountain pipeline. That just 
brings up a decision that is unpopular with environmentally conscious 
Liberal voters, and with some of the constituents of Liberalheld ridings
 in the Lower Mainland. The Liberals wanted the controversy to cool 
down, not fire up as the 2019 election gets closer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Alberta Premier 
Rachel Notley called an emergency cabinet meeting on Wednesday and 
threatened legal action if B.C. tries to prevent the flow of more 
bitumen, federal Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr was mum, standing 
pat on a terse statement he issued on Tuesday. That statement said the 
Liberal government stands by its approval of the pipeline – but did not 
warn B.C. it does not have the power to obstruct the decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Notley's government 
wants Ottawa to make a stronger statement. “Alberta also expects the 
federal government to stand up and defend the constitution and its 
significance to the economic stability of the country," Cheryl Oates, 
Ms. Notley's director of communications, said in an e-mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were already significant court challenges filed by First Nations and 157 conditions that pipeline promoter <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd</span>.
 had to meet. The B.C. government has every right to review whether it 
is really feasible to clean up a spill of diluted bitumen. But their 
right to apply environmental protections is likely to stop at Ottawa's 
power to approve pipelines. Among the plans, according to B.C.'s 
backgrounder, is to broaden its authority over marine affairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ottawa has the sole 
power to regulate the navigation and shipping of the oil tankers that 
would carry the diluted bitumen, said Dalhousie University law professor
 Aldo Chircop, a professor of maritime law at Dalhousie University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the moment, B.C. has 
not said just how it proposes to regulate to prevent an increase in the 
amount of bitumen that flows through the province, but almost any 
effective measure is likely to meet a pretty stiff challenge from those 
who insist it is Ottawa's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having jurisdiction does 
not help Mr. Trudeau with his political problem, though. He thought he 
had finessed the issue in 2016 by promising to balance approval of the 
pipeline with climate action. Mr. Trudeau and Ms. Notley argued that 
climate policy was supposed to help provide the “<b>social license</b>" 
for oil sands development and pipelines. Mr. Trudeau also got the 
government of former BC Liberal premier Christy Clark to buy in by 
pumping $1.5-billion into an ocean protection plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That neat piece of work 
is unravelling now. B.C. Premier John Horgan is already facing tension 
with his Green Party partner Andrew Weaver over approval of the Site C 
dam and apparent interest in liquefied natural <b>gas</b> projects. He has to talk tough on Trans Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trudeau, meanwhile, 
cannot just ditch his promise to make sure Canadian resources get to 
market – that was the balance between development and environment he 
promised. But it is politically dangerous to act too tough with a B.C. 
government that argues it is protecting its citizens against 
environmental risks, especially as an election gets nearer.</p>

 &nbsp;("Pulse" or the "Company") (TSX-V: PUL) reports today on the 
independent resource assessment (the "Resource Assessment") of the 
Company's Nisku Enhanced Oil Recovery ("EOR") project in the Bigoray 
area of Alberta ("Bigoray").</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estimate, completed by <span class="companylink">Sproule Associates Limited</span>
 ("Sproule"), an independent qualified reserves evaluator, with an 
effective date of&nbsp;December 6, 2017, includes the Bigoray EOR 
project potential only, and is in addition to the previously disclosed 
baseline independently assessed reserves in the Company's core areas at 
Bigoray and Queenstown.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Resource Assessment was prepared in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Oil and <b>Gas</b> Activities&nbsp;of the Canadian Securities Administrators ("NI 51-101") and the Canadian Oil and <b>Gas</b>
 Evaluation Handbook ("COGE Handbook"). Sproule assessed a best estimate
 Discovered Petroleum Initially in-Place of 23.292 million barrels of 
oil ("boe") within Pulse's 100% controlled Nisku D and Nisku E Pools, 
which Pulse views as being conservative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the Resource
 Assessment provides estimates categorized as "high", "best" and "low" 
for contingent resources associated with the Bigoray EOR project on the 
two pools, with the unrisked high estimate being 8.07 million boe (92.6%
 Oil), a best estimate of 6.136 million boe (91.3% Oil) and a low 
estimate of 3.668 million boe (89.1% Oil).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, the 
Resource Assessment prepared by Sproule calculated risked contingent 
resources where the risked assessment assigned a 77% chance of Pulse 
proceeding with the EOR project (see Table 2 below) and resulting in a 
best estimate of risked contingent resources net to Pulse of 4.694 
million boe (91.2% Oil).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Cadenhead, Chief 
Operating Officer of Pulse, commented, "The Sproule Resource Assessment 
is a positive independent commercial confirmation for our Bigoray Nisku 
Enhanced Oil Recovery project. Although this assessment used a more 
conservative approach to Petroleum Initially in-Place ("PIIP") compared 
with the PIIP estimates of the Alberta Energy Regulator, we are excited 
to see that even this more conservative approach resulted in a strong 
endorsement for the project. With an independent un-risked high case 
upside estimated at over 8 million boe's of contingent resources (92% 
oil), the opportunity to move forward with our EOR project to&nbsp; 
bring on stream substantial cashflow while targeting to recover those 
types of oil volumes without drilling a well, creates a substantial 
opportunity to enhance value for Pulse and our shareholders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Resource Assessment 
focussed exclusively on two Nisku pools only in the Bigoray area, and 
included just 2,720 acres of Pulse's 44,720 acre core area holdings 
which includes 14,000 acres at Bigoray alone. Future evaluations may be 
done on Pulse's Mannville, Cardium and Pekisko formations that are 
thought to also provide significant growth opportunities for the Company
 as well as additional Nisku assets/pools held within Pulse's existing 
holdings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cadenhead further 
added, "As part of the Resource Assessment, the evaluator assessed a 
total risk of 77% that the project would proceed, citing economic 
factors and/or timing of development as one of the only risks associated
 with the project. All technical risks such as evaluation drilling, 
regulatory approvals, technology, legal factors, infrastructure and 
markets, political factors and social licence were all assigned 100% 
chance of commerciality.&nbsp;Our goal is to make this project happen in
 2018 and with the oil price market appreciating heading into 2018, the 
economics of this EOR project and return for shareholders continue to 
look more and more attractive alongside improving oil prices." 
&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Resource Assessment 
is based on the results from seventeen wells and, where available, core 
data. Where core was not available, the assessment considered log data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resource 
volumes for these discovered resources have been classified as 
'development unclarified' with Sproule assessing that there is a high 
probability of the Bigoray EOR project becoming a commercial 
development. Pulse will continue to complete project planning associated
 with the project and move forward with its execution plans in 
2018.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Significant positive 
factors relevant to the estimate of Pulse's contingent resources from 
the Bigoray EOR project include success of miscible flood development in
 nearby analogous Nisku reservoirs, a discovered thick oil column 
providing volumes for the deployment of enhanced oil recovery through a 
miscible flood and a nearby infrastructure allowing for access to 
market. Significant negative factors relevant to the estimate of Pulse's
 contingent resources from the Bigoray EOR project include uncertainty 
to how the previously fully waterflooded pools will respond to a 
miscible flood, economic viability uncertainty, as project capital and 
operating costs are unclear and areal uncertainties in the estimation of

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resource Definitions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resources encompasses all
 petroleum quantities that originally existed on or within the earth's 
crust in naturally occurring accumulations, including Discovered and 
Undiscovered (recoverable and unrecoverable) plus quantities already 
produced. "Total Resources" is equivalent to "Total Petroleum Initially 
In-Place". Resources are classified in the following categories:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total Petroleum Initially
 In-Place ("TPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is estimated to 
exist originally in naturally occurring accumulations. It includes that 
quantity of petroleum that is estimated, as of a given date, to be 
contained in known accumulations, prior to production, plus those 
estimated quantities in accumulations yet to be discovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovered Petroleum 
Initially In-Place ("DPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is 
estimated, as of a given date, to be contained in known accumulations 
prior to production. The recoverable portion of DPIIP includes 
production, reserves, and Contingent Resources; the remainder is 
unrecoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources are 
those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established 
technology or technology under development but which are not currently 
considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more 
contingencies. Economic Contingent Resources (ECR) are those contingent 
resources that are currently economically recoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undiscovered Petroleum 
Initially In Place ("UPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is 
estimated, on a given date, to be contained in accumulations yet to be 
discovered. The recoverable portion of UPIIP is referred to as 
Prospective Resources and the remainder is unrecoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective Resources are
 those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application 
of future development projects. Prospective Resources have both an 
associated chance of discovery and a chance of development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unrecoverable is that 
portion of DPIIP and UPIIP quantities which is estimated, as of a given 
date, not to be recoverable by future development projects. A portion of
 these quantities may become recoverable in the future as commercial 
circumstances change or technological developments occur; the remaining 
portion may never be recovered due to the physical/chemical constraints 
represented by subsurface interaction of fluids and reservoir rocks. 
Uncertainty Ranges are described by the Canadian Oil and <b>Gas</b> Evaluation Handbook as low, best, and high estimates for reserves and resources as follows:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low Estimate: This is 
considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities
 recovered will exceed the low estimate. If probabilistic methods are 
used, there should be at least a 90 percent probability (P90) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the low estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best Estimate: This is 
considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will actually be
 recovered. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities 
recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate. If 
probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50 percent 
probability (P50) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or 
exceed the best estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High Estimate: This is 
considered to be an optimistic estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual remaining 
quantities recovered will exceed the high estimate. If probabilistic 
methods are used, there should be at least a 10 percent probability 
(P10) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the 
high estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development Unclarified 
is a project maturity sub-class of contingent resources that refers to 
the development plan evaluation is not complete and there is ongoing 
activity to resolve any risks or uncertainties.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certain resource estimate
 volumes disclosed herein are arithmetic sums of multiple estimates of 
DPIIP or UPIIP, which statistical principles indicate may be misleading 
as to volumes that may actually be recovered. Readers should give 
attention to the estimates of individual classes of resources and 
appreciate the differing probabilities of recovery associated with each 
class as explained under this&nbsp;Resource Definitions&nbsp;section.</p>

an energy economist at the University of Calgary's school of public 
policy. At $50 a tonne, the annual cost is $1,111 in Alberta and $603 in
 B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's no small change in a
 lousy provincial economy with high unemployment. Polls consistently 
show strong disapproval of the tax, which piles on top of higher taxes 
and increased environmental regulations that are depressing job creation
 in the oil and <b>gas</b> sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's hefty carbon 
tax is one of the big pieces of the province's climate leadership plan, 
pushed through by Notley's government when Alberta's conservatives were 
in disarray and political implications seemed remote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question is whether 
Albertans embrace the tough medicine and its benefits, as claimed by the
 government, or will slam the door on the tax grab when they return to 
the polls next year. That's what the UCP, which reunited conservatives 
last year and picked Kenney to lead them, is counting on. Meanwhile, the
 duelling views are clashing hard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">University of Calgary 
economics professor Trevor Tombe said the carbon tax is controversial 
because it's visible in heating bills and at the pumps and because of 
its negative economic impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even government estimates show it shrinks GDP and deters employment, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the plan, the tax 
increases to $50 a tonne by 2022 to line up with federal goals. But 
other provinces are taking longer to ramp up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carbon is priced at $19 a tonne in the cap and trade market in Quebec and Ontario.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Provinces without carbon 
pricing are subject to the federal carbon price, which starts at $10 per
 tonne in 2018 and rises by $10 per year to $50 per tonne in 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta NDP says the benefits of its carbon tax include economic diversification away from oil and <b>gas</b>, job creation from greener jobs, emissions reductions, tax rebates for those with lower incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, green job creation hasn't offset the estimated 100,000 oil and <b>gas</b> jobs lost over the last three years, partly due to Alberta's climate change plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cheryl Oates, 
communications director for Notley, said 2,000 jobs have been created 
from energy efficiency programs so far and another 1,300 jobs are 
expected. The recently announced winning bidders of renewable 
electricity projects are expected to create another 740 jobs, with 7,000
 jobs overall expected in new renewable energy by 2030.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province estimates it
 will collect $1.038 billion in revenue from the tax in fiscal 2017-18, 
rising to $1.396 billion in 2018-2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All revenue from carbon 
pricing is reinvested back into Alberta's economy to reduce emissions, 
support renewable energy and help Alberta families and businesses adjust
 to the price of carbon," said Oates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government also 
argues that even with the increase in carbon pricing, Alberta has an 
overall tax advantage compared to other provinces because it has no 
provincial sales tax, health premium or payroll tax. It estimates 
Albertans and Alberta businesses will still pay at least $8.7 billion 
less in total taxes and carbon charges than if the province had the same
 tax system and carbon pricing as other provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney says he would 
immediately repeal the "job killing tax" if elected premier - and at the
 same time put a big dent in the federal government's own climate change
 plan, which relies on Alberta toeing the line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Alberta families and 
jobcreators have suffered enough under this NDP government, and now they
 have to endure a 50 per cent increase in a carbon tax that hasn't 
converted a single opponent of Alberta's energy industry into a 
supporter," Kenney said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The carbon tax was supposed to buy '<b>social license</b>'for
 pipelines to get built. Instead, since the NDP announced its plan, 
Justin Trudeau vetoed approved Northern Gateway, Barack Obama vetoed 
Keystone XL, the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span> 
effectively killed Energy East, and the NDP government in B.C. is doing 
everything it can to block TransMountain. Not one single government, 
party, or special interest group has gone from 'no'to 'yes'on pipelines 
as a result of the NDP's failed tax on everything."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the trend continues, 
and the two remaining pipeline projects aren't built, Notley would hand 
her political opponents another big gift by showing the tax is all pain 
and no gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this time, the odds 
are hard to call because the future of both Keystone XL and the Trans 
Mountain expansion depend on the resolution of legal disputes with 
opponents. Financial Post ccattaneo@nationalpost.com</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 Canadian natural resources industry is undergoing enormous change. 
Volatile energy prices — the reality of US 55 per barrel — reduced 
production reliability, uncertain market access, the government’s 
climate change agenda, tightening environmental policy, safety, and 
compliance concerns along with increasing social drivers, such as <b>social license</b> to operate, all have resulted in industry upheaval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There seems to be a 
consensus that technological innovation is now more critical than ever 
to maintain the competitiveness of the oil and <b>gas</b> industry. 
According to Deloitte, “The industry is at a critical juncture where 
companies must go beyond merely acknowledging the need to innovate and 
start executing upon this imperative in a systematic way or else their 
long-term survival may be in jeopardy.”&nbsp;1</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At
 the same time, according to the Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance 
(COSIA), when speaking to Canada’s standing committee on natural 
resources, “While some technologies are already in or nearing 
commercialization, many, especially the more transformative ones, could 
take more than a decade to become available for deployment. There is 
about a 10-year time horizon from ideation to commercial deployment in 
the oil and <b>gas</b> sector.”&nbsp;2</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How does the industry 
pursue innovation to drive real business value realization, find more 
innovative ways to cut costs, increase revenues, create more productive 
solutions in exploration and development, and make better decisions on 
operational risk — all while accelerating the pace to commercial 
deployment?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For starters, we work 
together. It sounds like a cliché but when key players, producers, 
research and technology innovators come together, the opportunity to 
vastly accelerate common industry agendas is realized. The healthcare 
industry is a perfect example of such transformative innovation through 
shared agendas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transformative technology like AI, advanced algorithms, machine-learning and cloud systems — powered by the <span class="companylink">IBM</span>
 Watson platform — made its first impact in healthcare in 2012 starting 
with oncology — the study and treatment of cancer and tumors. Why 
healthcare? Two reasons: First, human health impacts us all, and second,
 the amount of data in the global healthcare industry is massive and AI 
systems like <span class="companylink">IBM</span> Watson are built for 
big data challenges. Medical journals, clinical studies, medical text 
books, x-ray and scanning film, and personal healthcare records are full
 of important data, and the healthcare industry shares a common agenda —
 to deliver the best possible care to patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With this in mind, key healthcare organizations and <span class="companylink">IBM</span>
 came together to build an oncology treatment advisor. Watson ingested 
millions of pieces of structured, unstructured and complex data — from 
both public and private sources — and dramatically changed the face of 
patient care. From there, <span class="companylink">IBM</span> Watson 
and other industries joined forces to accelerate the pace of advancing 
common industry challenges within the banking and insurance, 
manufacturing, retail, education and yes, the oil and <b>gas</b> and mining industries, to drive real innovation across the value chain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Secondly, when industry 
players work together on shared agendas, they also align current 
research, expertise and emergent technology solutions to existing 
challenges to accelerate immediate term profitability goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notice we’re focusing on 
immediate term? We all know that when economic climates constrain, the 
focus rapidly turns to short-term performance as uncertainty drives up 
risk in longer-term innovation and capital project commitments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-investment in shared 
industry programs delivers benefits almost impossible to reap as 
individual organizations, such as reduced project and development 
resources, reduced costs associated with common deployment environments,
 lower cost recovery thresholds and the benefit of higher reusability of
 program components and artifacts that reduces the need for redundant or
 new work efforts for each project initiation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirdly, when industry 
players come together to form common agendas, they can more broadly 
capitalize on technological innovation and research such as the Internet
 of Things (IoT) and connected operations, predictive analytics, 
blockchain, cloud and AI. To be an innovator, you need to take risk, and
 with risk comes increased liability and the possibility of failure. 
According to the <span class="companylink">World Economic Forum</span>, “the global oil and <b>gas</b> industry has at least 10 years to go before reaching a similar level of digital maturity to aerospace or automotive.”3</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The natural resources 
industry has access to a tremendous amount of valuable data, technology 
and research capabilities. They are very good at collecting data, and 
the growth in data management service providers in the oil and <b>gas</b>
 industry supports this data collection; However, in the last five to 
ten years the growth in computing power and advanced technologies to 
capitalize and draw insight, understanding and predictions from 
historical data, and public data sources, has not been fully realized. 
The oil and <b>gas</b> industry still struggles with turning data into 
actionable insights that drive faster, safer and more intelligent work. 
The evolution of the industry from outdated legacy systems — not capable
 of handling the data and computer processing power available today — to
 more powerful operational focusses enabled digital systems will take 
time, effort, capital and most of all, a significant cultural change in 
the way the industry works and operates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imperative to the 
industry is the evolution to a modern operational architecture that can 
ingest the “4 V’s” of data — volume, variety, velocity and veracity — 
from internal and external sources, then integrate that insight into 
enterprise processes and workflows for meaningful outcomes. The 
advancement of AI platforms focused in specific industry verticals over 
the last five years, enables computing systems and AI to focus on 
simplifying the intensive processes and complexity in data collection 
and information retrieval, and even predictions, allowing the geologists
 and engineers to make better judgment calls and actions based on their 
experience and the new insights AI brings to their data sets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strategic enablement of digital technologies in the oil and <b>gas</b> industry is now fundamental to its survival. At <span class="companylink">IBM</span>, we believe there is a place for shared agendas to advance innovation through digital transformation.

He regained consciousness two days later. Medical staff told him he had

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The doctors said it's a 
miracle for me to be here,” he says. “All everybody kept saying is they 
couldn't understand how I woke up from this.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crawford's initial 
diagnosis, detailed in his chart at Saskatoon Health Region, reads: 
“Post-inhalation injury of hydrogen sulphide,” which included symptoms 
of “loss of smell sense,” “difficulty swallowing and hoarseness.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Workers' Compensation
 Board accepted his injury claim a month later. A report from the WCB 
said Crawford was “struck in the face by a combination of crude oil, 
water and H2S <b>gas</b>,” which led to “difficulty breathing,” 
intubation, “inflammation of the throat area,” “lung collapse,” 
“swallowing and speech problems,” “olfactory paralysis” and “frequent 
severe headaches.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key factor in his diagnosis was H2S, a “toxic and irritating” substance that “affects basic metabolism.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The scarring documented 
of the palate/uvula area is almost certainly from the chemical burn he 
suffered from the H2S,” the report reads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The diagnosis came as no surprise to Crawford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I worked for quite a few
 oil companies and that was the only site I was ever nervous going 
into,” he says. “They said it was a sweet, not sour, field but every 
well we went into had HS2 marked on it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, industry and
 provincial Ministry of the Economy (ECON) officials were already 
dealing with complaints and concerns about H2S in southeast 
Saskatchewan, according to internal documents.</p>

 in which a teenager was overcome by H2S in their driveway near Oxbow, 
Sask., triggered inspections of 11 oil and <b>gas</b> facilities. All 
failed with “serious infractions,” including releasing H2S at lethal 
levels “that may be exceeding 150,000 (parts per million),” according to
 an internal memo from December 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No fines or public 
warnings followed. No escalated enforcement, penalties or prosecutions 
followed. The problem continued. But Crawford and his other oilfield

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are growing public
 concerns regarding the air quality issues in southeast Saskatchewan,” 
wrote an official with the industry's largest group, the <span class="companylink">Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP)</span>. “This has the potential to become a broader industry reputation/<b>social license</b> concern and warrants immediate attention by operators in the region.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a March 2013 letter,

risk is significant,” read the minutes from the April 7, 2014 meeting. 
“Risk is highest for the workers, at the source … Are we creating a risk
 by not releasing this data immediately?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was never made public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May 2014, Michael Bunz
 died from H2S exposure from a broken valve on an oil tank near Carlyle,
 Sask. His employer is facing three charges under the province's 
occupational health and safety legislation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saskatchewan's 
regulations require that when workers are in situations that are 
“immediately dangerous” to life or health, employers and contractors 
“shall ensure that the worker is provided with and uses an approved 
atmosphere-supplying respirator” and that “a second worker, suitably 
equipped and trained, is present and in communication with the worker at
 all times.” The case remains before the courts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Bunz, Crawford was working alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There was nobody on 
site, which you're supposed to have,” he says. “After reading the story 
about Mr. Bunz, I just think this is so unnecessary … These oil 
companies keep doing the same thing and nothing changes. The government 
keeps letting them getting away with it. And I'm a forgotten person.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce Peachey, a petroleum engineering instructor at the <span class="companylink">University of Alberta</span>,
 says rules to warn workers about the potential presence of H2S and 
ensure two workers are present in dangerous situations are standard 
safety measures in the oilpatch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Aaron Thompson, 
program director for the occupational medicine at the University of 
Toronto, says that to lose consciousness, as Crawford did, signifies a 
“critical” incident that should have been reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That would seem to be a breakdown in reporting and a breakdown in the occupational health and safety system.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Provincial officials 
stated the province has increased inspections of wells and facilities 
that process high volumes of H2S, added inspectors and enforcement 
activities, erected air-monitoring stations and acquired highly 
sensitive hand-held measurement devices that allow inspectors to 
identify the source of sour <b>gas</b> odours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crawford says he filed complaints with <span class="companylink">Cona Resources</span> and the <span class="companylink">Mullen Group</span>,
 a transportation company that subcontracted to D.J. Heiland Trucking, 
but was never interviewed and never told of any investigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“All the safety guys came back and tried to blame the accident on me,” Crawford says of <span class="companylink">Mullen Group</span>, whose subsidiary, R.E. Line Trucking, is listed in some WCB documents as his employer. “I was in no shape to fight them.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Mullen Group</span> officials declined to be 
interviewed for this story. In a written statement, chairman and CEO 
Murray Mullen denied that company officials blamed Crawford. The 
statement confirms Crawford contacted the company's subsidiary, R.E. 
Line Trucking, two weeks after the incident and informed them he had 
“sustained a throat injury.” The statement says the subsidiary conducted
 an investigation along with Cona and D.J. Heiland Trucking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The statement does not detail that investigation, but says the area where the facility is located does not have H2S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This incident was not 
H2S related as you have alleged,” it reads. “We are not aware of any 
H2S-related incidents that would have required Saskatchewan 
(Occupational Health and Safety) reporting.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That conclusion contradicts Crawford's medical assessments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July 2014, a 
specialist in Montreal detailed Crawford's inability to swallow well, 
sleep apnea and speech problems “after his hydrogen sulphide exposure.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neurologist Michael Sidel concluded that Crawford suffered from “decreased taste and smell” as a result of exposure to H2S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sidel updated that 
assessment last year, stating Crawford suffers from “chronic dizziness, 
unsteadiness and decreased concentration. He has a permanent loss of 
smell and a functional change in his voice since the event. It is most 
probable that Mr. Crawford will not be able to return back to work on a 
permanent basis and his disability to some extent is likely permanent.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crawford's psychologist, 
Dr. Sydney Miller, wrote in 2015 that Crawford was suffering from 
serious PTSD following an injury involving the “inhalation and 
swallowing of hydrogen sulphide <b>gas</b>.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This past summer, 
Crawford says the Saskatchewan Workers Compensation Board threatened to 
stop his benefits and transition him back into the workforce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They were going to cut 
me off. After I said I spoke with (a Toronto Star journalist three weeks
 ago), now all of a sudden they're paying for everything again.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In principle, we are 
always working towards some form of return to work,” Phil Germain, 
vice-president of prevention at Saskatchewan WCB, said, not addressing 
Crawford's individual case. “That doesn't always happen. Sometimes it 
just can't happen. And that's fine. But we wouldn't be doing our job if 
we weren't trying.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sitting down for a meal, 
Crawford now goes through a ritual of liquefying his food and swallowing
 each mouthful slowly while pressing two fingers under his jaw to help 
it down with a slight gagging motion — among the many lingering effects 
of Feb. 9, 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I lost my house, I lost 
my truck, I lost everything I had. Thank God my parents are alive. If 
they weren't alive, I don't know where I'd be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was the healthiest guy
 in the world. I played hockey, I did sports, I hunted, I fished, I 
helped my dad with his renovation company, I worked, I had fun. Now, I 
don't do much.”</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 Canadian natural resources industry is undergoing enormous change. 
Volatile energy prices — the reality of US 55 per barrel — reduced 
production reliability, uncertain market access, the government’s 
climate change agenda, tightening environmental policy, safety, and 
compliance concerns along with increasing social drivers, such as <b>social license</b> to operate, all have resulted in industry upheaval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There seems to be a 
consensus that technological innovation is now more critical than ever 
to maintain the competitiveness of the oil and <b>gas</b> industry. 
According to Deloitte, “The industry is at a critical juncture where 
companies must go beyond merely acknowledging the need to innovate and 
start executing upon this imperative in a systematic way or else their 
long-term survival may be in jeopardy.”&nbsp;1</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At
 the same time, according to the Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance 
(COSIA), when speaking to Canada’s standing committee on natural 
resources, “While some technologies are already in or nearing 
commercialization, many, especially the more transformative ones, could 
take more than a decade to become available for deployment. There is 
about a 10-year time horizon from ideation to commercial deployment in 
the oil and <b>gas</b> sector.”&nbsp;2</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How does the industry 
pursue innovation to drive real business value realization, find more 
innovative ways to cut costs, increase revenues, create more productive 
solutions in exploration and development, and make better decisions on 
operational risk — all while accelerating the pace to commercial 
deployment?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For starters, we work 
together. It sounds like a cliché but when key players, producers, 
research and technology innovators come together, the opportunity to 
vastly accelerate common industry agendas is realized. The healthcare 
industry is a perfect example of such transformative innovation through 
shared agendas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transformative technology like AI, advanced algorithms, machine-learning and cloud systems — powered by the <span class="companylink">IBM</span>
 Watson platform — made its first impact in healthcare in 2012 starting 
with oncology — the study and treatment of cancer and tumors. Why 
healthcare? Two reasons: First, human health impacts us all, and second,
 the amount of data in the global healthcare industry is massive and AI 
systems like <span class="companylink">IBM</span> Watson are built for 
big data challenges. Medical journals, clinical studies, medical text 
books, x-ray and scanning film, and personal healthcare records are full
 of important data, and the healthcare industry shares a common agenda —
 to deliver the best possible care to patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With this in mind, key healthcare organizations and <span class="companylink">IBM</span>
 came together to build an oncology treatment advisor. Watson ingested 
millions of pieces of structured, unstructured and complex data — from 
both public and private sources — and dramatically changed the face of 
patient care. From there, <span class="companylink">IBM</span> Watson 
and other industries joined forces to accelerate the pace of advancing 
common industry challenges within the banking and insurance, 
manufacturing, retail, education and yes, the oil and <b>gas</b> and mining industries, to drive real innovation across the value chain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Secondly, when industry 
players work together on shared agendas, they also align current 
research, expertise and emergent technology solutions to existing 
challenges to accelerate immediate term profitability goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notice we’re focusing on 
immediate term? We all know that when economic climates constrain, the 
focus rapidly turns to short-term performance as uncertainty drives up 
risk in longer-term innovation and capital project commitments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-investment in shared 
industry programs delivers benefits almost impossible to reap as 
individual organizations, such as reduced project and development 
resources, reduced costs associated with common deployment environments,
 lower cost recovery thresholds and the benefit of higher reusability of
 program components and artifacts that reduces the need for redundant or
 new work efforts for each project initiation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirdly, when industry 
players come together to form common agendas, they can more broadly 
capitalize on technological innovation and research such as the Internet
 of Things (IoT) and connected operations, predictive analytics, 
blockchain, cloud and AI. To be an innovator, you need to take risk, and
 with risk comes increased liability and the possibility of failure. 
According to the <span class="companylink">World Economic Forum</span>, “the global oil and <b>gas</b> industry has at least 10 years to go before reaching a similar level of digital maturity to aerospace or automotive.”3</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The natural resources 
industry has access to a tremendous amount of valuable data, technology 
and research capabilities. They are very good at collecting data, and 
the growth in data management service providers in the oil and <b>gas</b>
 industry supports this data collection; However, in the last five to 
ten years the growth in computing power and advanced technologies to 
capitalize and draw insight, understanding and predictions from 
historical data, and public data sources, has not been fully realized. 
The oil and <b>gas</b> industry still struggles with turning data into 
actionable insights that drive faster, safer and more intelligent work. 
The evolution of the industry from outdated legacy systems — not capable
 of handling the data and computer processing power available today — to
 more powerful operational focusses enabled digital systems will take 
time, effort, capital and most of all, a significant cultural change in 
the way the industry works and operates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imperative to the 
industry is the evolution to a modern operational architecture that can 
ingest the “4 V’s” of data — volume, variety, velocity and veracity — 
from internal and external sources, then integrate that insight into 
enterprise processes and workflows for meaningful outcomes. The 
advancement of AI platforms focused in specific industry verticals over 
the last five years, enables computing systems and AI to focus on 
simplifying the intensive processes and complexity in data collection 
and information retrieval, and even predictions, allowing the geologists
 and engineers to make better judgment calls and actions based on their 
experience and the new insights AI brings to their data sets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strategic enablement of digital technologies in the oil and <b>gas</b> industry is now fundamental to its survival. At <span class="companylink">IBM</span>, we believe there is a place for shared agendas to advance innovation through digital transformation. We’ve just launched the <span class="companylink">IBM</span> Watson for Natural Resources Innovation program in the Canadian oil and <b>gas</b>

will advance business transformation and focus on a collaborative

 —On Dec. 6, The Northern Miner sat down for an exclusive interview with
 Tom Butler, CEO of the U.K.-based International Council of Mining and 
Metals (ICMM), to discuss climate change politics, as well as other 
prominentchallenges and themes on the international stage heading into 
2018.Butler became CEO of ICMM in July 2015. Before that, he spent 18 
years with the <span class="companylink">World Bank</span>'s <span class="companylink">International Finance Corporation</span> in the infrastructure and natural resource teams, with much of that time focused on mining and power projects in Africa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Northern Miner: What are some thoughts on how the mining industry is perceived globally today?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Butler: There's a trust gap, and the question is: How do we close it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mining industry isn't doing well in many countries. You see that in the loss of <b>social license</b>
 where governments feel they have political room to take actions because
 the industry doesn't have the support of local populations. So there's a
 lot of work to be done when it comes to communicating the positive 
impacts of mining and getting local populations behind that message. 
That's especially true in developing countries where the industry can be
 a real agent of change when it comes to alleviating poverty and 
bringing resources into an economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, we hear a lot about climate change and the expectation that industry should do its part. I think the oil and <b>gas</b>
 industry has been hit harder by that message because there's an 
awareness that mining is going to supply the raw materials needed to 
"decarbonize" the world. And it's not just minerals like lithium and 
cobalt, but also resources like iron ore and metallurgical coal. We 
believe some of Canada's major companies are really emerging as leaders 
in the climate change discussion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: What are some of the challenges mining companies face on the international stage heading into 2018?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TB: There are really 
three key issues you hear a lot about right now. First, society is 
expecting the private sector to add a lot more value to stakeholders, 
and not just shareholders. So that means we need to deliver on 
sustainable development goals, address climate change and deal with 
inequality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, there's a lot of 
attention paid to resource scarcity in the broader sense, and that goes 
beyond scarcity of minerals. It includes things like water, air and 
human resources. That’s leading to growing pressure around issues like 
water management at mine sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Third, there are now 
expectations for much greater accountability and transparency. So that 
means citizens are getting much more involved in terms of where they put
 their money. They want to know about their investments, and there's 
much greater demand for environmental, social and governance criteria to
 be published and disclosed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: It can be difficult 
to quantify the near-term financial benefits vis-à-vis investments on 
things like green energy and “decarbonizing.” How does that impact the 
dynamic between stakeholders, shareholders and capital markets?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TB: We believe there's 
more alignment between shareholders and stakeholders than many people 
recognize. The companies realize that the major investors — including 
pension funds — are watching what's happening with these issues. I 
mentioned that growing realization in capital markets that people are 
very interested in where their money is being invested. A growing number
 of funds are using governance, environmental and social criteria in 
judging investments. Certainly climate footprint is an element investors
 consider when making decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we're talking about <b>social license</b>
 to operate, and delivering on citizen expectations, these are things 
that can create a number of issues in the final analysis. If you're on 
the wrong side of the reputation debate you run the risk of having 
people not wanting to invest, which could impact the share price. 
Ultimately, there's no value for shareholders in shutting down, or 
losing, a valuable project due to a lack of local support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: There’s also a 
segment out there that’s anti-development insomuch as it represents 
opposition to mining and natural resources, generally. How do you deal 
with messaging like, for example, Apple saying it intends to make 
iPhones out of completely recycled material to "stop mining the planet”?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TB: You can sit down at the table with everyone. I think that movement is still very much on the fringe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact is if we're 
going decarbonize economies and deliver the material society needs, 
particularly as people move into the middle class in places like China, 
there's going to have to be a huge amount of commodities supplied by the
 mining industry. You're not going to get that out of purely recycled 
material.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that really 
highlights the importance of communication and leveraging platforms like
 social media to really get our message out there. We need to continue 
to underline the role mining will play in supplying the technology 
sector. It’s important for society to understand that mineral extraction
 is really part of the solution to many of these challenges.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Brian Schmidt, president and CEO of Tamarack Valley Energy Ltd. and a current board member of the <span class="companylink">Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP)</span>,
 said that in recent years the Canadian oilpatch has been delivered a 
series of “body blows” that have hindered the ability of companies to 
raise cash. Coupled with the impacts of the prolonged downturn, and it’s
 been tough sledding.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And
 Schmidt, who is chairman of CAPP’s Alberta Executive Policy Group, says
 current governments are doing little to help the situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think in other 
downturns we had help from governments that were interested in 
supporting our business. But we don’t have that right now. We’re pretty 
much on our own,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In fact, we’ve been 
dealt some significant body blows with pipeline issues, increased

 working against the industry right now. And I think the [cancelation

think we understand the total impact of. It was quite negative,” Schmidt
 added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So if you’re an investor
 and looking at several jurisdictions, Canada is not seen as a friendly 
jurisdiction to do business right now because of the complications we’ve
 had over the years. And that contrasts to other downturns where 
government and industry worked together to get some of these projects 
underway and did what it took to get it done. I’m not seeing that right 
now. I think the industry is on its own and you can expect more negative
 pressures here.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Leach, president of

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is a remarkable state of affairs for a country that relies heavily on the oil and <b>gas</b>
 industry to help balance its foreign trade, provide high paying jobs 
that supports equalization payments that flow from Alberta and 
Saskatchewan and contribute billions of dollars to federal and 
provincial coffers in royalties and taxes,” Leach said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It illustrates the 
inability of Canada’s political leadership at the federal and provincial
 levels to come together on what should be clear national interests: to 
make sure the nation’s non-renewable energy exports find markets at the 
highest world market price. It also illustrates the tremendously 
effective campaigns by industry opponents to influence politicians, 
policy and election outcomes in Canada.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Leach’s view, current 
government inaction and stance on some major energy projects runs 
counterintuitive to the nation’s best interests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I can’t think of another
 major energy producing nation, particularly among the world’s 
functioning democracies, with the potential Canada has to meet growing 
global demand, and yet has been so hobbled by its own governments in 
meeting that demand. Indeed, it’s no coincidence that a country like 
Canada with robust legal protection for the right to protest and with 
generous opportunities to intervene in the regulatory approval process, 
has attracted so much organized opposition,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s particularly disturbing when I think we can genuinely make the case there is no oil and <b>gas</b> industry in the world that has a better track record when it comes to responsible energy development. Even the head of the <span class="companylink">International Energy Agency</span>
 (Fatih Birol)in an October speech stated: ‘I wouldn't subscribe to the 
idea that we won't need oil anymore and a country like Canada, a 
reliable partner, a reliable producer, reliable exporter has a role to 
play in the global energy markets.’”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘Above ground issues’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Peter Tertzakian, executive director of ARC Energy Research Institute, 
said that while increased regulations are an issue, the challenges 
facing the oil and <b>gas</b> industry run much deeper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s broader than that. 
There’s the issue of Indigenous people and nimbyism—it’s just all 
wrapped up. It’s a very broad thing. I don’t want to be quoted as saying
 ‘it’s because of the government, or regulation or whatever.’ It’s far 
beyond that,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think it’s a large basket. I actually categorize it as ‘above ground issues.’&nbsp; The oil and <b>gas</b>
 industry has two dimensions. There’s the below ground issues of rock 
quality, the ability to get the stuff out of the ground, technology 
etcetera. So what’s happened is the below ground risks have diminished 
significantly over the last few years, but the above ground risks have 
been amplified,” Tertzakian added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And the above ground 
issues, all the way from local nimbyism to broad-based regulatory, to 
Indigenous issues and so on have increased. There’s no question that a 
lot of those above ground issues collectively are a drag on investment. 
It’s a very complex issue. I think we can agree that it’s the collective
 above ground dynamics that have hindered investment potential in 
Canada.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Duane Bratt, a political 
science professor at Calgary’s Mount Royal University, said the federal 
government’s decision to reorganize the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board (NEB) </span>has added to the challenges facing Canada’s oil and <b>gas</b> industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I do think the reorganization and the changes to the <span class="companylink">NEB</span>
 are significant. I don’t believe they’re the sole reason, or possibly 
even the major reason for the Energy East cancellation—I think the 
numbers that some economists have put forward talk about increased 
capacity and those sorts of things—but the fiddling with the <span class="companylink">NEB</span> is a problem,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Even if it wasn’t a 
problem with Energy East, it will be in other ones for a number of 
reasons. I think one of them is just the whole idea of looking at 
upstream and downstream effects. That becomes very complicated.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, Bratt is of 
the belief that the overall attractiveness of Canada’s oilpatch to 
would-be investors remains relatively intact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I would think our 
reputation remains quite good. It’s a politically stable country. Yeah, 
[governments] have brought in emissions standards and carbon taxes, but 
those carbon taxes are consumer-wide, economy-wide,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They’re not just focused
 solely on producers. I think it’s really about a cost issue. We’re a 
more costly economy to invest in, but a safer place to invest.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Combating the challenges: What can the industry do better?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bratt said that oil and <b>gas</b> industry efforts to obtain <b>social license</b> for large-scale projects and other industry-related initiatives have often fallen short.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And what’s interesting about that is you hear critics of <b>social license</b>
 say it’s a [Prime Minister Justin] Trudeau term or an [Alberta Premier 
Rachel] Notley term, but it’s not. It actually came out of the Canadian 
mining industry and has now been applied to larger types of projects, 
including those in the oil and <b>gas</b> industry,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you were to read Jim 
Prentice’s book [Triple Crown: Winning Canada’s Energy Future] or Dennis
 McConaghy’s book [Dysfunction: Canada After Keystone XL], they’re quite
 critical of the things that industry has done. And [industry] needs to 
share some of the blame for some of these [unsuccessful] projects, as 
well,” Bratt added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The MRU professor added that the oil and <b>gas</b>
 industry has done a relatively poor job in successfully informing the 
general populace of its successes and operational and environmental 
improvements, of which there are many.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The thing is, a lot of 
the work that industry has been doing on emission reductions in the 
oilsands, for example, I don’t think have been particularly well known 
and they have trouble getting that message out because for years, 
executives, and some of the industry groups, were denying there was ever
 even a problem,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Meanwhile, their 
scientists were working on ways of dropping emissions. So there’s 
actually I think some good news stories with some of the research and 
development that’s been done.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Canadian oil and <b>gas</b>
 sector has done better in recent years in its attempts to get its 
message across, Tamarack Valley’s Schmidt says there’s still work to be 
done in leveling the playing field against well-funded and organized 
opponents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think we have to 
realize that there’s a lot of money—and I would say out of country 
money—that’s coming in to campaign against the hydrocarbon industry 
here. And I think we’ve been far too complacent as an industry of just 
kind of letting that happen and then letting things go unanswered,” he 
said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So I think we need to be getting our message out there in different ways and more effectively and consistently.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leach believes that the 
industry has begun to successfully, for the most part, respond in recent
 years to the “shifting targets” of protesters who oppose energy 
infrastructure projects and the sector as a whole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We all remember the 
negative publicity around hydraulic fracturing and the industry and 
regulators effectively responded with science-based regulations and best
 practices to tackle concerns about chemical use, water consumption and 
induced seismicity. The target of opponents then shifted to pipelines 
where Canadian oil and <b>gas</b> producers are uniquely vulnerable due to government policy failures to ensure infrastructure was built when needed,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Ultimately I think the necessary pipelines and facilities to accommodate Canadian production of bitumen, liquids and natural <b>gas</b>
 in the next couple of decades will be built, but unfortunately years 
late. For example, both the B.C. and federal governments are signaling 
they are motivated to ensure that another LNG project does not fail.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leach added that the 
“evolving position” of the Alberta government on energy and pipelines is
 “proof attitudes can change, especially when you want to get 
re-elected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And as the disastrous 
effects of Ontario’s green energy policies on that province’s 
competitive position become more apparent to voters, we should expect a 
similar shift among a sufficient number of Canadian voters to influence 
national policies too,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not(ley) enough?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier Notley has 
embarked on a cross-Canada travelling road show to highlight the 
benefits of vital pipeline infrastructure, including in Vancouver and 
Central Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Schmidt, though appreciative, said that effort, that provincial government support, should have happened sooner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think [Notley] is 
doing the right thing in advocating for pipelines and how important they
 are to Canada. I don’t think Canadians, in general, understand how 
significant these projects are and how it impacts our ability to pay for
 health care and education and some of the things we enjoy right now,” 
he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think there’s a 
serious disconnect between the public and these pipelines. So I applaud 
Premier Notley for getting out and getting the word out, and she’s 
obviously going against some of her colleagues’ policies. So I think 
it’s good. But I think it’s too little, too late.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schmidt also said the attempt of the Notley government to attain <b>social license</b>
 for pipelines and other infrastructure by invoking a carbon tax and 
other environmental-directed measures may have not been the best laid of
 plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think the idea of getting so-called <b>social license</b> by giving into the Green movement and carbon taxes and that sort of thing really hasn’t worked,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think a far better 
strategy would be to compare how clean and how regulated our industry 
is. We’re the most regulated jurisdiction in the world. And that, I 
think, is something we should be very proud of as Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So not allowing our oil and <b>gas</b>
 to get to world markets just means the dirtier stuff and the stuff with
 conflict is going to get produced. I think that’s a better argument 
than carbon taxes or shutting down coal plants, that sort of thing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not the end of days</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the many issues and challenges facing the sector, Tertzakian said the Canadian oil and <b>gas</b> industry still has a viable future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think there’s a 
tendency for some to think that the whole industry is shut down. That’s 
far from the truth. The reality is that the industry is producing and 
exporting more oil and <b>gas</b> than ever. Consumers are consuming 
more than ever. Investment in certain segments of the business is 
showing signs of improvement,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So in some ways, given 
all these above ground issues, it’s remarkable that the industry 
continues to operate as well as it does. I would caution, though, it’s 
not just because of these above ground issues. There’s disruptive 
changes happening in the world of capital markets—migration to ETFs, for
 example.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tertzakian said that some
 companies are adapting to the “new realities” better than others and 
those that stumble in the needed transition likely won’t fare well going
 forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The industry is going to
 look different, recognizing that these above ground issues are unlikely
 to relent anytime soon,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The narrative I believe 
is that this industry is going to be part of what I call ‘the suppliers 
of the future.’ Those companies that understand above ground and below 
ground, those are going to be the suppliers of the future—those that 
know how to manage and execute amidst the disruptions we’re seeing both 
above ground and below ground.”</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 Canadian natural resources industry is undergoing enormous change. 
Volatile energy prices — the reality of US 55 per barrel — reduced 
production reliability, uncertain market access, the government’s 
climate change agenda, tightening environmental policy, safety, and 
compliance concerns along with increasing social drivers, such as <b>social license</b> to operate, all have resulted in industry upheaval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There seems to be a 
consensus that technological innovation is now more critical than ever 
to maintain the competitiveness of the oil and <b>gas</b> industry. 
According to Deloitte, “The industry is at a critical juncture where 
companies must go beyond merely acknowledging the need to innovate and 
start executing upon this imperative in a systematic way or else their 
long-term survival may be in jeopardy.”&nbsp;1</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At
 the same time, according to the Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance 
(COSIA), when speaking to Canada’s standing committee on natural 
resources, “While some technologies are already in or nearing 
commercialization, many, especially the more transformative ones, could 
take more than a decade to become available for deployment. There is 
about a 10-year time horizon from ideation to commercial deployment in 
the oil and <b>gas</b> sector.”&nbsp;2</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How does the industry 
pursue innovation to drive real business value realization, find more 
innovative ways to cut costs, increase revenues, create more productive 
solutions in exploration and development, and make better decisions on 
operational risk — all while accelerating the pace to commercial 
deployment?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For starters, we work 
together. It sounds like a cliché but when key players, producers, 
research and technology innovators come together, the opportunity to 
vastly accelerate common industry agendas is realized. The healthcare 
industry is a perfect example of such transformative innovation through 
shared agendas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transformative technology like AI, advanced algorithms, machine-learning and cloud systems — powered by the <span class="companylink">IBM</span>
 Watson platform — made its first impact in healthcare in 2012 starting 
with oncology — the study and treatment of cancer and tumors. Why 
healthcare? Two reasons: First, human health impacts us all, and second,
 the amount of data in the global healthcare industry is massive and AI 
systems like <span class="companylink">IBM</span> Watson are built for 
big data challenges. Medical journals, clinical studies, medical text 
books, x-ray and scanning film, and personal healthcare records are full
 of important data, and the healthcare industry shares a common agenda —
 to deliver the best possible care to patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With this in mind, key healthcare organizations and <span class="companylink">IBM</span>
 came together to build an oncology treatment advisor. Watson ingested 
millions of pieces of structured, unstructured and complex data — from 
both public and private sources — and dramatically changed the face of 
patient care. From there, <span class="companylink">IBM</span> Watson 
and other industries joined forces to accelerate the pace of advancing 
common industry challenges within the banking and insurance, 
manufacturing, retail, education and yes, the oil and <b>gas</b> and mining industries, to drive real innovation across the value chain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Secondly, when industry 
players work together on shared agendas, they also align current 
research, expertise and emergent technology solutions to existing 
challenges to accelerate immediate term profitability goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notice we’re focusing on 
immediate term? We all know that when economic climates constrain, the 
focus rapidly turns to short-term performance as uncertainty drives up 
risk in longer-term innovation and capital project commitments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-investment in shared 
industry programs delivers benefits almost impossible to reap as 
individual organizations, such as reduced project and development 
resources, reduced costs associated with common deployment environments,
 lower cost recovery thresholds and the benefit of higher reusability of
 program components and artifacts that reduces the need for redundant or
 new work efforts for each project initiation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirdly, when industry 
players come together to form common agendas, they can more broadly 
capitalize on technological innovation and research such as the Internet
 of Things (IoT) and connected operations, predictive analytics, 
blockchain, cloud and AI. To be an innovator, you need to take risk, and
 with risk comes increased liability and the possibility of failure. 
According to the <span class="companylink">World Economic Forum</span>, “the global oil and <b>gas</b> industry has at least 10 years to go before reaching a similar level of digital maturity to aerospace or automotive.”3</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The natural resources 
industry has access to a tremendous amount of valuable data, technology 
and research capabilities. They are very good at collecting data, and 
the growth in data management service providers in the oil and <b>gas</b>
 industry supports this data collection; However, in the last five to 
ten years the growth in computing power and advanced technologies to 
capitalize and draw insight, understanding and predictions from 
historical data, and public data sources, has not been fully realized. 
The oil and <b>gas</b> industry still struggles with turning data into 
actionable insights that drive faster, safer and more intelligent work. 
The evolution of the industry from outdated legacy systems — not capable
 of handling the data and computer processing power available today — to
 more powerful operational focusses enabled digital systems will take 
time, effort, capital and most of all, a significant cultural change in 
the way the industry works and operates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imperative to the 
industry is the evolution to a modern operational architecture that can 
ingest the “4 V’s” of data — volume, variety, velocity and veracity — 
from internal and external sources, then integrate that insight into 
enterprise processes and workflows for meaningful outcomes. The 
advancement of AI platforms focused in specific industry verticals over 
the last five years, enables computing systems and AI to focus on 
simplifying the intensive processes and complexity in data collection 
and information retrieval, and even predictions, allowing the geologists
 and engineers to make better judgment calls and actions based on their 
experience and the new insights AI brings to their data sets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strategic enablement of digital technologies in the oil and <b>gas</b> industry is now fundamental to its survival. At <span class="companylink">IBM</span>, we believe there is a place for shared agendas to advance innovation through digital transformation. We’ve just launched the <span class="companylink">IBM</span> Watson for Natural Resources Innovation program in the Canadian oil and <b>gas</b>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Webber, author and mechanical engineering professor at the University of Texas at Austin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Source: <span class="companylink">University of Texas at Austin</span>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineering professor 
Michael Webber is deputy director of the University of Texas at Austin's
 Energy Institute, where one of specialties is researching the 
intersection of energy infrastructure engineering and policy. S&amp;P 
Global Market Intelligence talked with Webber about the challenges 
natural <b>gas</b> pipelines face in the current political, regulatory 
and market environment, as well as potential remedies for the industry. 
The following is an edited transcript of the conversation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S&amp;P Global Market 
Intelligence: There have been some recent decisions stalling or, in some
 instances, even overturning pipeline project approvals. Is this a sign 
that courts are becoming more sympathetic to pipeline opponents, or 
instead are pipeline opponents' arguments becoming more sophisticated?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Webber: I don't 
think courts have changed their outlooks, necessarily. I do think the 
opponents have become more sophisticated in two ways. One, I think their
 coalitions are a little more diverse, so it's not just the 
environmental groups. They often bring in land-rights groups, and so 
they get a little more of an ideological spread that way. The other 
thing is they focus more of their effort on midstream rather than 
production sites. For a long time, opponents to oil and <b>gas</b> would
 focus on production to stop the extraction. Then they found over time 
that stopping the midstream is easier and it has the same effect because
 if you can't move <b>gas</b> to market, then you wouldn't produce in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second piece to this 
is as time goes on, accidents happen. Every single accident of a 
pipeline, every spill or leak or problem, becomes part of the collection
 of evidence against pipelines. Time is on the side of the opponents. 
The more time goes on, the more accidents will happen, and that's used 
as part of the case to stop the construction of new pipes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think all projects are 
seeing the same kind of thing, which is more legal action at the 
midstream level, and more groups are brought to the table for that legal
 action. Every leak that happens just damns the case. The more leaks 
that happen, especially if it's the same company or pipeline or region, 
makes it that much harder to get approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is there anything developers can do to counter this momentum that opponents seem to have?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not sure what the 
best strategy is, but I think there are advantages if pipeline 
developers explain the relative safety of pipes versus trains. An 
alternative to moving by pipe is to move oil by train, for example, and 
trains have their own safety record that's problematic. They could talk 
about the comparative safety and cleanliness of the pipe versus the 
train.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other thing they could talk about is the comparative safety of piped <b>gas</b> than coal, for example, because there's less pollution from <b>gas</b>
 and [fewer] people will die from respiratory infection. They've got the
 argument that pipelines actually offer an environmental advantage, 
compared to rail or coal. I think you'll start to see that kind of thing
 happen more and more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What do midstream companies need to focus on in order to maintain their <b>social license</b>? Is that at risk in a post-Dakota Access and post-Keystone XL U.S.? If it is, how big of a risk factor are we talking about?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think it is a risk. The
 midstream sector needs to do a better job developing stakeholder groups
 they can communicate well with and explain the broader argument of why 
it's beneficial to have pipelines. It's ultimately something pipeline 
companies have done a bad job on, that sort of social engagement, and 
that's how they get opposition. It could be life or death for a certain 
pipeline, not necessarily to the companies, but if they can't get a <b>social license</b>, they can't get a permit, they can't build or operate the pipeline. Absolutely, it's a high-stakes situation for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking out to 2018, 
what's the one area you think pipeline companies should focus on to 
ensure that a project will be successful?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pipelines tend to be at 
their best when they are first built. Brand-new materials degrade over 
time because the soils shift or because of corrosion of the pipelines. 
The problem with pipelines is not year one, but maybe year 20, year 40 
in its lifetime. One way to deal with that is to build in a fund that 
accumulates money so when the money is needed to improve or replace a 
pipeline, the money is available. It's easier to do that early on before
 you need it than to wait until you need it to do it. I feel like that 
should be part of what's going on with pipelines is built-in funding for
 when inevitably a problem occurs, to avoid that problem and then to 
mitigate that problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is there anything else you want to mention that we have not covered?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The infrastructure of midstream, in general, is an important part of energy, not just for oil and <b>gas</b> and pipelines. Moving energy around is a difficult task and is required for all forms of energy.</p>

 - In an ornate ballroom in one of downtown Calgary's few Edwardian 
hotels, hundreds of dark-suited men and women gathered over lunch 
Tuesday to hash out one of the questions festering at the heart of 
Alberta's politics: What really happened to Energy East?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>
 pipeline was intended to be a win-win project: Alberta would gain 
access to tidewater for its beleaguered bitumen; oil would travel to a 
refinery on Canada's east coast; resources would stay in the country. 
But in October the company killed it, inspiring interprovincial rancour 
and darkening the province's increasingly sour mood.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter to the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>
 explaining its decision, the company cited "delays resulting from the 
regulatory process," among other obstacles. Andrew Leach, a professor of
 energy policy at the University of Alberta and one of the architects of
 Alberta's climate change policy, was among the loudest voices crying 
foul over <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s implication. 
Canning Energy East was a reasonable business decision inspired by low 
oil prices, reduced oilsands production forecasts and the imminent 
approval of Keystone XL, Leach had argued publicly in the wake of the 
announcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, Leach gathered with Dennis McConaghy, <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s
 former executive vice-president of corporate development, and Martha 
Hall Findlay, president of the Canada West Foundation and once a Liberal
 MP for a Toronto riding, to hash the matter out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leach contended that 
Energy East's fate was clear once Trump was elected. Oil prices are low,
 production predictions have been slashed, and once Keystone XL was back
 on the table, the less-efficient Energy East was doomed. "It was the 
most expensive of the pipeline projects, so the one you naturally take 
off the deck," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Energy East panel, left to right: Andrew Leach, Dennis McConaghy and Martha Hall Findlay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McConaghy took issue with
 that position. Energy East already had shipping contracts lined up, he 
said, and while Alberta might indeed maintain adequate pipeline supply 
if both Keystone XL and the TransMountain pipeline are approved, the 
fate of those two projects is still uncertain. (Keystone XL is still 
awaiting sign-off from Nebraska's state government, while TransMountain 
must face an interprovincial intransigence so entrenched that Alberta 
premier Rachel Notley plans to go on a cross-country road trip to 
support the project.) Energy East would have been a viable third option,
 and oil companies were willing to pay the price of potentially having 
too much capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The real tragedy of losing Energy East was that a set of circumstances evolved to reach a point where <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>
 couldn't just suspend the project, but went on to terminate it, and 
that was fundamentally driven by a conviction they could never get the 
permit," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The regulatory process 
has simply become so unpredictable that no sane company will throw 
billions of dollars behind a project that can be cancelled on a 
political whim, just as Northern Gateway was, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is total 
uncertainty in this country about whether we can get anything built," 
Hall Findlay said, adding that among resource companies Canada was 
beginning to acquire the reputation for political uncertainty of a 
banana republic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no political 
clarity around what this country wants or what it will approve, she 
added. The approvals process is now taking decades, in hopes of creating
 a <b>social license</b> that will never be granted by staunch 
anti-oilsands activists. The cost of that delay for business can reach 
hundreds of millions of dollars per month.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McConaghy said that if 
the government wants to impose an even-handed carbon strategy, well, 
fine. Just make that clear upfront and apply it to all industries 
equally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not like these 
points haven't been made to the Trudeau government," he said. The 
government heard all these gripes and then "dismissed all the actual 
problems and instead advocated for more open-ended engagement, as if the
 regulatory process were a focus group as opposed to a technocratic 
exercise."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the eyes of both Hall 
Findlay and McConaghy, nothing exemplified this more than Energy East. 
After the regulatory process had begun, the <span class="companylink">NEB</span> said that it would take into consideration greenhouse <b>gas</b>
 emissions from the oilsands and the oil burned after it left the line 
rather than just the emissions of the actual pipeline. This was 
untenable, they argued, the sort of standard that would never be applied
 to central Canadian industries. It would be like judging the approval 
of an auto plant based on the lifetime emissions of all the cars it 
produced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The final straw was moving the goalposts," Hall Findlay said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Establish what the 
strategy is and then let our regulatory bodies implement those 
directions. But let them do their jobs. If every decision then comes 
back to what is a political win, we will not get anything done."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> executives announce the company's Energy East Pipeline project on Aug. 1, 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there was no doubt in
 Hall Findlay's mind that the cancellation of Energy East was celebrated
 in the Prime Minister's office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When that announcement 
was made, there were champagne bottles popping in Ottawa," she said. As 
the Liberals face more competition from the NDP, the pipeline "would 
have been a major, major headache for the federal Liberals."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite this, both Hall 
Findlay and Leach warned about the increasingly vicious rhetoric 
currently being bandied about across provincial lines: UCP leader Jason 
Kenney has said he would scrap Alberta's carbon tax and cut permits to 
oil pipelines feeding B.C. if it continues to stall the TransMountain 
expansion. Those threats only add to the culture of political 
uncertainty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But McConaghy nonetheless echoed the darker sentiment now rippling through much of the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think it's naive to 
think that in a scenario where Keystone XL doesn't happen because of 
Nebraska and TransMountain (falters) because the federal government 
didn't enforce (its regulatory approval, the idea that Alberta is going 
to be saying 'We stepped up. We applied the most stringent carbon tax in
 the country and you stiffed us on market access,'" he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"No one should think the political reaction to that isn't going to be extreme."</p>

 pipeline expansion in British Columbia faces a fresh challenge, Premier
 Rachel Notley will speak to business crowds in three provinces in an 
attempt to build support for the controversial project considered 
critical for Alberta's energy sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley said in an 
interview Sunday she will bring her sales pitch to Toronto, Ottawa, 
Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver later this month in the hopes of 
convincing more Canadians the Trans Mountain expansion project is in the
 country's best interest.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We
 are a very small economic player internationally, and we punch well 
above our weight, but we're not going to be able to do that if we become
 paralyzed by very parochial decision-making," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The oil and <b>gas</b> 
industry continues to contribute significantly to national economic 
growth... To walk away from it is negligent. It's economically 
negligent."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s project, already faced 
with legal challenges, has been met with new resistance in Burnaby, 
B.C., where the municipal government has not issued permits to allow for
 the $7.4-billion pipeline expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arguing Burnaby is intentionally delaying construction, the company has asked the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>
 to intervene and allow for work to begin. That city counters it is 
following its process for reviewing similar development applications and
 rejects the idea it is dragging its feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta will throw its support behind <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> before the <span class="companylink">NEB</span>, which may review the case through written submissions or a short hearing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While United Conservative
 Party Leader Jason Kenney has publicly mused about potential economic 
retaliation against B.C., if that province is successful in blocking or 
stalling <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s project, Notley said she's not interested in "irresponsible sabre-rattling."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're going to make the 
case in a reasonable and responsible way as long as the matter is still 
alive, which it is," the premier said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley, who begins her 
tour Nov. 20 at the Empire Club of Canada in Toronto, may be preaching 
to the converted as she appears before pro-development business crowds 
across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she speaks at the 
Greater Vancouver Board of Trade Nov. 30, her audience will likely be 
sympathetic, but it will give her a platform to reach other British 
Columbians who can be swayed, as she attracts local media attention, 
said George Hoberg, a professor at the University of British Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I suspect her goal is to
 reach the political middle in B.C., to make the best case to those who 
are not in the camp of active, adamant opponents," Hoberg said in email 
exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That audience is 
critical to how responsive the (B.C.) NDP government is likely to be to 
pipeline opponents. It will also be very important in the dynamics of 
protest and police response that will occur, should construction ramp 
up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hoberg, who teaches 
environmental and natural resource policy, also warned that "First 
Nation and environmental opponents to the pipeline will do their best to
 greet Notley and make sure their message continues to get attention as 
well."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley said her 
government - which has attempted to secure support for pipelines by 
imposing a climate change agenda that includes a carbon tax and cap on 
oilsands emissions - has "reasonable levels of credibility" among 
Canadians who are concerned about the environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are people who still can have their mind changed, and it's important to get the facts out there," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prasad Panda, energy 
critic for the United Conservative Party, supports Notley's move but 
argues she should have invited him and other opposition MLAs to join her
 in a united front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Panda said he believes Notley genuinely backs the oil and <b>gas</b>
 industry, but he questioned her decision making, having appointed 
environmentalists Tzeporah Berman and Karen Mahon to an oilsands 
advisory panel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were among several 
panelists who were excused in June, not because of their beliefs, but 
because the group's focus had shifted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both activists have 
openly opposed the Trans Mountain pipeline. Mahon was recently arrested 
after she and three other protestors took to kayaks and roped themselves
 to a barge near <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s marine terminal in Burnaby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For the last two years, 
(Notley) was living in a fool's paradise thinking that by imposing a 
carbon tax and by imposing the cap on oilsands development, she would 
get <b>social license</b>, but that is not the case," Panda said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kinder Morgan chief 
executive Steve Kean recently warned that delays in securing permits and
 regulatory approvals could put the project nine months behind schedule,
 though the company is exploring measures to speed things up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has also 
warned that every month of delay from its planned December 2019 
in-service date would directly cost as much as $35 million, and another 
$90 million a month in lost revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The B.C. government has vowed to use any means at its disposal to stop the project, which would twin <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s
 existing line, more than tripling its capacity and getting more Alberta
 crude to tidewater for export. It also faces legal challenges by 
environmentalists, Indigenous communities and B.C. municipalities.</p>

 Premier Rachel Notley wants to continue to dismiss opposition to 
pipelines by her federal and British Columbia NDP counterparts, she 
should lobby to make the Alberta party a distinct identity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike parties such as 
the Liberals, the New Democrats are integrated at the provincial and 
federal levels. So when Albertans sign up to support Notley and her 
colleagues, they automatically become members of the federal NDP. That's
 why it's strange to hear Notley say federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh's 
hostility toward pipelines is of no consequence.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm
 not going to get too wrapped up in what people who are not in 
government are doing in other parts of the country, in hypothetical

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certainly, it's true that as the leader of the third largest party in <span class="companylink">Parliament</span>,
 Singh isn't in a position to give a green light or red light to energy 
projects, but the optics are terrible. Notley's federal leader is going 
around the country whipping up opposition to projects her government 
says are not only in Alberta's interest, but in the national interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More jarringly, her 
British Columbia NDP cousin, Premier John Horgan, has pledged to use 
every tool at his disposal to block the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline expansion, which was approved by the federal government and his predecessor, Christy Clark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not uncommon to have
 disagreements within families, but surely Notley must realize it's 
untenable to have her colleagues working against her in such bold 
fashion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Singh was in Vancouver on
 Friday, where he said he has three criteria that must be met for any 
energy projects to be approved - that Indigenous rights are respected, 
that Canada can meet its climate change goals if the pipeline goes 
ahead, and that the projects prioritize local jobs. Neither Trans 
Mountain nor the now-shelved Energy East projects met those criteria, 
said Singh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the federal leader praised Notley for her government's initiatives directed at reducing greenhouse <b>gas</b> emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It needs to be pointed 
out, Premier Notley has the most aggressive and comprehensive climate 
change policy in Canada. We won't achieve our climate goals if we don't 
have a premier like Rachel Notley in Alberta," said Singh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ah, that would be the same climate change plan that was supposed to earn so-called <b>social license</b> for pipelines - support that hasn't been forthcoming from Singh and Horgan and their sort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Alberta's NDP party has different views than its federal counterpart, it should take steps to separate the two organizations.</p>

considered the amount of emissions generated by the extraction of the 
oil, as well as when it was burned, perhaps as fuel to power Quebecmade 
Bombardier jets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NEB's overreaching

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Infrastructure Minister Amarjeet Sohi said the move by <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> was a business decision and he dismissed suggestions the culprit was the NEB's new rules.</p>

decision not to proceed with Energy East based on their business 
analysis. It has nothing to do with the federal government's review 
process," Sohi said. Evidently that wasn't the case. "There remains 
substantial uncertainty around the scope, timing and cost associated 
with the regulatory review of the projects," the company said of the 
pipeline and a proposed marine terminal in New Brunswick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"After completing its 
careful review of these factors, the existing and likely future delays 
resulting from the regulatory process, the associated cost implications 
and the increasingly challenging issues and obstacles facing the 
projects, the applicants will not be proceeding further with the

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not only an 
embarrassment that the pipeline's cancellation ensures the East's 
continued dependence on foreign oil, but it is a scandal that Canada 
can't get such projects built in a timely fashion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even pipelines that have been approved are met with opposition and legal challenges, raising doubts about the so-called <b>social license</b> the NDP imagined its provincial carbon tax would earn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The list of abandoned

 emissions form part of the review, a requirement it added midway

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DON MARTIN: Welcome back.
 Our Thursday MP combo of diverse political opinion joins us to talk 
pipelines, plaques, and a phoenix which refuses to rise. Ruby Sahota is a
 Liberal MP from Brampton, Michelle Rempel a Conservative MP from 
Calgary, and the pride of Essex, NDP MP Tracey Ramsey. Welcome to you 
all. Michelle, you heard Jim Carr. Tell me what's the view of Calgary on
 this. What's your reaction, Energy East I'm talking about?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MICHELLE
 REMPEL (Conservative – Alberta): You know, if the Liberals wanted to 
completely shut down the energy sector, I wish we would have just had 
that policy discussion, or the courage to have that policy discussion in
 parliament. The reality is between the carbon tax, which is not going 
to reduce greenhouse <b>gas</b> emissions, between even the small 
business tax issue this week, the changing of the rules for major energy
 projects which require a large capital investment, certainly the 
downstream emission review on this, like, come on, we're not reviewing 
Saudi oil for that. The tanker moratorium that, they actually shut down 
debate on the tanker moratorium bill after only two opposition speakers 
this week. I could go on and on. The reality is all of these things 
combined is an ideological opposition to the energy sector. You heard 
Jim Carr talk about the pipelines that they approved. Well, we approved 
four pipelines under our government. So that's fact. The other component
 is that the government, they refuse to stand up and acknowledge that 
many First Nations communities actually want some of these pipelines to 
be produced. We already have one of the world's strongest regulatory 
systems in the world, and I wish that they would have just had the 
courage to call it national energy program the second, but they were 
smart enough not to. The unfortunate thing is I think that this is going
 to stoke western alienation. I think that this is going to hurt the 
entire economy writ large, and their talking points are very, very weak 
and they're not cognizant of the reality that the energy sector plays in
 the Canadian economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Okay. It is an 
engine of growth out there. Tracey, where is the NDP coming down on 
Energy East? Is this a business decision or political obstruction? 
TRACEY RAMSEY (NDP – Ontario): Well this isn't a surprise because the 
system is broken that we're using. The process that we're using is 
broken. We've been saying that for a very long time. You have to include
 <b>social license</b>. You have to include the communities that are 
impacted. And here we saw the municipalities saying that they didn't 
want this, having the province weigh in. Like when you have people in a 
community who are objecting to what you're doing, then you have to take a
 serious look at that. Until they fix this process, don, you know, no 
project really is going to go through in the way that it should. It's 
not going to have every single aspect looked at, and know that that 
project is good for Canada. We're happy to see this happen. Obviously 
this is something that we were calling for. But it's not a surprise, and
 it's just another example of how the government needs to listen to the 
people in the communities that are impacted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: So, Ruby, I'm sure you want to weigh in somewhere between those two polar opposites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RUBY SAHOTA (Liberal – 
Ontario): Absolutely. Government has been listening, and therefore 
that's why we have a process that has been working and takes into 
account what Indigenous people are saying. It takes into account the 
issue with the emissions. And we have successfully, under this exact 
same process, the process has not changed regardless of what the 
Conservatives want to sell to people, the process is the same and we've 
approved three pipelines since that time. Two oil pipelines, <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>, Line 3, a <b>gas</b> pipeline, Nova <b>Gas</b>,
 and that's created over 25,000 jobs. How many jobs did the 
Conservatives create in that area? Zero! Because you did not, the fact 
is you did not...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: Whoa, whoa, Ruby, come to Calgary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAHOTA: ...any oil pipelines in ten years. We've approved three.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: Keystone, Anchor 
Loop, the Line Nine reversal. Wrong, wrong, wrong, and the reality is 
that there's over 200,000 people that are out of work in Alberta. So 
anybody in Alberta that's talking about jobs created under the Trudeau 
government are actually going to be throwing tomatoes at their screen 
right now. That is such complete malarkey. And I just wish, again, I 
mean we're going to continue to stand up for the energy sector, but I 
think what everybody is going to be doing today is looking at the 
Trudeau government and saying, look, why didn't you just have the 
courage to stand up and say we don't want this to happen. Why just try 
and trick Canadians into thinking anything otherwise?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAHOTA: We absolutely wanted it to happen. It was a business decision at the end of the day made by <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: But why isn't Canada open for business on this? If it's a business... SAHOTA: We're absolutely open to business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: No, what you've 
done is you've, you have changed the rules on a billion dollar capital 
decision. You have changed the rules on the taxation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: You have changed rules and the context and labour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Go ahead Tracey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RAMSEY: This is an 
example of how broken the process was under the previous Conservative 
government. It continues to be under the Liberals. And until this 
process gets fixed, it has to get fixed. This is broken. We saw the 
social licence today coming to play, communities coming into play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: What exactly is broken about this?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RAMSEY: Listening to 
communities. You have to take into account the communities that this is 
traveling through, not just where it's coming and where it's going 
through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: I got to move on. We're running out of time and I want to get to this issue because the "<span class="companylink">New York Times</span>", the "<span class="companylink">Washington Post</span>", the "Times of Israel", the "<span class="companylink">BBC</span>"
 are all covering the story of the missing mention on our brand new 
national holocaust memorial down there. There's no mention of the Jewish
 population that was exterminated in the <b>gas</b> chambers. All we've 
got in place is that millions of men, women, and children were murdered 
during the holocaust, and the survivors who persevered were able to make
 their way to Canada after one of the darkest chapters in history. The 
plaque didn't mention anything about Jews. It has since been removed. 
The government, like what's your reaction to this?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RAMSEY: This is a very 
serious oversight. You know this, we're glad that it's down, but this is
 a very serious oversight that's hurtful to people who are in Canada who
 are descendants of people who are Jewish who faced anti-Semitism. There
 needs to be an acknowledgment of what exactly happened there, and it 
can't be this kind of just vague reference to the amount of people that 
were murdered in the holocaust, so it needs to be fixed. It's just a 
very unfortunate and really a big mistake by the Liberals not catching 
that this should have been an important piece.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: How can you not 
proofread a plaque, or did they just decide they couldn't single out one
 set of victims and decide just to lump it in as men, women and 
children. What did you think when you heard this?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: I guess two 
points. First to that, you know, if you go to any holocaust memorial 
around the world, be it Yad Vashem, or the American holocaust memorial, 
the communities that built those take great pains to talk about the 
Roma, or Jehovah's Witnesses, or members of the LGBTQ community that 
were also included, but the reality is I think a key component of 
anti-Semitism to this day is people who purport that the Jewish 
community somehow made the holocaust up. And the main way that we can 
fight anti-Semitism is by strongly pushing back, and saying unless we 
recognize how many members of the Jewish community were killed simply 
because of their faith under extreme conditions, the saying never again 
won't actually happen. So, you know, this is a pretty big oversight, and
 one that I'm glad was corrected. But I mean, yes, proofreading a plaque
 should have happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: And a bit of a 
global, I mean laughing stock is the wrong word, but certainly we're 
being held up to ridicule around the globe for this. I mean surely 
someone, who should be held responsible for this, Ruby?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAHOTA: I don't disagree 
with anything my colleagues have said. It is a time in our history that 
needs to be acknowledged, and we need to learn from it. We need to call 
it what it was, and, you know, over six million Jews died, so there was 
no excuse. We really appreciate that (inaudible) flagged the issue right
 away and immediately it was removed. On the monument overall, there are
 over 50 mentions of the Jewish people, but this plaque in particular 
had that oversight, and I don't know how that happened but I'm really 
grateful that it was flagged and removed and it's going to be corrected,
 rightfully so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: I know. Well we 
were supposed to talk phoenix, but I'm out of time. And I think phoenix 
is going to continue to flounder around for a while.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: We just want people to get paid, like me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Are you having trouble getting paid?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: MPs aren't 
supposed to get paid, Don, but, no, I think it's, you know, across party
 lines, this is really affecting a lot of public servants and they need 
to, it needs to be fixed. MARTIN: Okay. Well we'll save the blame game 
for another time. All right, thank you all. Have a great break week and a
 happy Thanksgiving. Coming up, fighting back against the military's 
silent killer. Please stay with us.</p>

A national

 the Toronto Star, the National Observer, Global News and journalism 
schools at Regina, Concordia, Ryerson and UBC has uncovered failures by

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Documents obtained 
through freedom-of-information requests and from whistleblowers - 
internal correspondence, meeting minutes, presentations and inspection 
reports - disclose findings of failures in performance by oil and <b>gas</b>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Victims effectively suffocate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government issued no 
public warning after Galloway reported the plume at her home because 
"there was no evidence that this was a widespread failure." But inside 
government and industry offices, documents indicate the seriousness of 
H2S issues that led to years of meetings, audits and proposed regulatory
 reforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On April 7, 2014, 
government and industry officials deliberated about releasing data that 
showed H2S "hotspots" across southeastern Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Government may be 
accused of hiding information," the notes read. "Public will want to 
know: 1. What are the areas? 2. How is it managed? 3. How is the 
government making sure it's managed?" one unnamed official told the 
meeting. "Are we creating a risk by not releasing this data 
immediately?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite acknowledging 
"significant" public health risks from H2S, at least some officials 
present expressed concern about "sensitivity in this data (because) 
there are residents living in these areas."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No release followed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three weeks later, 
government-proposed fines for emission breaches - up to $1 million in 
penalties - were rejected by two major industry groups. In a letter to 
the ministry dated April 29, 2014, the <span class="companylink">Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) </span>and Explorers and Producers Association of Canada (EPAC) called the proposed penalties "unsuitable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A former ministry 
official, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of losing&nbsp;his
 current job in the industry, says "almost every amendment was being 
rejected."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EPAC officials declined comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terry Abel, CAPP's 
spokesperson, said the letter was intended to explain that, "in some 
cases, fines aren't appropriate at all ... If there's an unsafe 
operation, it should be shut down. It shouldn't be operating. That's the
 best way to ensure the public safety is protected."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed fines were dropped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next month, Michael Bunz, a 38-year-old salesman supplying chemicals to oil and <b>gas</b> facilities, lay in a shack 80 kilometres from the Galloway house, dead after being exposed to H2S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The official incident

Eaton, a professor at the University of Regina who has studied the

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A shift in 2012 - from 
the Ministry of Energy and Resources to a new Ministry of the Economy 
tasked with regulating natural resource extraction and promoting 
economic development - changed the ministry's role from watchdog to 
partner, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're thinking about 
returns on investment ... The industry should really be regulated by 
those that have the interests of the environment first."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ministry field staff raised this concern at a meeting on July 1, 2015, between government and industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The role of the 
regulator needs to be adjusted," the meeting's minutes read. "The 
regulators are acting as consultants in some situations. The role of the
 regulator is to enforce the rules and if the rules are clear and if 
enforcement is consistent and clear then, 'cultural' changes can be 
made."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its statement, the ministry rejects criticisms of conflict of interest or lax enforcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Within the Ministry of the Economy, the petroleum and natural <b>gas</b>
 division carries out industry regulation," wrote the department's 
spokeswoman, Deb Young. "It is not involved in investment attraction, 
royalty and tax assessment and land sales. It is solely focused on well,
 facility and pipeline regulation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That regulation has not included fines or prosecutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry has not 
issued a single fine against any industry company "for well over a 
decade," Doug MacKnight, assistant deputy minister responsible for 
petroleum and natural <b>gas</b>, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Generally, we don't have
 to resort to that," he said. "It's usually just a notice to the 
operator to bring themselves into compliance."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prosecutions have also 
not been part of the ministry's enforcement practices because 
non-compliance was dealt with "through other enforcement actions," reads
 the ministry's statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other enforcement actions
 include increased inspections and staff, high-tech equipment for 
detecting emissions and a $69-million inspection reporting database 
(which can't be accessed by the public).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, complaints of illness from residents and workers continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I will sometimes get 
faint, like I will fall over and I have to find a seat quickly," says 
Lori Erhardt, a United Church minister and musician living near Oxbow 
who believes her chronic illness is related to&nbsp;emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I have had a variety of 
diagnoses, most of them end with "i-t-i-s," which means inflammation ...
 If something gets inflamed, if it's blood vesicles, you feel it through
 your body."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the five years' 
worth of documents obtained by this investigation is an April 2012 
PowerPoint presentation to CAPP members by the director of the 
province's petroleum and natural <b>gas</b> division. It includes a map of southeastern Saskatchewan showing a bloom of red and orange circles, labelled "critical sour <b>gas</b> locations."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sources say ministry 
staff pushed to make the data public but senior government officials 
said "there's no goddamn way that is going to be released," according to
 the former ministry source.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's an institutional
 reluctance to make this information public," he said. "The public 
should be able to see all the information that legislators have 
identified as public information such as sour <b>gas</b> and inspection reports."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry statement 
says the map was never approved for release because some data was out of
 date, not comprehensive and "could provide the public and industry with
 a false understanding of risk associated with a particular well or 
facility."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the Galloway incident, the ministry inspected 11 oil and <b>gas</b>
 facilities. All failed "with serious infractions," including releasing 
H2S at lethal levels "that may be exceeding 150,000 (parts per 
million)," Brad Herald, CAPP's Saskatchewan operations manager, wrote to
 the board of governors in December 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those levels are 150 times the amount that could cause instant death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the causes: "It is 
believed that inadequate training on the installation and operation of 
equipment is ... contributing to the air quality issues."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPP's Abel said in an interview the "unsafe" facilities responsible for those breaches should not have been operating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They should have been shut down," he said. "When you follow the rules, processing and production of sour <b>gas</b>
 is absolutely safe. If you don't follow the rules, it can pose a health
 risk. So ultimately, those operators at those facilities were 
responsible."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither CAPP nor its industry partners made the health risks public. And no ministry fines or prosecutions followed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Internally, CAPP quickly mobilized to develop a public relations and damage control plan:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are growing public
 concerns regarding the air quality issues in southeast Saskatchewan," 
Herald wrote, noting a petition and a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Ministry fields one 
to two public complaints concerning odours per week and the issue is 
garnering increasing political attention . . . This has the potential to
 become a broader industry reputation/<b>social license</b> concern and 
warrants immediate attention by operators in the region . . . 
Communications is preparing key messages in the event that there is 
media profile."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPP received a warning 
the next month after consulting a scientist with expertise on managing 
toxic substances, internal emails show. The scientist expressed 
disappointment noting that H2S failures were "so easy to avoid."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientist urged the 
industry lobby group to develop and implement a new code of practice to 
control dangerous emissions and get ahead of the problem by publicly 
denouncing unacceptable practices. The scientist also recommended that 
the industry group pressure the province to step up inspections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry, in meetings with industry, proposed similar reforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter sent in March
 2013 then-energy minister Tim McMillan - now president and CEO of CAPP -
 warned companies to meet "compliance obligations" or face "escalated 
enforcement, penalty and/or prosecution."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ministry and industry met
 four times between 2012 and 2014 to plot strategy, including emergency 
planning zones, a public communications document, a code of practice and
 a licensing regime for high-risk, single-well batteries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those plans were never adopted, a ministry statement confirms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Instead, the Ministry chose to take a risk-based approach to managing the sour <b>gas</b> issue that included increased field inspections and improved data collection." Eighteen wells that had been venting sour <b>gas</b> were ordered to be "shut-in" in 2012/2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 2013 to the summer 
of 2014, the ministry began implementing "an aggressive inspection and 
enforcement schedule to reduce sour <b>gas</b> emission" that included suspension orders against 30 facilities owing to "H2S management issues," the statement reads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During that effort, H2S would claim its most high-profile victim in Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Bunz, a salesman 
for Nalco Champion, died on May 22, 2014, while taking samples in a shed
 located in a provincial park between Carlyle and Kipling. A valve on 
the tank broke and oil, water and H2S spewed into his face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An incident report submitted by the tank's owner, <span class="companylink">Harvest Operations Corp</span>., states simply: "Spill occurred as a result of a failed valve."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nowhere does it mention Bunz's death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, his death is 
marked by a gravestone in a small cemetery near Wawota, where the father
 of two young daughters lived a few doors away from his parents, Dianne 
and Allan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The black, polished 
stone, with an image of Bunz wearing his Saskatchewan Roughriders jersey
 and hat, calls him "Bunzy" and reads: "In loving memory of Emma and 
Olivia's Daddy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He didn't really talk 
about those dangers," Dianne says. "We knew what it's like to work in 
the oil industry. My husband did for 20 years. We knew about H2S but I 
wasn't aware that he was going on site and doing the testing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The summer before he 
died, Allan drove his son to the Nalco office to quit. Michael's 
brother-in-law, who had worked there, had left and "things had been 
pretty tough," Michael said, marked by long days and heavy workload.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He was going to hand his
 company truck in, and his boss was there ... he talked (Michael) out of
 it," Allan says. "This company wanted him because he never ever phoned 
in sick or anything. He'd just go to work. And they offered him more 
money, so he stayed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nalco Champion is facing 
three charges under the province's occupational health and safety 
legislation for failing to provide Bunz with a respirator and to ensure 
he entered a dangerous situation with a second worker. A conviction 
would result in a fine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family says they were
 told by Nalco that the concentration of H2S in the fluids was estimated
 at 40,000 parts per million, more than enough to bring near-instant 
death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company sent reporters a written statement, declining further comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We remain deeply 
saddened by the loss of our colleague, Michael Bunz. The safety of our 
associates, customers and communities is vitally important, and we 
remain committed to our robust safety policies, protocols and training 
programs, which include those related to hydrogen sulfide," it reads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allan, who spent most of 
his working life in the oil industry, says he learned more about H2S 
protection when he worked on a pig farm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Every person had to wear
 an H2S monitor. And I'm talking about the pig industry," he says. "To 
me, they were protecting us ... more at this simple small hog operation 
in Saskatchewan than the oil industry ever did the entire time I was 
working out there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple reviewed the 
records documenting years of discussions between government and industry
 about public health risks and failed audits that were never made 
public. The couple called it "devastating."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I go to work every day 
and I drive down the highway and I talk to my son sitting beside me," 
says Allan. "I say to him "tough day there, son" and I tell him how I 
feel . . . I feel him sitting there beside me."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How often H2S incidents happen or happened in Saskatchewan remains a mystery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officially, ministry 
officials count one death and five "documented incidents where a member 
of the public was exposed to unsafe levels of sour <b>gas</b> near a well or facility site."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of them triggered a public statement by the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There was no need for public notification since the incident was quickly dealt with at the site," reads the ministry statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after dozens of 
interviews it is clear that H2S incidents involving residents are more 
common but go unreported or are not recorded properly. This is also true
 for workers in the oilfield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only months after Bunz 
died, Trina Hansen, an oilfield worker and part-time voice actress, was 
clearing a pipeline near Carlyle, Sask.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I could have died," she 
says. "It's almost like you could feel like a heavy air hit your face. 
It's a really weird feeling. Your first reaction is to inhale. When it 
hits your face, you breathe it in. It's the weirdest thing. You don't 
think to hold your breath. It happens so fast. I stumbled backwards. I 
was so shocked."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disoriented, Hansen got 
back in her truck and drove a couple of kilometres until she noticed she
 was losing her peripheral vision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There were white 
sparkles, iridescent, swirly, super-shiny and bright. I jumped out and 
started feeling nauseous and couldn't breathe very well. I was trying to
 catch my breath and dry heaving. My head started pounding."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hansen, suffering debilitating headaches, nausea and sickness, lost her voice for two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This happened three 
years ago and I still have a hard time catching my breath if I talk too 
fast. I'm very short of breath. I've never in my life felt like that. It
 was horrible."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her voice has changed for good - it is far deeper and lower than before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I do a cartoon on APTN 
network and they said my voice totally changed. It changed two octaves 
pretty much. It used to be high and now it cuts out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hansen never reported the incident, fearing she would lose her job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Nobody wants to say 
anything. We know it's bad and dangerous. But no one wants to raise a 
fuss. And being a woman and trying to prove yourself out there, I never 
claimed WCB (Workers Compensation Board). The economy went down and I 
have to pay off debt with my trucking money."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four months after Bunz's 
death, a secret ministry report listed 161 facilities "that may be in 
violation of (the ministry's) sour <b>gas</b> emission control."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The catch: "time and 
resources required to investigate and verify violations would take all 
available field officers over a year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2014, inspections of 
60 suspicious wells in 2014 turned up 36 - more than half - that were 
leaking so badly they had to be shut down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another audit found 11 
out of 12 facilities failed inspection "due to H2S venting" and found 29
 locations that are too close to facilities with high levels of H2S 
concentrations. Of the 1,352 active sour <b>gas</b> facilities, only 421 - 31 per cent - had "proper emission control systems."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Almost every site had improper <b>gas</b>
 measurement," the report reads. "Discovered major contamination at two 
facilities as a result of spill which were not reported" to the 
ministry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry believes 
that the H2S issue is under control, saying air quality standards are 
being met and that inspections confirm that companies' sour <b>gas</b> 
management practices have improved. Today 27 full-time inspectors are 
responsible for the province's 126,000 wells and its estimated 118,000 
kilometres of pipelines and flowlines, operating with a budget of $3.9 
million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2016-17, ministry staff inspected 18,340 wells, facilities and pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, a team of 
researchers from Harvard and Northeastern Universities collected data in
 collaboration with this investigation using the same instruments 
employed by ministry inspectors to detect emissions invisible to the 
naked eye.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In my experience measuring oil and <b>gas</b>
 activities in Texas, what struck me was that about a third of the sites
 we looked at had what we believed to be fugitive emissions and the high
 density of pump jacks," says Lourdes Vera, a doctoral student in 
environmental sociology at <span class="companylink">Northeastern University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Michanowicz, a 
post-doctoral researcher at Harvard University's School of Public Health
 who led the survey in Saskatchewan, said about one in five of the 
facilities they visited showed black smoke rising from the flaring 
stacks of production facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If there is black smoke,
 there is particulate matter that if inhaled is certainly associated 
with human health effects," he said. "If sources of these air pollutants
 are constantly impacting individuals where they live, work and play, 
there is the worry that they are experiencing health effects."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In interviews with 
landowners and records in the government database, this investigation 
has found recent H2S accidents, including three people who say they were
 sickened by H2S clouds near their homes in the past year. One said they
 required hospitalization after a near-fatal incident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, more than 
four years after the H2S incident in Galloway's front yard, she and her 
husband were driving home when they encountered a plume of what she 
believes was H2S <b>gas</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She fell ill and stayed home for three days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've had arrhythmias, really wicked headaches ... I've had bouts of nausea. I wake up at night and have heart palpitations."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Galloway wrote to public officials demanding a response.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were no 
consequences or fines as a result. And no official report of an incident
 anywhere near the Galloway property that day was filed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, says Galloway, is just the way it works in Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As a person living in 
the middle of the oilfield, you have no protection. The government 
doesn't care. Your MLA doesn't care. The oil companies don't care."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unprecedented Collaboration Behind the Project</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the past nine 
months, an unprecedented collaboration of more than 50 journalists and 
editors from three Canadian media outlets, four journalism schools and a
 think tank have worked to chronicle the hidden price of oil in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Collectively, reporters 
examined thousands of industry and government documents, analyzed 
terabytes of data and delved into dozens of freedom-of-information 
requests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The project started with
 the people," says Patti Sonntag, a managing editor in the New York 
Times' news services division, who launched the project with a grant 
from the Michener Awards Foundation. Following a tip from a colleague at
 the Corporate Mapping Project, she did some research and reporting in 
Saskatchewan last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working with the previous
 year's Michener winner, Toronto Star journalist Robert Cribb, Sonntag 
created a team of students at the Ryerson, Concordia and UBC journalism 
schools. <span class="companylink">Concordia University</span>'s Department of Journalism volunteered to act as host and headquarters for the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">University of Regina 
students reported on the ground locally, shot video and developed 
sources, while students at the other universities aggregated and 
analyzed data and interviewed experts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're pulling these four
 different schools from across the country and looking at it from all 
different aspects," says Janelle Blakley, a University of Regina student
 reporter whose team mapped spills data and met local farmers and 
residents. "This collaboration allowed us to really dig into it, where 
all schools were pulling apart different pieces of it and then coming 
back and putting it all together."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The significance of the 
data quickly drew intrigue. What emerged was a picture of a few 
dedicated regulators - and even some industry leaders - who tried to 
introduce greater accountability, but these efforts were ultimately 
overwhelmed by larger forces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You start to understand 
these figures really do play a huge role in dictating the direction of 
the Canadian economy and that plays out in the lives of everyday 
Canadians," says Lauren Kaljur, a graduate of UBC's master of journalism
 program who has been investigating the concentration of corporate power
 in Saskatchewan's oil and <b>gas</b> industry since the beginning of 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Matthew Gilmour, a recent journalism graduate at <span class="companylink">Concordia University</span>,
 after spending months populating spreadsheets and ledgers, "there's the
 human moment where you realize it's not just a pocketbook story. It's a
 human story. And people's lives are affected."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work continued past 
the end of the semester in April 2017, with students working alongside 
veteran reporters at the Star, the National Observer and Global News to 
shape the stories, seek comments from all sides and publish hundreds of 
pages of government and industry records, detailing concerns about 
potentially deadly <b>gas</b> emissions for the first time.&nbsp;- Steph Wechsler/ Ryerson School of Journalism</p>

Public safety is the number one priority, Saskatchewan government says after toxic <b>gas</b>

Saskatchewan has strengthened its sour <b>gas</b> monitoring[https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2017/10/05/saskatchewan-has-strengthened-its-sour-gas-monitoring.html]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Documents obtained 
through freedom-of-information requests and from whistleblowers — 
internal correspondence, meeting minutes, presentations and inspection 
reports — disclose findings of failures in performance by oil and <b>gas</b>
 companies, including serious infractions, failed safety audits, daily 
H2S readings beyond provincial air quality standards and a death in 
2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet regulatory standards remain largely unchanged and H2S incidents and risks remain hidden from the public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The teen overcome in Galloway's yard eventually recovered but missed school for several days with nausea and headaches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">H2S can be an insidious killer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heavier than air, it tends to settle in ravines and valleys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just above the level 
Galloway's monitor detected — 100 parts per million — H2S causes 
olfactory paralysis, leaving a victim unable to detect the rotten-egg 
smell. Continued exposure at that level may cause death within 48 hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A person exposed to a highly concentrated plume of the <b>gas</b>
 — at 1,000 parts per million — may die rapidly from respiratory 
paralysis, or over the course of days, from an inflammatory reaction in 
the lungs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Victims effectively suffocate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government issued no 
public warning after Galloway reported the plume at her home because 
“there was no evidence that this was a widespread failure.” But inside 
government and industry offices, documents indicate the seriousness of 
H2S issues that led to years of meetings, audits and proposed regulatory
 reforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On April 7, 2014, 
government and industry officials deliberated about releasing data that 
showed H2S “hotspots” across southeastern Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Government may be 
accused of hiding information,” the notes read. “Public will want to 
know: 1. What are the areas? 2. How is it managed? 3. How is the 
government making sure it's managed?” one unnamed official told the 
meeting. “Are we creating a risk by not releasing this data 
immediately?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite acknowledging 
“significant” public health risks from H2S, at least some officials 
present expressed concern about “sensitivity in this data (because) 
there are residents living in these areas.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No release followed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three weeks later, 
government-proposed fines for emission breaches — up to $1 million in 
penalties — were rejected by two major industry groups. In a letter to 
the ministry dated April 29, 2014, the <span class="companylink">Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) </span>and Explorers and Producers Association of Canada (EPAC) called the proposed penalties “unsuitable.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A former ministry 
official, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of losing his 
current job in the industry, says “almost every amendment was being 
rejected.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EPAC officials declined comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terry Abel, CAPP's 
spokesperson, said the letter was intended to explain that, “in some 
cases, fines aren't appropriate at all … If there's an unsafe operation,
 it should be shut down. It shouldn't be operating. That's the best way 
to ensure the public safety is protected.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed fines were dropped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next month, Michael Bunz, a 38-year-old salesman supplying chemicals to oil and <b>gas</b> facilities, lay in a shack 80 kilometres from the Galloway house, dead after being exposed to H2S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The official incident 
report filed with the Ministry of the Economy, which regulates 
Saskatchewan's oilfields, makes no mention of Bunz's death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These regulators “are 
really thinking about the economic health of the province,” says Emily 
Eaton, a professor at the University of Regina who has studied the 
relationship between the oil industry and the government. Eaton is a 
member of the Corporate Mapping Project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A shift in 2012 — from 
the Ministry of Energy and Resources to a new Ministry of the Economy 
tasked with regulating natural resource extraction and promoting 
economic development — changed the ministry's role from watchdog to 
partner, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They're thinking about 
returns on investment … The industry should really be regulated by those
 that have the interests of the environment first.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ministry field staff raised this concern at a meeting on July 1, 2015, between government and industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The role of the 
regulator needs to be adjusted,” the meeting's minutes read. “The 
regulators are acting as consultants in some situations. The role of the
 regulator is to enforce the rules and if the rules are clear and if 
enforcement is consistent and clear then, 'cultural' changes can be 
made.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its statement, the ministry rejects criticisms of conflict of interest or lax enforcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Within the Ministry of the Economy, the petroleum and natural <b>gas</b>
 division carries out industry regulation,” wrote the department's 
spokeswoman, Deb Young. “It is not involved in investment attraction, 
royalty and tax assessment and land sales. It is solely focused on well,
 facility and pipeline regulation.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That regulation has not included fines or prosecutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry has not 
issued a single fine against any industry company “for well over a 
decade,” Doug MacKnight, assistant deputy minister responsible for 
petroleum and natural <b>gas</b>, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Generally, we don't have
 to resort to that,” he said. “It's usually just a notice to the 
operator to bring themselves into compliance.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prosecutions have also 
not been part of the ministry's enforcement practices because 
non-compliance was dealt with “through other enforcement actions,” reads
 the ministry's statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other enforcement actions
 include increased inspections and staff, high-tech equipment for 
detecting emissions and a $69-million inspection reporting database 
(which can't be accessed by the public).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, complaints of illness from residents and workers continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I will sometimes get 
faint, like I will fall over and I have to find a seat quickly,” says 
Lori Erhardt, a United Church minister and musician living near Oxbow 
who believes her chronic illness is related to emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I have had a variety of 
diagnoses, most of them end with “i-t-i-s,” which means inflammation … 
If something gets inflamed, if it's blood vesicles, you feel it through 
your body.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the five years' 
worth of documents obtained by this investigation is an April 2012 
PowerPoint presentation to CAPP members by the director of the 
province's petroleum and natural <b>gas</b> division. It includes a map of southeastern Saskatchewan showing a bloom of red and orange circles, labelled “critical sour <b>gas</b> locations.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sources say ministry 
staff pushed to make the data public but senior government officials 
said “there's no goddamn way that is going to be released,” according to
 the former ministry source.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's an institutional
 reluctance to make this information public,” he said. “The public 
should be able to see all the information that legislators have 
identified as public information such as sour <b>gas</b> and inspection reports.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry statement 
says the map was never approved for release because some data was out of
 date, not comprehensive and “could provide the public and industry with
 a false understanding of risk associated with a particular well or 
facility.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the Galloway incident, the ministry inspected 11 oil and <b>gas</b>
 facilities. All failed “with serious infractions,” including releasing 
H2S at lethal levels “that may be exceeding 150,000 (parts per 
million),” Brad Herald, CAPP's Saskatchewan operations manager, wrote to
 the board of governors in December 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those levels are 150 times the amount that could cause instant death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the causes: “It is 
believed that inadequate training on the installation and operation of 
equipment is … contributing to the air quality issues.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPP's Abel said in an interview the “unsafe” facilities responsible for those breaches should not have been operating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They should have been shut down,” he said. “When you follow the rules, processing and production of sour <b>gas</b>
 is absolutely safe. If you don't follow the rules, it can pose a health
 risk. So ultimately, those operators at those facilities were 
responsible.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither CAPP nor its industry partners made the health risks public. And no ministry fines or prosecutions followed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Internally, CAPP quickly mobilized to develop a public relations and damage control plan:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are growing public
 concerns regarding the air quality issues in southeast Saskatchewan,” 
Herald wrote, noting a petition and a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The Ministry fields one 
to two public complaints concerning odours per week and the issue is 
garnering increasing political attention . . . This has the potential to
 become a broader industry reputation/<b>social license</b> concern and 
warrants immediate attention by operators in the region . . . 
Communications is preparing key messages in the event that there is 
media profile.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPP received a warning 
the next month after consulting a scientist with expertise on managing 
toxic substances, internal emails show. The scientist expressed 
disappointment noting that H2S failures were “so easy to avoid.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientist urged the 
industry lobby group to develop and implement a new code of practice to 
control dangerous emissions and get ahead of the problem by publicly 
denouncing unacceptable practices. The scientist also recommended that 
the industry group pressure the province to step up inspections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry, in meetings with industry, proposed similar reforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter sent in March
 2013 then-energy minister Tim McMillan — now president and CEO of CAPP —
 warned companies to meet “compliance obligations” or face “escalated 
enforcement, penalty and/or prosecution.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ministry and industry met
 four times between 2012 and 2014 to plot strategy, including emergency 
planning zones, a public communications document, a code of practice and
 a licensing regime for high-risk, single-well batteries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those plans were never adopted, a ministry statement confirms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Instead, the Ministry chose to take a risk-based approach to managing the sour <b>gas</b> issue that included increased field inspections and improved data collection.” Eighteen wells that had been venting sour <b>gas</b> were ordered to be “shut-in” in 2012/2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 2013 to the summer 
of 2014, the ministry began implementing “an aggressive inspection and 
enforcement schedule to reduce sour <b>gas</b> emission” that included suspension orders against 30 facilities owing to “H2S management issues,” the statement reads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During that effort, H2S would claim its most high-profile victim in Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Bunz, a salesman 
for Nalco Champion, died on May 22, 2014, while taking samples in a shed
 located in a provincial park between Carlyle and Kipling. A valve on 
the tank broke and oil, water and H2S spewed into his face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An incident report submitted by the tank's owner, <span class="companylink">Harvest Operations Corp</span>., states simply: “Spill occurred as a result of a failed valve.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nowhere does it mention Bunz's death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, his death is 
marked by a gravestone in a small cemetery near Wawota, where the father
 of two young daughters lived a few doors away from his parents, Dianne 
and Allan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The black, polished 
stone, with an image of Bunz wearing his Saskatchewan Roughriders jersey
 and hat, calls him “Bunzy” and reads: “In loving memory of Emma and 
Olivia's Daddy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He didn't really talk 
about those dangers,” Dianne says. “We knew what it's like to work in 
the oil industry. My husband did for 20 years. We knew about H2S but I 
wasn't aware that he was going on site and doing the testing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The summer before he 
died, Allan drove his son to the Nalco office to quit. Michael's 
brother-in-law, who had worked there, had left and “things had been 
pretty tough,” Michael said, marked by long days and heavy workload.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He was going to hand his
 company truck in, and his boss was there … he talked (Michael) out of 
it,” Allan says. “This company wanted him because he never ever phoned 
in sick or anything. He'd just go to work. And they offered him more 
money, so he stayed.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nalco Champion is facing 
three charges under the province's occupational health and safety 
legislation for failing to provide Bunz with a respirator and to ensure 
he entered a dangerous situation with a second worker. A conviction 
would result in a fine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family says they were
 told by Nalco that the concentration of H2S in the fluids was estimated
 at 40,000 parts per million, more than enough to bring near-instant 
death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company sent reporters a written statement, declining further comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We remain deeply 
saddened by the loss of our colleague, Michael Bunz. The safety of our 
associates, customers and communities is vitally important, and we 
remain committed to our robust safety policies, protocols and training 
programs, which include those related to hydrogen sulfide,” it reads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allan, who spent most of 
his working life in the oil industry, says he learned more about H2S 
protection when he worked on a pig farm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Every person had to wear
 an H2S monitor. And I'm talking about the pig industry,” he says. “To 
me, they were protecting us … more at this simple small hog operation in
 Saskatchewan than the oil industry ever did the entire time I was 
working out there.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple reviewed the 
records documenting years of discussions between government and industry
 about public health risks and failed audits that were never made 
public. The couple called it “devastating.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I go to work every day 
and I drive down the highway and I talk to my son sitting beside me,” 
says Allan. “I say to him “tough day there, son” and I tell him how I 
feel . . . I feel him sitting there beside me.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How often H2S incidents happen or happened in Saskatchewan remains a mystery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officially, ministry 
officials count one death and five “documented incidents where a member 
of the public was exposed to unsafe levels of sour <b>gas</b> near a well or facility site.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of them triggered a public statement by the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There was no need for public notification since the incident was quickly dealt with at the site,” reads the ministry statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after dozens of 
interviews it is clear that H2S incidents involving residents are more 
common but go unreported or are not recorded properly. This is also true
 for workers in the oilfield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only months after Bunz 
died, Trina Hansen, an oilfield worker and part-time voice actress, was 
clearing a pipeline near Carlyle, Sask.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I could have died,” she 
says. “It's almost like you could feel like a heavy air hit your face. 
It's a really weird feeling. Your first reaction is to inhale. When it 
hits your face, you breathe it in. It's the weirdest thing. You don't 
think to hold your breath. It happens so fast. I stumbled backwards. I 
was so shocked.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disoriented, Hansen got 
back in her truck and drove a couple of kilometres until she noticed she
 was losing her peripheral vision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There were white 
sparkles, iridescent, swirly, super-shiny and bright. I jumped out and 
started feeling nauseous and couldn't breathe very well. I was trying to
 catch my breath and dry heaving. My head started pounding.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hansen, suffering debilitating headaches, nausea and sickness, lost her voice for two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This happened three 
years ago and I still have a hard time catching my breath if I talk too 
fast. I'm very short of breath. I've never in my life felt like that. It
 was horrible.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her voice has changed for good — it is far deeper and lower than before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I do a cartoon on <span class="companylink">APTN</span> network and they said my voice totally changed. It changed two octaves pretty much. It used to be high and now it cuts out.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hansen never reported the incident, fearing she would lose her job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Nobody wants to say 
anything. We know it's bad and dangerous. But no one wants to raise a 
fuss. And being a woman and trying to prove yourself out there, I never 
claimed WCB (Workers Compensation Board). The economy went down and I 
have to pay off debt with my trucking money.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four months after Bunz's 
death, a secret ministry report listed 161 facilities “that may be in 
violation of (the ministry's) sour <b>gas</b> emission control.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The catch: “time and 
resources required to investigate and verify violations would take all 
available field officers over a year.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2014, inspections of 
60 suspicious wells in 2014 turned up 36 — more than half — that were 
leaking so badly they had to be shut down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another audit found 11 
out of 12 facilities failed inspection “due to H2S venting” and found 29
 locations that are too close to facilities with high levels of H2S 
concentrations. Of the 1,352 active sour <b>gas</b> facilities, only 421 — 31 per cent — had “proper emission control systems.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Almost every site had improper <b>gas</b>
 measurement,” the report reads. “Discovered major contamination at two 
facilities as a result of spill which were not reported” to the 
ministry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry believes 
that the H2S issue is under control, saying air quality standards are 
being met and that inspections confirm that companies' sour <b>gas</b> 
management practices have improved. Today 27 full-time inspectors are 
responsible for the province's 126,000 wells and its estimated 118,000 
kilometres of pipelines and flowlines, operating with a budget of $3.9 
million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2016-17, ministry staff inspected 18,340 wells, facilities and pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, a team of 
researchers from Harvard and Northeastern Universities collected data in
 collaboration with this investigation using the same instruments 
employed by ministry inspectors to detect emissions invisible to the 
naked eye.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In my experience measuring oil and <b>gas</b>
 activities in Texas, what struck me was that about a third of the sites
 we looked at had what we believed to be fugitive emissions and the high
 density of pump jacks,” says Lourdes Vera, a doctoral student in 
environmental sociology at <span class="companylink">Northeastern University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Michanowicz, a 
post-doctoral researcher at Harvard University's School of Public Health
 who led the survey in Saskatchewan, said about one in five of the 
facilities they visited showed black smoke rising from the flaring 
stacks of production facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If there is black smoke,
 there is particulate matter that if inhaled is certainly associated 
with human health effects,” he said. “If sources of these air pollutants
 are constantly impacting individuals where they live, work and play, 
there is the worry that they are experiencing health effects.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In interviews with 
landowners and records in the government database, this investigation 
has found recent H2S accidents, including three people who say they were
 sickened by H2S clouds near their homes in the past year. One said they
 required hospitalization after a near-fatal incident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, more than 
four years after the H2S incident in Galloway's front yard, she and her 
husband were driving home when they encountered a plume of what she 
believes was H2S <b>gas</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She fell ill and stayed home for three days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I've had arrhythmias, really wicked headaches … I've had bouts of nausea. I wake up at night and have heart palpitations.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Galloway wrote to public officials demanding a response.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were no 
consequences or fines as a result. And no official report of an incident
 anywhere near the Galloway property that day was filed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, says Galloway, is just the way it works in Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As a person living in 
the middle of the oilfield, you have no protection. The government 
doesn't care. Your MLA doesn't care. The oil companies don't care.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unprecedented Collaboration Behind the Project</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the past nine 
months, an unprecedented collaboration of more than 50 journalists and 
editors from three Canadian media outlets, four journalism schools and a
 think tank have worked to chronicle the hidden price of oil in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Collectively, reporters 
examined thousands of industry and government documents, analyzed 
terabytes of data and delved into dozens of freedom-of-information 
requests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The project started with the people,” says Patti Sonntag, a managing editor in the <span class="companylink">New York Times</span>'
 news services division, who launched the project with a grant from the 
Michener Awards Foundation. Following a tip from a colleague at the 
Corporate Mapping Project, she did some research and reporting in 
Saskatchewan last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working with the previous
 year's Michener winner, Toronto Star journalist Robert Cribb, Sonntag 
created a team of students at the Ryerson, Concordia and UBC journalism 
schools. <span class="companylink">Concordia University</span>'s Department of Journalism volunteered to act as host and headquarters for the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">University of Regina 
students reported on the ground locally, shot video and developed 
sources, while students at the other universities aggregated and 
analyzed data and interviewed experts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're pulling these four
 different schools from across the country and looking at it from all 
different aspects,” says Janelle Blakley, a University of Regina student
 reporter whose team mapped spills data and met local farmers and 
residents. “This collaboration allowed us to really dig into it, where 
all schools were pulling apart different pieces of it and then coming 
back and putting it all together.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The significance of the 
data quickly drew intrigue. What emerged was a picture of a few 
dedicated regulators — and even some industry leaders — who tried to 
introduce greater accountability, but these efforts were ultimately 
overwhelmed by larger forces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You start to understand 
these figures really do play a huge role in dictating the direction of 
the Canadian economy and that plays out in the lives of everyday 
Canadians,” says Lauren Kaljur, a graduate of UBC's master of journalism
 program who has been investigating the concentration of corporate power
 in Saskatchewan's oil and <b>gas</b> industry since the beginning of 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Matthew Gilmour, a recent journalism graduate at <span class="companylink">Concordia University</span>,
 after spending months populating spreadsheets and ledgers, “there's the
 human moment where you realize it's not just a pocketbook story. It's a
 human story. And people's lives are affected.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work continued past 
the end of the semester in April 2017, with students working alongside 
veteran reporters at the Star, the National Observer and Global News to 
shape the stories, seek comments from all sides and publish hundreds of 
pages of government and industry records, detailing concerns about 
potentially deadly <b>gas</b> emissions for the first time. — Steph Wechsler/ Ryerson School of Journalism</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Alberta opts for a 
Conservative premier in 2019, the rest of Canada should brace itself for
 for an era of constitutional wrangling and inter-provincial conflict 
unseen since the 1970s.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All
 four potential leaders of the newly formed United Conservative Party - 
the product of a union between the province's Progressive Conservative 
and Wildrose parties, and the most likely threat to NDP premier Rachel 
Notley's reelection - have spent the campaign to date taking hard lines 
on trade, taxes and everything Ottawa. During the first debate between 
leadership candidates last week, a packed hall of revitalized provincial
 conservative die-hards cheered loudest when the candidates promised 
trade wars and constitutional legal battles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Responding to a question 
about the beleaguered Trans Mountain Pipeline, for example - which 
B.C.'s new NDP government has vowed to oppose - Calgary lawyer and 
would-be UCP leader Doug Schweitzer threatened to kick B.C. out of the 
New West Partnership Trade Agreement, and bellowed: "Our economy is 
stronger than B.C's. If they want to get into a trade war, bring it on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former MP and federal 
cabinet minister Jason Kenney, the race's front-runner, and former 
Wildrose leader Brian Jean have also proposed using an arcane <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>
 ruling to force a re-negotiation of the federal equalization program, 
which transfers money to "have-not" provinces with the intention of 
assuring equal levels of government services across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Alberta continues to 
suffer an oil-bust economic downturn, a Conservative premier would 
rankle much of the rest of Confederation on behalf of a province 
increasingly embittered by pipeline politics. It's the kind of muscular 
approach employed by premiers like Peter Lougheed and Ralph Klein, both 
of whom maintain a kind of mythical status in Alberta for their 
willingness to square off against Ottawa and the other provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's certainly an 
opportunity for a Conservative Albertan to flex his or her muscles. The 
environmental movement is intractably opposed to the development of 
Alberta's oil sands, opposition from other premiers to pipelines like 
Trans Mountain and Energy East threaten Alberta's ability to sell its 
oil in the U.S. and abroad. Meanwhile, under Justin Trudeau, the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span> has expanded its mandate, stating that it will consider both upstream and downstream greenhouse <b>gas</b> emissions as part of the regulatory process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If B.C., Ontario and 
Quebec continue to oppose pipeline construction, and the federal 
government proves unwilling to use its powers to make the projects 
happen, there is little reason for Albertans to play nice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The change at the <span class="companylink">NEB</span> was sold as a bid to gain the kind of "<b>social license</b>"
 necessary to earn Alberta's oil industry the good will to expand; 
current NDP premier Rachel Notley has also invested in this more 
conciliatory approach, adopting a hard cap on greenhouse <b>gas</b> emissions in the oil sands and introducing a carbon tax. But from the Conservative point of view, the quest for <b>social license</b>
 has proved fruitless; if B.C., Ontario and Quebec continue to oppose 
pipeline construction, and the federal government proves unwilling to 
use its powers to make the projects happen, there is little reason for 
Albertans to play nice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that is where Kenney and Jean's constitutional threats come into play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In 1998, the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>
 made a decision in what is called the Quebec Succession reference in 
which it determined that if a province holds a referendum on a 
constitutional question and if it is adopted by a clear majority on a 
clear question, there is a binding constitutional obligation on the 
federal government to negotiate that issue with the relevant province," 
Kenney said after last week's debate. "If the federal government pursues
 a tax on our energy industry - the carbon tax - if it doesn't roll back
 the <span class="companylink">NEB</span>'s outrageous expansion of its 
mandate, and if it refuses to fundamentally change the equalization 
formula in 2019 I would be prepared to hold a referendum."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to several 
legal experts, this is no mere idle threat. But constitutional law is 
more complicated than soundbites allow, and the real question is whether
 triggering such a referendum would amount to anything more than a 
temporary legal headache for the federal government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To craft this proposal, 
Kenney relied on a paper published by retired University of Calgary 
political science professor and former Alberta cabinet minister Ted 
Morton, who said a referendum would likely force the federal government 
to negotiate on a constitutional issue in good faith. However, Morton 
concedes, a negotiation doesn't mean that that Ottawa would be forced to
 cede any of Alberta's demands; additionally, any actual changes to the 
constitution would require the support of seven provinces containing 50 
per cent of the population, as per the amending formula.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It would be a chance for
 those arguments to be put on the table, and who knows. Justin Trudeau 
might see opportunities for some reform," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the principle of 
equalization is enshrined in the constitution, the actual formula by 
which the transfer is calculated is a matter of federal legislation, and
 one that is up for review in 2019. The mere threat of a constitutional 
renegotiation might be enough to earn Alberta some concessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first debate: The 
four men vying to lead Alberta's new United Conservative Party( 
http://nationalpost.com/news/politics/four-candidates-vying-to-lead-new-alberta-party-to-face-off-in-first-debate[http://nationalpost.com/news/politics/four-candidates-vying-to-lead-new-alberta-party-to-face-off-in-first-debate]
 )</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Ivison: Trudeau's 
Liberals have kept all the pipeline promises they intended to keep(

 )</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if it did, however, 
University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe warns that there is no 
likely new equalization formula that would make any substantive 
improvements to the red ink on Alberta's balance sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if Alberta were able
 to exclude resource revenue from the equalization equation, "we have 
the highest level of fiscal capacity of any province," Tombe said. "I 
think there's lots of sensible changes that could be made, but Albertans
 shouldn't be under the illusion that it would improve our own fiscal 
situation. Changing the formula affects how equalization funds are 
allocated among have-not provinces, and we are not going to be a have 
not province."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short, all this 
bluster from Conservative candidates would likely amount to little more 
than political theatre. But what theatre it could be.</p>

<span class="companylink">Petrolympic Ltd</span>. ("Petrolympic" or the 
"Company") (TSX.V: PCQ, OTCQB: PCQRF) acknowledges that an important 
mile step has been accomplished by the Ministry of Energy and Natural 
Resources of Quebec who published, on Sept. 20, 2017, the draft 
regulations to govern oil and natural <b>gas</b> activities.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Petrolympic
 considers that the Quebec government is sending a strong message in 
releasing these regulations, confirming its will to strengthen the 
economic dynamism of the province in the absolute respect of the 
environment and of the local stakeholders, through the development of a 
robust oil and <b>gas</b> industry. These regulations will govern and 
clarify the exploration, production and storage licencing processes, the
 field activities on land and water environments (to the exclusion of 
the offshore marine environment), as well as pipeline constructions. In 
particular, they are intended to improve the synchronicity between the 
different ministries so as to homogenize the regulatory framework, to 
facilitate the coordination with the municipalities so as to account for
 the different uses of the land, and to improve the collaboration and 
the cooperation with the local stakeholders so as to achieve social 
acceptability faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The preparation of these 
regulations capitalizes on a series of in-depth reviews undertaken by 
the government of Quebec over the past few years and it reflects a very 
modern view of the industry best practices. The regulations aim at 
facilitating and accelerating the exploration and production of 
hydrocarbons in Quebec while enforcing very high industrial and 
professional standards for the safety of environment, persons and 
properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A period of forty-five 
days is allowed for comments and recommendations from the civil society,
 during which Petrolympic will carefully review the draft regulations 
and provide feed-backs to the government if appropriate. The government 
will then be able to implement the regulations, thus triggering the 
enactment of the Hydrocarbons Law. In parallel, the Ministry of 
Environment of Quebec is pursuing the review and update of its current 
regulation on water protection, a section of which providing 
complementary regulation to oil and natural <b>gas</b> industrial activities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Petrolympic CEO Mendel 
Ekstein commented: "As Petrolympic is moving forward to develop its 
diversified assets in Quebec, it is reassuring to see that we can grow 
and evolve in an environment defined by a set of modern and sensible 
laws and regulations. We are looking forward to collaborate with the 
government to put these regulations in practice in a very near future."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Management is confident 
that developing local hydrocarbon resources is a positive step for the 
Province, as it will balance Quebec's energy portfolio and strengthen 
its economy, while reducing the energy import deficit. Petrolympic is 
fully committed to securing and maintaining the <b>social license</b> 
and local support for its operations. Petrolympic seeks the orderly and 
responsible commercial development of its Quebec oil and <b>gas</b> exploration licenses, within the framework of the new Act and the new regulations.</p>

TransCanada. "The (company's) commercial group will decide about new 
pipeline construction."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Koles said pipeline 
companies have generally been reluctant to be the first to adopt new 
technologies, opting to wait until the tools or methods are proven 
before joining the bandwagon. Having large players on board for a pilot 
could give the small firm some leverage, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're not well known 
for adopting new innovation," Koles said, adding there are good reasons 
for this "very conservative, very safe" approach. "As a result, it 
becomes a little challenging on trying to sell innovation into something
 like a pipeline company."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hifi's expansion efforts 
are focused on new pipelines and retrofits of existing ones, especially 
in sensitive areas such as river crossings, spots where erosion is a 
concern and locations of previous spills.</p>

<span class="companylink">Inter Pipeline Ltd</span>.’s (IPL-T) stock has “significantly” underperformed this year and is now “attractively” valued, according to <span class="companylink">BMO</span>
 Nesbitt Burns analyst Ben Pham.Blaming the dip on concerns about its 
future growth and increased commodity price exposure alongside “weak” 
second-quarter results, he raised his rating for the Calgary-based 
company to “outperform” from “market perform” in a research note on the 
energy infrastructure industry.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“With
 NGL Processing cash flow poised to rebound in the second half of 2017 
following planned outages in Q2 and supported by higher frac spreads 
over the next year, the recent share price weakness provides for a great
 long-term investment opportunity, in our view,” said Mr. Pham. “Coupled
 with an attractive 24-per-cent upside to our unchanged target price of 
$27 including a 7-per-cent dividend yield (70-per-cent payout), we are 
upgrading our rating.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pham said the company’s NGL (natural <b>gas</b>
 liquids) processing appears set to grow going forward, with the 
acquisition of Williams Canada last year bolstering its processing 
footprint. “OPL is now benefitting from the same positive trends driving
 NGL levered names like KEY [<span class="companylink">Keyera Corp</span>.] and <span class="companylink">PPL</span> [<span class="companylink">Pembina Pipeline Corp</span>.],
 namely due to the increase in liquids-rich drilling and NGL 
production,” he said. “One opportunity is the proposed $3.1-billion PDH +
 PP [[propane dehydrogenation and polypropylene] &nbsp;project, where 
FID is expected H2/17 ($2 per share of potential upside), while another 
is the potential increase in frac spreads that would benefit existing 
operations. The Cochrane facility should also return to strong 
utilization following a planned outage in Q2. The unfortunate 
consequence of the NGL business is the increase in commodity exposure it
 comes with: to 18-per-cent year-to-date 2017 versus 10 per cent in 
2016. While the higher commodity exposure could continue to weigh on 
valuation, we think it will be contained and highly reliable cash flow 
in Oil Sands Pipes should offset. “As NGL processing adds to cash flow 
in the near term, opportunities related to intra-Alberta oil sands 
projects could arise in the medium term. Last year, IPL announced a new 
TOP contact for the Kirby North project; $125-million is expected to be 
invested at attractive returns. We believe this announcement illustrates
 that IPL still has considerable hidden value in the expansion potential
 of its oil sands/diluent pipelines. About $4-billion of potential 
investment has been identified and is not reflected in our model.”Mr. 
Pham maintained a price target of $27 for Inter Pipeline shares. The 
analyst consensus price target is $29.31, according to <span class="companylink">Thomson Reuters</span>
 data.“IPL shares are down 19 per cent versus a 3-per-cent decline for 
the group on a slowdown in dividend growth (we model for 4 per cent in 
2018) and higher commodity exposure,” he said. “IPL now trades at a 
discount compared to its historical premium: 2018 estimated enterprise 
value/EBITDA has compressed to 12.5 times from 14.0 times since the 
beginning of the year, while the 2018 estimated FCF [free cash flow] 
yield has risen to 9.5 per cent from 8 per cent. We believe the 
company's assets deserve a premium multiple given their long-life nature
 with creditworthy counterparties.”On the industry as a whole, Mr. Pham 
said he's shifting his preference to pipelines over utilities, noting: 
"Following a review of our Energy Infrastructure Top-Down Investment 
Framework, we have shifted our investment preference towards pipeline 
&amp; midstream equities over power &amp; utility within Canadian Energy
 Infrastructure. Why? (1) Midstream has significantly underperformed 
utilities this year and the sector is now trading at an attractive 
9-per-cent FCF yield vs. the historical five-year average of 8%. In 
contrast, utility names are trading at a 7-per-cent FCF yield, which is 
generally in line with its five-year historical average. (2) pipeline 
stocks offer higher dividend growth; and (3) we believe the combination 
of rising bond yields and a range-bound oil price is more positive for 
pipeline than the utility portion of our infrastructure coverage."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pham also upgraded his rating for <span class="companylink">Keyera Corp</span>.
 (KEY-T) based on its “robust” growth pipeline and “attractive 
valuation.”“Given the downdraft in Canada's midstream sector lately, we 
are becoming more bullish on the stocks generally,” he said. “KEY is 
perhaps a riskier proposition than most due to its <b>gas</b> processing
 throughput risk and Marketing volatility. Having said that, the stock 
has gone nowhere over the last two years and now trades at a modest 
discount to the group vs. a historical premium. We think cash flow per 
share should accelerate next year and the 16-per-cent implied upside to 
our unchanged $42 target is attractive. Accordingly, we are upgrading 
the shares to Outperform from Market Perform.”Mr. Pham admitted he 
recently saw limited upside for Keyera shares due to a number of 
factors, including a drop in <b>gas</b> processing throughput, “heightened” counterparty risk, downside in market profit and midstream fee compressions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Those risks have mostly 
surfaced now and are more than reflected in the share price, in our 
opinion,” he said. “Marketing delivered $23-million EBITDA in Q2/17 
versus $60-90-million per quarter in 2015, <b>gas</b> processing 
throughput saw 5-10-per-cent declines in 2015 and 2016, and frac fees 
have come under pressure due to the infrastructure over-build. As a 
result, the stock has gone nowhere over the last two years, while sector
 values have risen, with most midstream stocks up 15-20 per cent over 
that similar period. “Given that relative performance, the stock is 
trading at a discount on 2018 estimated FCF yield (9.2 per cent versus 
the pipeline/midstream average of 8.8 per cent). Historically, KEY 
garnered a premium to the group due to strong management, a conservative
 balance sheet, and a premium organic growth outlook. Robust Marketing 
profit during 2014-2015 probably also drove valuations higher than they 
would normally go on infrastructure growth alone.”His target remains 
$42. Consensus is $44.27.=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Falco Resources Ltd</span>.’s (FPC-X) Horne 5 
project is “to be advanced to production or be attractive as a potential
 acquisition target given the rarity of large scale, long life, and low 
cost projects in safe jurisdictions,” according to Raymond James analyst
 Tara Hassan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initiating coverage of 
the stock with an “outperform” rating, Ms. Hassan said Horne 5, located 
in Rouyn-Noranda, Que., stands out from its development stage peers 
based on its potential scale in production as well as its low cost 
profile and extended mine life. Falco owns the entire stake in the 
project, previously mined by <span class="companylink">Noranda Mines Ltd</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The project’s proximity 
to a mining centre eliminates many of the challenges that can face a 
development project as Horne 5 is easily accessible, has power and water
 to site, proximity to equipment suppliers, and access to a highly 
skilled labour pool,” the analyst said. “With the project being located 
on a brownfield site and in an active industrial area, permitting risks 
are perceived to be low, particularly given that the bulk of the 
tailings will be placed underground as paste fill or at other past 
producing operations on its claims. We note that Falco will need to add a
 surface tailings facility for the material it does not return 
underground; however, it is in talks to acquire a brownfield site that 
it could expand for its needs. It is also in discussions to acquire 
surface rights in two areas that it will require for surface 
infrastructure. The areas that it is looking to acquire will necessitate
 relocation of a school and an administrative building. We expect these 
discussions to conclude in 4Q17.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added: “The PEA 
outlined average annual production of 236,000 ounces Au at AISC of $427 
(U.S.) per ounce (net of by-products) over a 12 year mine life. This 
pegs Horne 5 in the top 10 Canadian development projects (with a 
published study) on an annual production basis and in the bottom two on a
 cash cost basis. When evaluating development projects not held by a 
major or intermediate producer, Horne 5 ranks in the top 3 Canadian 
development projects on a production basis.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hassan also emphasized the advantages stemming from Falco’s experienced management team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“One of the biggest 
challenges facing many development stage companies is establishing the 
team with the right skillsets and experience to carry the project 
through to production,” she said. “When a project the scale of Horne 5 
is proposed, we view this to be a bigger challenge as there are 
generally limited people available with the relevant experience building
 a project of that scale. In the case of Falco however, we believe it is
 uniquely positioned as it already has this team in place. The 
management team and Board of Directors behind Falco include many of the 
major players involved in designing, permitting, constructing, and 
operating the Canadian Malartic mine, one of Canada’s largest gold 
mines. With relevant recent experience in the region and with a large 
scale, high capital cost project, we believe the Falco team is well 
positioned to advance Horne 5 to production. While building a mine of 
the proposed scale of Horne 5 introduces unique technical complexities, 
the Falco team has encountered many of the same challenges in building 
the Canadian Malartic mine and are thus well positioned to address these
 challenges at Horne 5 and ensure risks remain low during the 
construction and operating phases. The common elements between the 
projects include the financing of a large scale, high capital cost 
project and advancing the project through the permitting process in the 
same jurisdiction. Unlike at Canadian Malartic, however, the Horne 5 
project is situated in a heavily used industrial area and is on a 
brownfield site, which we believe will simplify the permitting and <b>social license</b> components of the project.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hassan set a price target for the stock of $2. The analyst consensus price target is $1.91, according to <span class="companylink">Thomson Reuters</span> data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois expects <span class="companylink">Tesla Inc</span>.
 (TSLA-Q) to post losses until 2020, a year longer than the consensus 
projection on the Street. He believes the company’s vertically 
integrated business model (from manufacturing to distribution and 
supercharging) cannot become profitable as quickly as his peers expect 
or valuation multiples imply. Mr. Houchois initiated coverage of the 
stock with an “underperform” rating and $280 (U.S.) price target, which 
implies 27-per-cent downside from Monday’s close. The average target is 
$333.78. "Given capital intensity, we don't think DCF can justify the 
current valuation, let alone upside," said Mr. Houchois. "We appreciate 
the growth upside from a brand whose reach goes well beyond auto markets
 and that valuing Tesla today assumes some form of 'steady-state' that 
is unlikely to happen anytime soon."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though RBC Dominion Securities analyst Gary Bisbee believes there's "some" value in <span class="companylink">Equifax Inc</span>.
 (EFX-N) for patient, risk-tolerant investors, he said there's no rush 
as financial estimates for the scandal-ridden company need to fall and 
negative news could stem from Congressional hearings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wake of a 
34-per-cent drop in share price following the Sept. 8 disclosure of a 
data breach, Mr. Bisbee said "uncertainty remains high" and pointed to 
three lingering questions for investors: "1) How will the underlying 
earnings power of <span class="companylink">Equifax</span> be impacted 
by the breach?; 2) What risk of market share losses to competitors 
exists as fallout from the breach continues?; 3) Is there risk of 
tightened regulations or new legislation that “changes the rules” for 
the credit bureaus and hurts their profitability or growth prospects?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bisbee reduced his 2018 revenue forecast for <span class="companylink">Equifax</span>
 by 3.1 per cent and his earnings per share expectation by 11 per cent 
(to $5.96 from $6.68). His GAAP EPS estimate fell 37 per cent to $3.55 
from $5.68 including direct breach-related costs and estimated insurance
 recoveries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Clearly we have made 
many assumptions that could prove to be wrong, though we believe that 
they are reasonable under the circumstances and given what we know,” he 
said. “On the negative front, it is possible that providing monitoring 
to consumers could cost far more than our $260-million forecast, 
depending on the number of consumers that sign up or the cost to provide
 the service. And, we have not assumed any regulatory fines or legal 
settlements or judgements, though both are possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“On the positive front, 
insurance coverage could be larger, and we may have been too punitive in
 assuming that there is no cost reduction to partially offset the Global
 Consumer revenue decline (we don’t assume this because the business 
will likely actually be staffing up to provide the free monitoring to 
the much larger number of consumers getting free monitoring). We also 
may be double counting somewhat by assuming no cost takeout in Global 
Consumer while assuming that the monitoring costs (including <span class="companylink">Equifax</span>’s own costs) are fully in the model in the breach-related line.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He maintained an 
“outperform” rating for the stock and dropped his target to $113 (U.S.) 
from $154. The analyst average is $124, according to Bloomberg</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have been conditioned to recommend buying <span class="companylink">Equifax</span>
 on weakness (January-February 2016, October-November 2016), and that 
may well be the right approach here,” the analyst said. “However, there 
remains significant uncertainty into the costs and potential 
repercussions of the breach, and <span class="companylink">Equifax</span>
 will likely suffer in the court of public opinion in the short term. We
 also see little to be excited about in the near-term financial picture,
 as <span class="companylink">Equifax</span> faces USIS deceleration in 
H2/17 as mortgage refinancing volumes fall and it laps the US mortgage 
industry’s adoption of trended data last summer. Estimates need to fall 
(consensus 2018 adjusted EPS is 8 per cent above our new $5.96 
estimate). Add in some ACA uncertainty, tough comps through Q1/18 and 
likely lingering uncertainty about the financial and operational impact 
of the breach, and we see few potential short-term catalysts to drive a 
rebound in the shares, especially heading into what will likely be a 
difficult Congressional hearing on Oct. 3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Despite this challenging
 near-term outlook, we retain our Outperform rating, as we believe that 
current levels offer value for patient, risk-tolerant investors. We 
continue to believe in the quality of the management team and business 
model, and we believe that the franchise will work through this issue 
and continue to be a good (likely above average) compounder over time. 
However, in the short term we see no rush to step in to the stock, and 
prefer other recommended stocks where the risk side of risk-reward is 
more quantifiable.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citing its “attractive” real estate positioning, Credit Suisse analyst Christian Buss raised his rating for <span class="companylink">Gap Inc</span>. (GPS-N) to “neutral” from “underperform.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upgrade stems from 
Mr. Buss’s analysis of real estate for 32 softline vending and retail 
companies. He examined companies across eight “key criteria of retail 
health.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The biggest surprise in our analysis was <span class="companylink">The Gap Inc</span>.'s
 top 10 score,” he said. “GPS scored 57.1 per cent versus the group 
average of 50 per cent, and well above other mall-based specialty retail
 companies (LB [<span class="companylink">L Brands Inc</span>.] 50 per cent, ANF [<span class="companylink">Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co</span>.]
 50 per cent, and KORS [Michael Kors Holding Ltd.] 43.8 per cent). GPS 
pulled ahead by scoring higher in the mall exposure and mall quality 
categories.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Buss also said he was
 “encouraged” by the company’s recent announcement of a decision to 
close 200 low-quality Gap brand and <span class="companylink">Banana Republic</span> locations with the aim to focus on its Old Navy and Athleta chains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We believe the move to a
 healthier fleet and an increased focus on digital is prudent as sales 
continue to shift online,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Buss raised his 
fiscal 2017 comparable same-store sales growth, revenue and earnings per
 share projections to 1.1 per cent, $15.517-billion (U.S.) and $2.06, 
respectively, from 0.9 per cent, $15.512-billion and $2.02. His 2018 
estimates moved to 1.6 per cent $15.912-billion and $2.27 from 0.8 per 
cent, $15.765-billion, and $2.15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His target price for the stock increased to $30 from $23. The analyst average is $26.47.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Believing its merger with <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T Inc</span>. (T-N) is close to receiving regulatory approval, Credit Suisse analyst Omar Sheikh downgraded <span class="companylink">Time Warner Inc</span>. (TWX-N) to “neutral” from “outperform.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In the U.S., we believe 
it would be difficult for the DOJ to block the transaction on antitrust 
grounds given its vertical nature and the precedent from <span class="companylink">Comcast</span>'s
 acquisition of NBCU,” he said. “The main outstanding antitrust barrier 
is in Brazil, where the regulator (CADE) has highlighted competition 
concerns about the merger – however, we note that in the worst case T 
could divest <span class="companylink">Sky</span> Brasil to alleviate these concerns.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sheikh raised his 2017 and 2018 earnings per share projections to $6.09 and $6.63 from $5.95 and $6.62.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said: “We have confidence in <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span>'s
 future earnings growth given (1) as a pure-play content owner, it is 
structurally well-positioned as consumption of video content migrates 
online and new opportunities to monetize content emerge; (2) the 
roll-out of <span class="companylink">HBO</span> NOW should tap new demand for the product and could substantially boost 2020 <span class="companylink">HBO</span>
 EBITDA; (3) Turner screens well on our proprietary genre analysis, and 
we remain bullish on the company's ability to grow affiliate fees over 
the long term.”He maintained a price target of $107.50 (U.S.). Consensus
 is $105.85.“<span class="companylink">Time Warner</span>'s guidance of 
‘high single-digit’ growth in adjusted operating income in 2017 suggests
 the company is still benefiting from strong organic operating trends, 
notably in its core Turner cable networks division where the most recent
 affiliate renewal cycle continues to drive strong revenue growth 
despite softening subscriber trends,” the analyst said. “Absent a merger
 proposal, we argue TWX would likely trade in the 9.3-9.6 times 2018 
enterprise value/EBITDA range today, based on 8.5-9 times for Turner, 11
 times for <span class="companylink">HBO</span> and 9.5 times for <span class="companylink">Warner Bros</span>., suggesting fair value if <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span>
 were to walk away or the deal is blocked of $83-87. If the deal were to
 break, we believe the stock would likely trade above fair value given 
the quality and scarcity value of TWX's assets and their attractiveness 
to other potential merger partners.”</p>

 Angus is a good fit for Toronto's Pilot Tavern. The bar and the NDP 
leadership hopeful both have rich musical histories, so before he sits 
down for a bite, he has to bound over to say hi to the bartender, 
himself a member of a well-known band. Of course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Angus, an old rocker, is 
in the final days of his longest tour of all. It's the waning days of 
the party's leadership race, one that has been fought well below the 
national radar, but one that has major ramifications for Canadian 
politics.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For
 Angus to win, he must motivate the party's longtime members, many of 
whom he admits had let their memberships lapse, had drifted and were 
still bruised by a spirit-breaking 2015 campaign defeat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is believed to have most of that support, but they have to be enthusiastic enough to vote when balloting begins Sept. 18.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He must beat back an 
insurgent campaign from Ontario MPP Jagmeet Singh, the late campaign 
momentum of Quebec MP Guy Caron, who Tuesday picked up the endorsement 
of former party president Brian Topp, and the hard-left movement being 
built by Manitoba MP Niki Ashton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Angus is working to 
return the NDP to the days of Jack Layton, when members had a stake in 
decisions and felt valued, before the days when they were impersonally 
hit up for cash and told what the party's message was.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The party under Tom 
Mulcair had become rigid, hidebound, overly bureaucratic and afraid to 
take risks or make mistakes. It was the antithesis of bold. The Orange 
wave became the beige puddle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's been a tough road for Angus. He's had to campaign with the weight of his sister's death this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's had to endure 
sniping that he is too old, that politics, particularly leadership 
politics, are for the younger. Angus is 54, nine years older than Justin
 Trudeau, 16 years older than Conservative leader Andrew Scheer and 
Singh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Andrew Scheer acts a lot older than me,'' he laughs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I am a generation younger than (Bernie) Sanders or (Jeremy) Corbyn.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His ability to bring the 
party back in Quebec is rightly questioned, although he would likely 
make Caron a deputy leader and Quebec lieutenant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Singh says he has signed 
up 47,000 of the almost 124,000 eligible voters, including 30,000 across
 Ontario. Angus believes those numbers are bogus, part of a Singh bluff 
and bluster effort to win on the first ballot. But Singh has not backed 
down from his tally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Angus won't reveal his own membership numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Singh supporters 
will be seen as instant New Democrats and their commitment to the party 
beyond their candidate will be questioned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this is the bottom 
line in this leadership race. If Singh gets his people out to vote, 
Angus's efforts to build bridges to second or third ballot support may 
not matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As leader he would target the Liberal government for walking away from promises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He lists a "cynical" walk
 away from electoral reform. Not so much the policy, but more a prime 
minister blatantly breaking his word.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Indigenous 
reconciliation, he says Trudeau has been all talk and symbols. Angus is 
rightly appalled at the sight of Liberal ministers going to court to 
fight a <span class="companylink">Canadian Human Rights Tribunal</span> decision aimed at helping Indigenous children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He sees an Indigenous 
justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, fighting residential school 
survivors in court. He sees a brutally inefficient Indigenous Affairs 
bureaucracy that can't deliver services while children die and continues
 to try to erase Indigenous identity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He would create an 
independent child's ombudsman who could act so kids aren't dying because
 somebody's request for help is sitting on a desk somewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He believes the Liberal 
government has also failed on the environment after its grand promises 
at the Paris environmental summit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He would legislate the limits on greenhouse <b>gas</b>
 emissions, but remains somewhat vague on the West Coast Kinder Morgan 
pipeline which has pitted the Alberta NDP government of Rachel Notley 
against the British Columbia NDP government of John Horgan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says he is concerned about the safety of the pipeline expansion and he does not believe it has garnered the "<b>social license</b>" needed for the project but he wants to move beyond pipeline debates and talk about a new energy industry in this country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Angus has the chops for 
the job and could reinvigorate the party from the bottom up. But only if
 the party looks away from the flash of the Singh insurgency.</p>

<span class="companylink">Desjardins Group</span> promises a decision this month on whether to turn a brief moratorium on loans to pipeline projects into a permanent boycott.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a precedent-setting 
move from North America's largest credit union, which announced the 
moratorium in July, yet to date, the oil patch and Bay Street have been 
largely indifferent to Desjardin's debate over the pros and cons of 
pipes.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary-based
 energy-industry groups initially took shots at Desjardins's decision to
 bow to pressure from environmentalists, but quickly let the issue go 
quiet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In finance circles, 
executives at rival banks were either dismissive – one sarcastically 
asked “When did Desjardins start lending to pipelines?" – or sadly 
realistic, pointing out that the alternative to pipelines is shipping 
crude oil by rail through la belle province, and we learned how badly 
that can go wrong in Lac-Mégantic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The business community 
ignores the emotionally charged pipeline debate within Desjardins at its
 peril. A decision at the credit union, which speaks for seven million 
members and clients, doesn't dry up cash for energy megaprojects, but it
 would have enormous symbolic value in Quebec, and would likely serve as
 a call to action across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many clients, there's
 a deep relationship to a credit union that's not often found in 
customer ties to a bank or other financial institution. This is 
especially true for many patrons of Desjardins, which has a 117year 
history and branches in a great many villages and towns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the credit union's 
social role is not always well appreciated from outside the province, 
Desjardins speaks for a significant slice of the Quebec population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Desjardins is wrestling 
with a decision on energy transportation that's baffling to most folks 
in financial and engineering circles: This crowd just doesn't get 
opposition to pipelines. Most members of the business community see 
utilities as well-regulated companies filled with clever, if slightly 
boring engineers who move oil and <b>gas</b> with admirable reliability (contrast relatively rare pipeline leaks to how often the cellphone network drops calls).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there's a significant
 portion of the population that draws a straight line from global 
warming and starving polar bears to energy megaprojects. These clients 
have already pushed European banks such as <span class="companylink">ING Group</span>
 into halting loans to pipelines. Environmental and First Nations groups
 are becoming increasingly strident in protest at North American 
financial institutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Utilities build and operate pipelines with a <b>social license</b>,
 an ephemeral but important concept that implies people have to be 
comfortable with the way a company does business if that company is 
going to keep doing business. If Desjardins, its seven million clients 
and 47,000 employees decide the institution is no longer lending to 
pipelines, there's a strong argument that the projects have lost their 
social licence in Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a minimum, a permanent
 Desjardins ban on pipeline lending would be a huge setback for the 
planned $16-billion Energy East pipeline, which passes virtually every 
major population centre in Quebec as it carries crude from Alberta and 
Saskatchewan to three refineries and a marine terminal on the east 
coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s Energy East project 
already faces wellorganized opposition from the likes of 80 mayors in 
the Montreal area and a host of environmental groups. The federal 
Liberals have remained supportive. Approval becomes even more unlikely 
if one of province's largest financial institutions comes out against 
financing pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Desjardins' pipeline 
policy will also guide the thinking at credit unions in jurisdictions 
such as British Columbia, where a newly installed NDP government is 
already catering to its political base by moving to reverse the previous
 regime's decisions on energy projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are better ways for
 a financial institution to help shape Canada's energy future than the 
radical approach under consideration at Desjardins, which would cut off 
funding to a capital-intensive sector that is critical to the country's 
economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long before Desjardins 
announced its moratorium, wellinformed voices in banking were mapping 
out a path to a green future. In a keynote speech last year in Edmonton,
 Royal Bank of Canada CEO Dave McKay put forward a thoughtful case for 
using the wealth generated from fossil fuels to help fund the 
renewableenergy project that can power the economy going forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our ability in the 
decades ahead to finance innovation, to create the technologies that 
will power the 21st century and help transform the world to a cleaner 
economy, depends on our decisions today to get our natural resources to 
market," Mr. McKay said. RBC's CEO noted Canada hasn't built a major 
pipeline since 2010, while the Americans have increased capacity by 17 
per cent in the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actively engaging with 
energy companies and advocating for a future that's less reliant on 
fossil fuels better fits with Desjardins' progressive mandate than 
simply cutting ties with <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> and the rest of utilities, which are among Canada's biggest corporations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A precedent-setting 
boycott would be a bad decision. The move would be largely symbolic – 
the Quebec credit union will never be a major lender to pipelines – yet 
it would signal that a major financial institution is no longer willing 
to do business with the oil patch, a key sector of the economy. If 
executives at Canada's largest financial institutions stop talking to 
leaders in the energy sector, this country is heading in the wrong 
direction.</p>

<span class="companylink">Cenovus Energy Inc</span>. (CVE-T, CVE-N) finds itself in a “particularly precarious position,” according to <span class="companylink">Desjardins Securities</span> analyst Justin Bouchard.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr.
 Bouchard said a “depleted margin of safety” has increased the risk 
surrounding the Calgary-based integrated oil company, amplified by $43 
(U.S.) per barrel WTI.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the analyst 
believes Tuesday’s investor day in Toronto did provide “incremental 
clarity” on its strategy moving forward, including the announcement that
 Brian Ferguson is poised to retire as chief executive officer and 
director at the end of October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“CVE refreshed its 
strategy, including an updated disposition target of $4–5-billion (which
 has been expanded to include Palliser and Weyburn) by year-end, the 
deferral of additional oil sands projects until it has sufficiently 
delevered, additions to its oil sands growth portfolio through land 
acquisitions and technology improvements,” said Mr. Bouchard. “It also 
noted the potential for medium-term infrastructure constraints as it 
works to execute its Deep Basin growth plan.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Mr. Bouchard referred to numerous headwinds faced by Cenovus, which he said put it “between a rock and a hard place.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The confluence of elevated net debt levels, low oil and <b>gas</b>
 prices, limited financial liquidity ($5.3-billion of debt maturing by 
year-end 2019), substantial increase in shares outstanding and impending
 divestment of CVE shares by <span class="companylink">ConocoPhillips</span>
 (adding technical pressure on the stock price), loss of market 
confidence in the story and attempt to execute a substantial divestment 
strategy in a buyer’s market (which increases the risk of fetching an 
underwhelming price for the assets) all contribute to the negative 
sentiment,” he said. “In our view, the only way out of this tailspin 
begins with the successful execution of its divestment strategy, 
followed closely by a rebound in commodity prices (to $55 U.S. per 
barrel plus WTI), which would in turn solve the company’s liquidity 
concerns. However, even then, we believe market confidence would only 
return following an extended period of successful execution of its Deep 
Basin strategy—which probably will not occur until after 2018 (at the 
earliest). Meanwhile, looking at the downside risks in the section that 
follows, we believe Cenovus is out of ‘easy levers’ to pull in the event
 that oil prices remain low for longer.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accordingly, Mr. Bouchard
 dropped his target price for Cenovus shares to $14 from $20 with an 
unchanged “buy” rating. The analyst consensus price target is $16.94, 
according to Bloomberg data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“From our perspective, 
the core of Cenovus — the FCCL and Narrows Lake assets — remains highly 
attractive owing to its best-in-class oil sands acreage, long-life and 
low-decline production base, and opportunities for further expansion at 
attractive capital efficiencies,” he said. “From a fundamental 
perspective, the stock is trading well below its intrinsic value (in our
 view), but that’s not the market focus right now. Instead, the market’s
 attention is set squarely on the fact that the company has depleted its
 margin of safety and muddied the waters through its purchase of the <span class="companylink">Conoco</span>
 Deep Basin assets. That, in turn, has greatly increased the number of 
headwinds and has dramatically amplified the risks surrounding the story
 — including elevated debt levels, reduced liquidity, its execution of a
 divestment strategy in a buyer’s market, questions surrounding its 
ability to deliver on the Deep Basin assets, the significant increase in
 shares outstanding and the loss of market confidence — each of which is
 magnified given the current commodity environment ($45 U.S. per barrel 
WTI) and simply cannot be ignored. As a result, while we are maintaining
 our Buy rating, we are cutting our target price.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, while acknowledging risks remain for investors due to the recent share price decline, <span class="companylink">Peters &amp; Co</span>. analyst Tyler Reardon said the current valuation is “attractive enough now to warrant buying the stock.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He upgraded Cenovus to “sector outperform” from “sector perform.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With the recent weak 
performance in Cenovus' stock price, it is becoming more evident that 
many of the challenges the company faces are reflected in the share 
price," the firm said. "We believe that the asset sales as outlined by 
the company will be completed with the anticipated proceeds sufficient 
to cover the bridge loan ($3.5-billion). Even with these dispositions, 
debt levels remain high as netbacks are very low at oil prices. The 
question of whether to buy the stock at this level really comes down to 
three things: (1) does it have sufficient longevity to allow an investor
 time for a commodity price recovery; (2) are the assets of high enough 
quality to matter in a $45 U.S. per barrel to $55/B pricing environment;
 and (3) is the potential upside in the share price attractive enough at
 this point to compensate for the downside risk. With asset sales to be 
completed in the coming months, this should allow the company time to 
withstand lower oil prices. Although the various metrics look challenged
 at strip prices and the equity is very sensitive to lower commodity 
prices, we believe that its assets are generally high quality and will 
compete with most other North American developments in this pricing 
range."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Reardon lowered his target to $13 from $14.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canaccord Genuity analyst Dennis Fong upgraded the company to "buy" from "hold" with a $15 target (unchanged).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the flip side, 
Macquarie analyst Brian Bagnell downgraded Cenovus to "underperform" 
from "neutral" with a $8 target (from $15).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TD Securities analyst Menno Hulshof said Cenovus’ road is “now defined, but appears long and winding.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He lowered his target to $15.50 from $18.50 with a “buy” rating (unchanged).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Although the role of the
 Deep Basin in its five-year strategic plan was well-articulated, its 
extended balance sheet remains front-and-center,” the analyst said. “To 
this end, CVE has increased its year-end divestiture target to 
$4-billion-$5-billion from $3.6-billion. Assets added to the list (i.e.,
 in addition to Pelican Lake and Suffield) include Weyburn and Palliser 
Block. It also flagged the potential for the sale of Deep Basin GORRs, 
oil sands GORRs, undeveloped oil sands leases, and infrastructure. 
However, with WTI oil prices continuing to slide (now $44 U.S. per 
barrel), it is unlikely that the market will give CVE the benefit of the
 doubt until it can get some of these transactions across the line. 
Selling Pelican Lake and Suffield in Q3 (per guidance) at reasonable 
metrics would be a step in the right direction, in our view.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CIBC World Markets analyst Arthur Grayger dropped his target to $13 from $18 with a "neutral" rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Cenovus' 2017 Investor 
Day covered a range of topics: including an update on expected 
disposition proceeds, capital allocation expectations once the balance 
sheet is in better shape, various sustainable improvements to the cost 
structure of the oil sands business and growth plans, commentary on the 
latest technological innovations, and a deep dive on the Deep Basin 
assets," he said. "Unfortunately, the market remains acutely focused on 
the near-term priorities for the company such as debt repayment and now 
management uncertainty, which overshadowed the key takeaways from the 
Investor Day presentation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial Alliance Securities analyst Dylan Steuart upgraded his rating for <span class="companylink">Home Capital Group Inc</span>.
 (HCG-T) in reaction to its agreement to sell a portfolio of commercial 
mortgage assets valued at approximately $1.2-billion to <span class="companylink">KingSett Capital</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The agreement is 
positive for two reasons,” he said. “First, the $1.16-billion of 
expected proceeds will enable HCG to pay down a significant portion of 
the $1.65-billion of outstanding balance on the 10-per-cent[<span class="companylink">Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan</span>]
 credit line. Second, the proceeds are estimated at 97 per cent of the 
total principal value ($1.2-billion). The estimated impact on earnings 
of $15-million from the divestiture is fairly modest given the very 
recent distressed situation at the firm.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Steuart said the 
troubled company’s liquidity situation is “stabilizing,” adding: “While 
earnings power remains negatively impacted by recent events, the funding
 situation has improved. Current liquidity of $1.14-billion has 
stabilized over the past month, with indications that asset run-off has 
been in line with the deposit outflow.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The biggest outstanding 
question is, what is the earnings power of the operations on an ongoing 
basis? At this stage, there are likely too many unknowns to get a solid 
handle on that question, but two things we know for sure: 1) the asset 
base is shrinking, and 2) margins are likely narrowing. Net interest 
margin as of Q1/17 was 2.44 per cent, up 6 basis points year over year, 
but marked a period of time not impacted by recent turmoil. This asset 
sale of high yield commercial mortgages (yielding 5.76 per cent as of 
Q1/17) will put downward pressure on margins. We estimate a 10 basis 
points negative impact to asset yields from this transaction in a 
vacuum. Recent increases in GIC rates (Oaken rates are up ~75 bps since 
the crisis began) are expected to be somewhat offset by increases in 
non-prime mortgage rates, but we still expect some compression in net 
interest margins. Combine narrowing margins with a shrinking loan book, 
and it is clear that the earnings power of the franchise has been 
negatively impacted over the medium term. We calculated core EPS of 
$1.03 in Q1/17 ($4.11 on an annualized basis). Stressing run-rate 
earnings assuming a shrinking balance sheet and narrowing margin 
indicate that the earnings impact of recent events is meaningful.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Steuart said HCG’s 
outlook has “brightened considerably” since his the latest update to his
 financial model for the company following the release of its 
first-quarter results on May 11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We assume a much slower 
reduction of the uninsured loan portfolio and more favourable terms on 
the line of credit starting in Q3/17,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He raised his full-year 
operating earnings per share projection to 75 cents from 42 cents, while
 his 2018 expectation is now 67 cents, rising from a 95-cent loss. He 
now projects HCG will have a tangible book value per share at $24.08 at 
the end of 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bumping his rating to 
“speculative buy” from “hold,” Mr. Steuart increased his target price 
for HCG shares to $19 from $10.50. Consensus is 14.07.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Raymond James analyst Brenna Phelan also hiked her target price for its shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Recently, <span class="companylink">Home Capital</span>
 has faced a number of negative events, culminating in a crisis of 
confidence whereby it lost $2.5-billion of deposit funding and saw its 
share price decline to close at a low of $5.85 per share,” she said. “We
 view recent developments, specifically settlement with the OSC for 
$30-million, mostly stabilizing (although still costly) deposit funding,
 a reconstituted Board of Directors, and a stated intent to focus on its
 core business as increasingly both encouraging and reflective of a more
 certain operating future for its non-prime mortgage lending business. 
Our estimates, which had previously assumed non-core asset dispositions 
at a discount of 5 per cent in 2Q, are revised to reflect the more 
favorable terms of this $1.2-billion portfolio sale. Overall, the price 
(see below) and the liquidity this sale provides, coupled with more 
stable funding, still-strong demand for non-prime loans and the removal 
of overhang from the OSC suits serve to brighten our outlook 
meaningfully.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the transaction, Ms.
 Phelan’s adjusted earnings per share projection for fiscal 2017 jumped 
to 43 cents from a loss of $1.18. Her 2018 estimate is now $2, up from 
43 cents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With an unchanged “market perform” rating, her target jumped to $17.50 from $10.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While we continue to 
believe a discount to book value is appropriate as current funding costs
 remain too costly to allow for profitable portfolio growth, we are 
increasing our multiple to reflect solid recent progress and much 
greater visibility,” she said. “We note that $17.50 equates to 9.0 times
 our 2018 EPS estimate, to which there may be upside if funding costs 
improve.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial Alliance Securities analyst Elias Foscolos called <span class="companylink">Enerflex Ltd</span>.'s (EFX-T) $140-million deal for Mesa Compression LLC a "beachhead" acquisition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the deal, announced
 Monday night, the analyst expects EFX’s total compression fleet to 
almost 600,000 horsepower, while expanding its geographic footprint 
south of the border. He projects the deal to be immediately accretive to
 earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We believe that EFX has 
been looking to grow both its compression rental and After Market 
Service ) business in the U.S. for many years,” said Mr. Foscolos. “The 
U.S. is the world’s largest <b>gas</b> producer, and to us it makes sense that EFX has made this acquisition to establish a ‘beachhead’ position in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“One key challenge that 
EFX has faced in growing its U.S. rental business has been that beyond 
E&amp;P companies owning compression assets, the U.S. market has a 
substantial amount of Master Limited Partnerships that dominate the 
compression rental space. These MLPs are similar to the old Corporate 
Income Trusts in Canada, in that they eliminated a layer of taxation. We
 speculate that EFX’s ability to quickly close the transaction with cash
 and credit facilities will be a strong selling feature for vendors. We 
view the Mesa acquisition as a ‘mini-AXIP’ transaction. In mid-2014, EFX
 made a transformative acquisition by acquiring the international 
compression assets of AXIP International for $430-million U.S., which 
included 285,000 <span class="companylink">HP</span> of compression (448 units) in addition to some <b>gas</b>
 processing facilities. Over time, the Company was able to organically 
grow its compression fleet using the AXIP acquisition as a toe-hold and 
improve its <span class="companylink">AMS</span> revenue. As in the AXIP acquisition, we believe value will ultimately come from cross-selling opportunities.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keeping his “strong buy” rating for the stock, Mr. Foscolos bumped his target to $23.50 from $23. Consensus is $24.39.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While we believe the 
acquisition will be accretive to EBITDA over time, the impact at this 
point is not material enough in nature to move the needle on a multiple 
basis as we are basing our multiple based target valuation on the 
12-month period ending June 30, 2018, and we believe cross-selling 
opportunities in the short term may be limited,” he said. “We do see a 
longer-term benefit and as a result our DCF [discounted cash flow 
valuation has increased to $20.25 (previously $19.75).”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raymond James analyst 
Andrew Bradford bumped his target for Enerflex shares to $22 from 
$21.50.Mr. Bradford said: “We believe that Enerflex’s acquisition of 
Mesa Compression LLC represents attractive value for investors, 
especially given the stability of its cash flow. Mesa’s market focus is 
different than EFX’s traditional mid-stream orientation, which makes it 
difficult for us to comment on the acquisition’s strategic value with 
any confidence. That said, our expectation is that EFX will have little 
trouble growing Mesa’s core business, and perhaps will broaden the 
service offering to larger-scale mid-stream contract compression 
services as well. We continue to rate Enerflex Outperform."CIBC World 
Markets' Jon Morrison raised his target by 50 cents to $25 with an 
"outperformer" rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Morrison said: "We 
view the Mesa acquisition as a solid transaction that is on point with 
Enerflex's long-term corporate strategy and is being completed at what 
we consider as an attractive and logical purchase price. In addition, 
the assets are adjacent to three of the most active unconventional plays
 in the Lower 48, which positions the company to be able to: 1) realize a
 long tail of operating and financial contribution from the acquired 
fleet, which matches the long-life nature of the assets; and, 2) further
 expand Enerflex's presence in the U.S. contract compression business, 
which has been a long-term goal for the company."</p>

move.”Ms. McShane also believes <span class="companylink">Target</span>’s
 “big” catalysts have already been realized, adding: “CEO Brian Cornell 
(who started Aug 2014) has already improved the profile of the business 
significantly over the past couple years through: 1) Closing the 
underperforming Canadian TGT segment (Jan. 2015), 2) Selling the 
underperforming pharmacy business to CVS (June 2015), 3) Cutting costs 
by $2.0-billion, and 4) Improving capital allocation with greater-than 
$7.0-billion in share buybacks and the annual dividend per share payout 
grew greater-than 24 per cent.”The analyst lowered her target price for <span class="companylink">Target</span>
 shares to $56 (U.S.) from $63 “on flattish growth ahead combined with 
higher assumptions for capex.” Consensus is currently $59.59.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Though TGT’s 3-year 
multiple average is slightly above 14 times, we think the implied 
14-times multiple is still fairly pricey given the declining comp trends
 driven in part by decelerating Signature comps,” she said. “Plus, TGT’s
 prospects of reaccelerating comps are more uncertain compared with 
prior years as their closest competitors are aggressively increasing 
omnichannel capabilities through acquisitions (AMZN/WFM, 
WMT/Jet.com).“TGT has a challenging road ahead with likely need for 
greater investment spend which could put more down pressure on the 
stock. We could see potential upside if TGT benefits in the short term 
from dept. store (and others) door closures and better inventory 
management, but we think upside is limited given long term secular 
concerns.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis believes <span class="companylink">Adobe Systems Inc</span>. (ADBE-Q) is “doing just what exceptional companies do – execute consistently and well.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the San 
Jose-based software company second-quarter 2017 financial results that 
Mr. Davis deemed “solid across the board.” It reported total revenue for
 the period of $1.772-billion (U.S.), ahead of the analyst’s expectation
 by $42-million and a 27-per-cent increase year over year. It achieved 
operating margins, earnings per share and operating cash flow of 37.2 
per cent, $1.02, and $645-million, ahead of the analyst’s estimates by 
190 basis points, 8 cents, and $280-million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We believe <span class="companylink">Adobe</span>,
 through skillful acquisitions and on point development, has perhaps the
 widest competitive moat of any software firm we know,” said Mr. Davis. 
“We are not saying <span class="companylink">Adobe</span> has no 
competition, but the competitive set is simply not as intensely or 
directly overlapping as what other software firms face. When you combine
 a very compelling business with an investor expectations setting 
machine that literally is second to none, you get exactly what we have 
seen from ADBE shares: pretty consistent, better-than-market 
appreciation. Therefore, guess what, <span class="companylink">Adobe</span>
 did it again with another strong quarter, even adjusting for a bit of 
sandbagging guidance we got off of the last print; even so, the 
algorithms will rejoice and the longs might react favorably, both of 
which should propel ADBE shares higher. We call <span class="companylink">Adobe</span>
 one of our secular BUY ‘compounding’ stocks, which means that investors
 should rationally expect ADBE shares to roughly double within a 
five-year window.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the results, <span class="companylink">Adobe</span>
 also released third-quarter revenue guidance of $1.815-billion, beating
 Mr. Davis’s expectation by $22.5-million. Non-GAAP EPS is projected to 
be $1, which is four cents ahead of the analyst’s projection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In reaction to the results and guidance, Mr. Davis increased his target for <span class="companylink">Adobe</span> shares to $165 (U.S.) from $145. Consensus is $146.54.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He maintained a “buy” rating for the stock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, RBC Dominion 
Securities analyst Ross MacMillan also raised his financial projections 
for the company, but he did not touch his $157 target or “outperform” 
rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“ADBE continues to 
deliver on the promise of better operating leverage and a longer tail to
 the model transition, but still has pricing and capital allocation 
muscles to flex,” said Mr. MacMillan. “We continue to see a strong 
earnings/ cash flow compounding story.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Exchange Income Corp</span>. (EIF-T) is 
“designed to deliver safe dividend growth,” said Cormark Securities 
analyst David Tyerman.He initiated coverage of the Winnipeg-based 
company, which is focused on opportunities in aerospace and aviation 
services and equipment, and manufacturing, with a “buy” rating.“EIC has 
increased its dividend 12 times since its first dividend in June 2004, 
raising the dividend at a 5.8-per-cent annual rate (106 per cent total) 
to the current 17.5 cents per month rate (7.2-per-cent annual yield) and
 without a single decrease,” said Mr. Tyerman. “EIC has achieved this by
 building a diversified business portfolio focused on aviation, 
aerospace and manufacturing assets. Growth is driven through acquisition
 and organic sources. The Company focuses on businesses with low 
volatility and low cross-correlation. EIC also seeks to protect and grow
 the dividend by maintaining prudent financial leverage and payout 
ratios.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tyerman believes 
additional growth is “baked in,” expecting to see returns on recent 
“large organic invested capital deployment.”The analyst set a price 
target of $40 for the stock. Consensus is $44.70.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We recommend investors 
buyEIC shares to benefit from EIC’s attractive dividend yield and EPS 
and dividend growth potential,” he said. “EIC’s $2.10 annualized 
dividend (paid monthly) yields 7.2 per cent at the Company’s current 
share price. We estimate EIC will increase its dividend by an average of
 6.4 per cent per year and its EPS by 7.1 per cent per year from 2016 to
 2019. We also think the stock is undervalued. We believe the 
combination of good EPS growth, a moderate valuation multiple bump and 
solid and growing dividends should generate an attractive 44.6-per-cent 
investment return over the next year. We expect continued good 
investment upside beyond the next year from the same factors.”=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other analyst actions:- <span class="companylink">BMO</span> Nesbitt Burns analyst Gerrick Johnson initiated coverage of <span class="companylink">Camping World Holdings Inc</span>. (CWH-N) with an "outperform" rating and $36 (U.S.) target. Consensus is $36.14.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"CWH is the largest 
retailer of recreational vehicles (RV) in the United States," he said. 
"We believe CWH stands to grow earnings and EBITDA at a better rate than
 the market currently anticipates owing to strong growth in the RV 
industry, opportunities to take share through scale and differentiated 
product offerings,and a roll-up strategy of acquiring independent 
dealers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- <span class="companylink">BMO</span> Nesbitt Burns analyst R. Scott Graham initiated coverage of <span class="companylink">Xylem Inc</span>. (XYL-N) with an "outperform" rating and $60 (U.S.) target. Consensus is $56.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We believe XYL is about 
to improve its long-term earnings growth, which has averaged only 1 per 
cent per year since its 2011 spin from <span class="companylink">ITT</span>
 [Corp.]," said Mr. Graham. "Legacy sales should increasingly benefit 
from better verticals, secular trends, its 35-40-per-cent 
replacement/recurring business, emerging market growth and new 
go-to-market plans. We expect cost-down programs to drive margin 
expansion. Newly acquired Sensus has similar growth dynamics, and should
 be accretive to sales and earnings growth. We see mid-teens earnings 
growth in ‘17-18 with potential upside. We expect XYL to outperform from
 this growth and modest relative multiple expansion."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DON MARTIN: Welcome back.
 The Tuesday trio of MPs are around the table again to talk pipe dreams 
and nightmares, and the need to crack down on foreign influences over 
elections. Marco Mendicino is a Liberal MP from Toronto, when he's not 
the spy at the Conservative convention...</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARCO MENDICINO (Liberal - Ontario): Oh, no.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: ...on the 
weekend. Michelle Rempel's a Conservative MP from Calgary. And here with
 a happy face in solidarity with his BC NDP colleagues is NDP MP Murray 
Rankin. Welcome to you all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MENDICINO: All right, Michelle, I've got to go to you. These guys came out and said we'll use every tool in the toolbox to stop <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>. Your party went after the prime minister today. Realistically what do you want the government in Ottawa to do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MICHELLE REMPEL 
(Conservative - Alberta): Well, Justin Trudeau has a problem. So his BC 
caucus does not want this pipeline to go forward because they know their
 electoral prospects are dim, should they do that. I mean, that's not a,
 that's a very public issue. So he's got a caucus saying I don't want to
 do this, but then he's got an economy that depends on the sustainable 
development of our energy sector. So this is what I predict Justin 
Trudeau will do, because he looked very nervous talking about this, this
 afternoon. He's going to continue silently killing the energy sectors 
through things like the tanker ban, the carbon tax, which was supposed 
to buy <b>social license</b> for pipelines. That was a hashtag sale, I 
think. You know, continuing to not address the skilled labour issue 
moving out of my province, and then sort of go like this (wiping hands),
 okay, provinces, you guys fight it out amongst themselves. That's, 
that's the political play here. So, you know, Marco's going to come out 
and say the prime minister said this and that. But what I expect, and 
you know, if we talk about this in six months, the prime minister like, 
like the marijuana issue, all of that stuff, this prime minister, Justin
 Trudeau divests things to the province, and that's what's going to 
happen here. And you know who's going to be, everybody that's forgotten 
in this, are the workers in the energy sector. And, you know, for the 
people who've been out of work in my, my province that propped up the 
Canadian economy for years, that's really who gets hurt here, and it's a
 matter of politics. And that's really, seriously disgusting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Murray, this is a federal issue. This isn't a provincial issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MURRAY RANKIN (NDP - British Columbia): Well, it's both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Well...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RANKIN: I think it's fair to say it's primarily federal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Construction permits may be at the provincial level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RANKIN: And, and cutting 
permits and wildlife and the like, but you're right, it's primarily an 
interprovincial pipeline so the federal government has final say, I 
think, but this means...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: It's going to be a war, though, right, between Alberta and BC?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RANKIN: I think, you 
know, one of the things that people need to remember is John Horgan, the
 premier in-waiting, it appears, and Premier Notley go back a long way. 
They're friends. They can work things out. That's how people do things 
in Canada. We find compromise. He find common ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Doesn't sound very friendly right now, but anyway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RANKIN: Well, no, 
there's, well, there's, she's looking after the interests of her 
province, and of course, Mr. Horgan is doing the same, but they'll find 
way. They always do. We always, as Canadians, manage to find a way. 
Premier Notley has been very strong on climate change. This was part of 
that positioning with the pipeline, and so forth, and I think that we 
should be optimistic about finding our way through this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: All right, Marco,
 the only criticism we can really say about Trudeau is he hasn't put his
 shoulder behind the wheel of this thing and really pushed it forward 
yet. Is that something he has to do more of?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MENDICINO: I don't know 
how you say that. Given the fact we approved the pipeline, which is 
something Michelle's government couldn't do. The application for the 
pipeline was filled in 2013. They had three years, or two years to do 
it, I beg your pardon...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MENDICINO: ...and 
couldn't get it done. And that's exactly what we did, is we took a look 
at the facts. We took a look at the evidence, which the Conservatives 
failed to do on numerous files, and we approved it. And what does this 
do? It will hopefully create up to 15,000 jobs for Albertans and people 
who live in British Columbia. And it will also balance 157 conditions, 
which will protect the environment. And the outcome of that decision...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: So, I've got a question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MENDICINO: Sorry, I was kind enough to listen to yours. If you could just hear me out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: Okay, great.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MENDICINO: Thank you, 
Michelle, is what this decision, what this principal decision of our 
government will not do, is will not fluctuate based on the outcome of 
the BC election. We will work with the government and we will do so in 
the best interests of all Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTI: You had a question?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: Yeah, so, when we
 were sitting in the Green room, Andrew Weaver said two things. He said 
he made a value judgment on the jobs that people in the energy sector, 
he said Rachel Notley needs to move her province into the 21st century, 
somehow implying that people that work In the energy sector ARE, YOU 
KNOW, the rhetoric that's used on the left - dirty jobs, you know, 
knuckle dragger, that sort of implication. So, what, will you push, 
like, will Justin Trudeau pushed back against that, but more 
importantly, Andrew Weaver said, he talks about section 25, or 35 of the
 Constitution. If that's where the province goes, does Justin, will you 
commit, on air today, that Justin Trudeau will intervene and do 
everything possible and override the wishes of his BC caucus to build 
that pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: 35 means what?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MENDICINO: That section 
35 protects the collective rights of indigenous peoples, and obviously, 
we have engaged and will continue to engage with First Nations and 
Indigenous communities, right across Canada, when it comes to developing
 a sustainable economy, which will create jobs, Don, as well as protect 
the environment, something that the Conservative opposition failed to 
do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: Yeah, that's a no. That's a no. Like, let's be honest here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RANKIN: ...if I may, and 
say that this environmental assessment process that Justin Trudeau came 
to my, my own riding and said would be done differently, was frankly a 
farce, and every environmental lawyer I can talk to, every indigenous 
lawyer would agree. There's, I think, a dozen or more lawsuits that are 
underway, many of them predicated on section 35, the rights of 
Indigenous people. Others on other issues, and I think we're going to 
see a lot of litigation before this thing is...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: And to build, and
 to build on that, where I agree with Murray, is not only is it a farce,
 because they haven't managed to do anything, they've completely 
destabilized the regulatory system, which is a determinant to 
investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RANKIN: Right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: So they've also, 
they've failed to, you know, do anything that Murray talks about, but 
they've also said to the world, don't invest in the energy sector. And 
Marco won't answer my question...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MENDICINO: Well, I think I did. It, it involves...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: ...because this, the Liberals will not take a position on this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MENDICINO: No, I think I did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: And there are 
200,000 people out of work in my province, Marco, and I'm so tired of 
this government completely forgetting them, especially on a day like 
this...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MENDICINO: Well, we, we are, and that's...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: ...where you've got Andrew Weaver saying things like that. You guys have to show leadership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Okay. Marco?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MENDICINO: I understand 
the frustration, Michelle, but until you acknowledge that there are 
decisions made by this government, which are based in fact, and 
evidence, including the approval of this pipeline, then it's hard to 
have a constructive discussion. And the last word I would say on it, 
Don, is my friends to the right don't agree on a lot, and certainly 
climate change is one of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RANKIN: I agree with the climate change initiative, don't tar me with that brush, my friend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: Yes, and, and the
 other thing is, your carbon price, you have not shown any price 
elasticity assumptions that show it's going to materially reduce 
Greenhouse <b>gas</b> emissions, and that's something that Murray and I do agree on, Marco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: I do want to 
quickly get your thoughts, Michelle, though. What kind of frictions are 
setting up across the Rockies? I mean...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: I, you know what,
 when I sat in cabinet, the number one thing that was the first order of
 what we're managing to, is policy that unites the country. And what 
we're seeing here is policy that is creating divisions across every 
region of this country and that is failure on the part of the federal 
government. Justin Trudeau has to stop sending dog whistles into 
different parts of the country speaking in Calgary one day, Houston on 
one day, Vancouver on another, and just say look, this sector is good 
for our economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Murray, quick thought to you on how this affects Alberta-BC relations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RANKIN: I hope we can, as
 I said earlier, take advantage of the fact there's a personal 
friendship between Mr. Horgan and Ms. Notley, and I think that they're 
going to find a way forward. I think the lack of federal leadership is 
clear, and I think I agree with Michelle on that. I think the fact that 
they've sold out the environmental assessment process is something we 
have to come back to. I think First Nations are going to be key in this 
particular file.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: I agree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Very short answer. You've got the NDP and Conservatives getting together on this to say you're the bad guy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MENDICINO: Well, 
(inaudible) you have to peel back the layers, but very, very succinctly,
 what Canadians want is a balance of the competing interests between 
creating an economy that works for them, which we are doing, as well as 
protecting the environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MENDICINO: And this, and this decision reflects both of those principles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Okay. You were very good, Marco. Oh, my goodness, I didn't think that was possible. All right...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MENDICINO: Thanks, Don.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Thank you, all 
three of you. That was a good discussion. All right, coming up, Nova 
Scotia's Liberal government is looking for a second straight majority, 
something that hasn't happened since 1988. When we come back, a preview

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company continues to 
review numerous precious metals projects and companies for potential 
acquisition. Management remains focused, disciplined and selective in 
its due diligence activities as projects must demonstrate the ability to
 be developed into high margin, strong free cash flowing mining 
operations which in turn generate significant value accretion for 
shareholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold Exploration Portfolio, Peru</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As previously announced on April 10, 2017, <span class="companylink">Rio2 Limited</span>, through its whole owned subsidiary Rio2 Exploraciones S.A.C. has entered into a mining assignment and option agreement with <span class="companylink">Compañia Minera Milpo</span>
 S.A.A. pursuant to which it has the right and option to acquire all 
rights and interests in 7 gold exploration prospects totalling 
approximately 19,000 hectares in Peru.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rio2 has recently 
completed site visits to each of the prospects and is in the process of 
planning and prioritizing a first phase exploration program for the 
coming months. Social and community fieldwork has commenced to 
facilitate the gaining of <b>social license</b> for the work programs the Company is planning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company will provide updates to shareholders as it advances its activities on these properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicaragua Strategy</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rio2 has recently applied
 for 10,000 hectares of exploration concessions in Nicaragua as the 
Company ranks the country highly as a destination to do business in the 
mining sector in Latin America. Recognizing the mining sector’s 
potential to boost the country’s gross domestic product and economic 
growth, the Nicaraguan government, through the Ministry of Energy and 
Mines, is actively promoting investments by having established a solid 
legal framework and facilitating the development of mining projects in 
the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bordering Honduras to the
 north, and Costa Rica to the south, Nicaragua’s mining tradition dates 
back to the nineteenth century and has since become one of the country’s
 most dynamic economic sectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rio2 understands that 
less than 10% of the country is currently under exploration and all 
current mining operations are taking place in three historical 
districts: the Golden Triangle (Bonanza, Siuna and Rosita), La 
Libertad/Santo Domingo, and El Limón/La India. The Company intends to 
leverage off of Country Manager, Luc English’s ten years of experience 
of exploring in the country, to acquire precious metals prospects that 
have the potential of being able to be developed into highly profitable 
mining ventures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company will provide updates to shareholders as it advances its activities in Nicaragua.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About Rio2</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The focus of Rio2 is to 
compile an attractive portfolio of precious metals assets that can be 
developed into mines and to assemble a highly experienced technical and 
corporate management team with a solid experience base of developing and
 building mines in South, Central and North America. Through its 
strategy of evaluating and acquiring precious metals projects and 
through a combination of organic exploration and development and 
strategic acquisitions, the management team intends to grow Rio2 and 
create long-term shareholder value through the development of 
high-margin, strong free cash flowing mining operations.</p>

 executives believe that the industry is doing a poor job of 
communicating with the masses on major issues, a potential worry for an 
industry that requires <b>social license</b> to operate, the consulting firm EY found in an annual report on perceptions of the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EY found that 75% of 
executive respondents believe that the industry is doing a "fair" or 
"poor" job communicating with the public, with only 3% believing that 
the industry is doing an "excellent" job. Respondents were even more 
negative when it came to the industry explaining the impact of 
regulations to the public, with 2% saying they do an excellent job and 
78% grading it fair or poor.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 executives were more positive on the idea of communicating about what 
it takes to operate safely, with 54% giving positive marks. 75% said the
 industry was a being a good corporate citizen, and 83% said oil and <b>gas</b> companies were doing an excellent or good job leveraging technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps in part due to 
the perceived inability to get their message out to the public, industry
 executives were more pessimistic on the way the public views them 
compared to how they are viewed in reality. More than three-quarters of 
executives said they believed that the public did not trust them, when 
the actual split was 53%-47% in favor of not trusting, according to the 
public polling phase of the study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy executives also 
said they are doing a poor job attracting young people to work in the 
industry, with only 43% giving an excellent or good rating. EY's look at
 consumer sentiment for the industry indicated that executives may be on
 to something, with 56% of teens ages 16 and 18 saying they do not trust
 the industry and only 42% viewing it positively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, which was 
based on interviews with 109 executives and a survey of 1,204 consumers 
aged 16 and up, was released May 10. The survey group included 200 
respondents aged 16 to 18.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EY U.S. Energy Leader Deborah Byers said oil and <b>gas</b> companies should reconsider how they advertise the industry, as young men and women interested in technology see the oil and <b>gas</b> business as largely blue-collar work and as not using some of the world's most advanced systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is more of a case for action than there has been in the past," she said. "It has become more important to have a <b>social license</b> to operate. It's something we need to concentrate on.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In advance of the webinar
 — click here to register — we sat down with John Lusty, Director of 
Energy &amp; Utilities Solutions at Siemens Industry Software Ltd., to 
learn more about the topics that will be discussed.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1) How can companies drive better business decisions through compliance?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Lusty: While the oil &amp; <b>gas</b>
 industry seems to have turned the corner, most industry participants 
are still straining to reduce overhead while increasing efficiencies. 
The costs associated with compliance and quality management are part 
fixed and part variable, but there’s never been a better time to 
optimize those costs while avoiding the unnecessary impact of 
non-compliance. By taking an enterprise approach and consolidating silos
 of information, the cost-benefit of business decisions that are 
compliance related can be better understood and more consistently 
executed. The application of optimized compliance workflows and 
configurable status reporting can assist in ensuring that decisions made
 resulting from audits, assessments and corrective actions are actioned 
using a customer-defined standard methodology. Over time, a highly 
managed compliance and quality information system becomes a significant 
risk management tool for managers and executives trying to make better 
decisions to increase process efficiencies, while reducing the chance 
that some of those hard-earned gains will be eroded due to quality and 
compliance infractions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2) How can companies better control regulatory documentation and contingency planning?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JL: Taking an enterprise 
approach to compliance management provides energy companies with a 
framework for creating, modifying and versioning, approving, releasing 
and archiving all compliance documentation. Consistency in these 
important areas is achieved by automating customer-defined templates and
 workflows designed to meet internal and external requirements every 
time and on time, while also generating an audit of trail that records 
what happened, when and by whom in case that’s needed later. These same 
capabilities can be used in contingency planning to ensure that 
organizations respond to unexpected events in a way that is consistent 
with their internal and external requirements. Furthermore, given that 
different regulatory reporting regions and business units may have 
different requirements based on the user’s location, the ability to 
include that uniqueness while maintaining continuity is critical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3) How do companies deal with the increasingly onerous requirements for social acceptance?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JL: The oil &amp; <b>gas</b>
 industry in Canada has been under intense scrutiny from many audiences 
with many different interests and agendas and that will not change. The 
best way for companies not to put their <b>social license</b> to operate
 at risk is to not become a target in the first place. By taking a 
structured approach to consistently follow internal and external 
procedures for compliance and quality management is a foundational step.
 With this in place, operational excellence objectives such as operator 
training, asset integrity management, risk and regulatory reporting, 
corrective and preventative actions all become more achievable. With 
society’s requirements for companies to operate as expected, while 
keeping up with the changes that people, markets and governments expect 
of them, it’s not going to get easier. However, by adding a structured 
framework for how we manage those tasks consistently and completely, we 
are putting employees in a better position to make those tasks less 
onerous and fully achievable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4) What about environmental compliance?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JL: Everything we’ve 
discussed so far is equally applicable to the subject of environmental 
compliance as the cost of non-compliance can threaten a company’s 
existence. It’s a reasonable objective that by having properly trained 
employees working safely in a manner that complies with internal and 
external regulations, in a culture that strives for operational 
excellence, that the risk of an event threatening the environment should
 be minimized. That being said, it is nearly impossible to reduce risks 
to zero anywhere. Should an event occur that, it will be critical for 
companies to be able to demonstrate that a high level of due diligence 
to prevent the incident was taken, and to prove that they did everything
 that was required and that could be reasonably expected of them to 
prevent it from happening. This will be useful both as a basis to 
support their actions, but also to update and improve policies and 
procedures to reduce the risk of a similar event happening again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5) What do you hope participants will get from the <span class="companylink">Siemens</span> compliance webinar?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JL: Our intent is to be able to educate participants on how <span class="companylink">Siemens</span>
 solutions and expertise can add structure and predictability to their 
compliance and quality management, while reducing the cost and 
increasing their efficiency to do so. Quality and compliance are 
foundational to every part of the organization and can improve 
profitability if managed effectively. It’s another example of how the 
Siemens Digital Enterprise can be applied to make the Canadian energy 
industry more efficient, innovative and sustainable for the long term.</p>

 simple principles instilled by his parents to leave a place better than
 how you found it echoes in Ian MacGregor's vision of the future for big
 industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The North West Refining CEO and chairman outlined three key changes necessary for success during a presentation on April 5.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Fifty-four
 per cent of Alberta is based on bitumen in some way, and if bitumen 
isn't working, our economy doesn't work anymore," MacGregor said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We can lift the value of
 bitumen by managing CO2, make something of value, and make something we
 can transport with existing infrastructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm all for pipelines, 
I'm all for all railways, I'm all for anything that gets (product) out 
of Alberta, but we don't know if they'll let us do that or not - and if 
they don't let us, I still want have an Alberta as good for my kids as 
it was for me."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likening bitumen to the 
consistency of chilled peanut butter, MacGregor said the low-value 
product is high in carbon dioxide and is sold to a low-price U.S. 
market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Converting bitumen to 
diesel will help the company and the province succeed," MacGregor 
alleged, adding that making that move would be the equivalent of $20 
billion in bitumen sales annually to $70 billion in diesel each year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also pointed to 
potential public opportunities, as the move is one that would see the 
province receive 25 per cent in royalties from each barrel sold, as a 
result of invested feedstock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we charge them the 
cost of what it would be to convert it to diesel, on 37,000 barrels a 
day, they make around $150 million more a year than they would by 
selling it as (bitumen)," MacGregor explained, leaning on what he 
believes to be value in upgrading. "That's what they have to do. They 
have to get that money to fix the problems we got now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added <b>social license</b>
 is already in place to ship diesel worldwide, with more than 1,500 
tankers departing from the B.C. coast each year, which he said would 
eliminate certain problems inherent in seeking pipeline approvals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With <span class="companylink">ExxonMobil</span>
 recently announcing a mark-down of its bitumen reserves, while 
investing $20 billion in new refinery upgrades in the Gulf Coast, 
MacGregor said he is concerned about how long it will take Canada to 
make more value-added products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're saying they have enough land in the U.S. to produce the oil they need...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's really bad news for us," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eyeing the future</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The refinery will be 
integrated with the Alberta Carbon Trunk Line (ACTL), which is 
considered to be the gold standard for CO2 management and environmental 
performance, MacGregor said. It will capture carbon dioxide during the 
refining process, rather than venting the <b>gas</b> into the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This means the fuels 
produced at the Sturgeon Refinery can now have one of the lowest CO2 
footprints," said Alyssa Haunhoter, vicepresident of government and 
stakeholder relations with North West Refining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"(ACTL) will be the 
world's largest system for managing man-made CO2. The system is designed
 to collect CO2 from industrial sources, and transport it to central and
 southern Alberta, where there are depleted oil fields nearing 
abandonment that can be re-invigorated by injecting CO2 before the CO2 
is permanently stored.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Once the CO2 
infrastructure is operational, it will prove to be a significant 
economic advantage in attracting new valueadding industries to Alberta 
that want to mitigate their CO2 footprints and costs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ACTL is similar to <span class="companylink">Shell</span>'s
 Quest Carbon Capture and Storage project; however, it will use the CO2 
to get more oil out of fields in central Alberta before permanently 
storing it. The method is known as "carbon capture utilization and 
storage," and is expected to move 40,000 CO2 tonnes daily, according to 
MacGregor, who said it's like taking every car in Alberta off the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think that's just the
 start of this and it could be a lot bigger than that," he postured. 
"The CO2 part of the system is really where the future is. If we don't 
get that right, then we won't be able to sell the things we make, 
because they won't meet the low-carbon fuel standards and we'll start 
competing with ourselves on price."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phase 1 nearing completion</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, North West Refining's project is 90-percent complete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Turnover of facilities 
from construction to operations is underway, which includes operational 
staff simulator training, 1,260 turnover completion packages, more than 
15,000 loop checks, more than 1,200 motor runs, and more than 3,300 
operating procedures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To put it into 
perspective, we have to do 15,000 loop checks. We have a control panel 
that says, 'this is the value.'We have to check that valve talks to the 
control panel, and the panel moves it in the right way when we push the 
button. There are 15,000 of those things to do," MacGregor explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're going to have 
problems out there when we start it up; they won't be fatal problems 
because it's just what we do. There's no big 'Go'button that we push and
 the whole thing turns on. There are 15,000 things to check."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After three years of 
construction, which began in 2014, more than 22 million field 
construction hours were logged at the end of January 2017, with a peak 
labour force of 7,500 workers on site in 2016. Overall, there were 
76,000 construction jobs. That totalled more than $2.5 billion in 
employment for Albertans for Phase 1, and another 6,700 jobs are slated 
for when the site is fully operational.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The build also added $1.9
 billion in revenue for the provincial government during construction; 
once operational, it is expected to generate $385 million annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discussions now move 
towards Phase 2, which is expected to take place in the coming weeks, 
and the company is positioning itself to make an official ask for 
government backing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think they're engaged 
and really interested, but they're also waiting to see if we can deliver
 on what we said we can do," MacGregor noted.</p>

Charle Gamba, President and CEO of Canacol, commented "The Corporation has achieved significant conventional natural <b>gas</b>
 exploration and development drilling success across its substantial 
acreage position in the Lower Magdalena valley basin over the past 3 
years. Mark Teare, Canacol's Senior Vice President of Exploration will 
comment about our large inventory of conventional natural <b>gas</b> 
opportunities, and the Corporation's recent engagement of GCA to prepare
 an independent audit of the prospective resources of the inventory 
plays, prospects and leads."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Teare said "GCA's independent prospective resources audit evaluated and estimated conventional natural <b>gas</b>
 prospective resources for 47 individual prospects and leads, which 
Canacol has aggregated to an unrisked mean of 2 trillion standard cubic 
feet or a risked mean of 482 billion standard cubic feet. The estimated 
prospective resources underline the significant potential of Canacol's 
exploration blocks located in the Lower Magdalena valley basin of 
northern Colombia. Using state of the art 3D seismic acquisition and 
processing technology, our subsurface G&amp;G technical team has 
developed techniques to high-grade prospects that may be <b>gas</b> 
charged in the Oligocene aged Cienaga de Oro Formation ("CDO") thereby 
reducing the geological risk associated with drilling of the prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, recent exploration drilling success at the Nelson 6 exploration well has opened up a new shallow <b>gas</b>
 play in the Miocene aged Porquero Formation ("Porquero"), which our 
subsurface G&amp;G team is currently investigating further across our 
blocks. With an established prospect and lead inventory that contains 
multiple exploration drilling targets in the CDO, and a new <b>gas</b> 
exploration fairway proven in the shallow Porquero sandstone reservoir, 
we anticipate being very busy exploring our blocks in the foreseeable 
future."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Table Notes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">
(1)   The GCA Report includes estimates of unrisked prospective resources,  
      risked prospective resources and EMVs for individual prospects and    
      leads. The aggregations of these estimates were prepared by Canacol.  
(2)   The Corporation aggregates probabalistically to the country level for 
      internal portfolio management and long term planning. As required by  
      COGEH Volume 2, Sections 2.8.1, an explanation of this aggregation    
      methodology is provided. A single distribution of prospective resource
      volumes on an unrisked and risked basis was generated by means of a   
      multiple trial Monte Carlo simulation incorporating Chance of         
      Discovery (Geological Chance of Success (GCoS)), and Chance of        
      Development (CoD) of all 47 prospects and leads from GCA's audit. From
      the distribution, the Mean is the average value of the distribution,  
      and as such represents the most accurate single point estimation of   
      the expected recoverable volume. The Mean of the distribution is      
      represented on a risked basis relative to the unrisked case to provide
      the reader a more balanced perspective on the likely outcome of an    
      exploration drilling program of all 47 prospects and leads.           
(3)   CoD was quantified by GCA for each prospect and lead by combining the 
      chance of achieving a minimum economic field size (MEFS) with the     
      chance that a discovery would be developed i.e. the chance of         
      achieving commerciality. The overall risked volume for a given        
      prospect or lead is the combination of GCoS and CoD applied to the    
      unrisked volume with the exception that if the EMV for the prospect or
      lead is negative, the CoD was set to zero resulting in zero risked    
      resource.                                                             
(4)   The volumes reported in the table above (Low (P90), Best (P50), Mean, 
      High (P10)) are Gross Prospective Resources volumes at Canacol's Gross
      Working Interest (100%) in the exploration blocks.                    
(5)   All prospects and leads included in this release are conventional     
      natural <b>gas</b>. Conventional natural <b>gas</b> volumes are reported in billions
      of cubic feet at standard conditions of 1 Bar and 20 degrees Celsius.
(6)   Opportunities reported above are potential hydrocarbon accumulations  
      identified on the basis of available data, and depending on the level 
      of information available for their assessment are sub classified as   
      plays, leads and prospects. The assessed GCoS varies, from opportunity
      to opportunity, and GCA has stated that the leads may require         
      additional seismic data prior to becoming viable drillable prospects. 
      One third of the opportunities are classified as leads.               
(7)   The mean aggregate Expected Monetary Value (EMV) in the table above   
      are summations of individual prospect and lead mean EMVs which are    
      calculated as being independent of each other. A schedule for         
      exploration activity was applied to the economic analysis so that a   
      reasonable timing assumption for drilling was represented. This       
      schedule assumes the procurement of four rigs operating over three    
      years to assess the potential of the portfolio.                       
(8)   The EMVs are the product of a decision tree analysis whereby cash     
      flows using a 10% annual discount rate and incorporating the fiscal   
      regime governing the prospects and leads are multiplied by GCoS and   
      CoD, representing the success case, and added to the cash flow of the 
      failure case of a dry hole multiplied by one minus the product of GCoS
      and CoD. For a given prospect or lead, the mean EMV represents the    
      arithmetic average of expected EMVs. In the table, before tax EMV-10  
      is represented as the sum of the mean EMVs for each prospect and lead 
(9)   Economic modeling was based on a pre-development study representing   
      assumptions derived from the Corporation's experience of drilling     
      exploration and development wells, construction of gathering systems  
      and flowlines, and the expansion of processing facilities within the  
      prospective area.                                                     
(10)  The <b>gas</b> price forecast used in the EMV analysis assumed US $5.62/mcf  
      (the volume weighted average price of Canacol's signed contracts at   
      the time of the analysis) escalated at 2%/yr starting in 2017.        
(11)  To realize the modeled US $789 MM EMV10, the total risked capital to  
      achieve commercial production in the mean case is US $742 MM. Over the
      3 year schedule for exploration activity, the total capital associated
      with exploration activity is estimated to be US $194 MM               
(12)  In estimating EMVs, no adjustment has been made for the risk that an  
      economically viable discovery, if made would not be developed in a    
      timely manner.                                                        
(13)  The EMVs reported here do not represent an opinion as to the market   
      value of a property or any interest therein.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The representation of 
prospective resources in the GCA report reflects the resource potential 
of the Corporation's 100% working interest land position (785,000 acres)
 in the Lower Magdalena valley basin. Of primary importance is the 
resource potential of the CDO comprised of up to 5000 feet of deltaic 
and marginal marine sandstones and shales. The CDO play is characterized
 by structural features such as faulted horst blocks and faulted 
three-way dip anticlinal closures. Specific prospects are identified and
 mapped using 3D seismic, and technical risk is further mitigated by the
 application of seismic attribute analysis to investigate the presence 
of <b>gas</b>-charged sandstones. The Corporation has enjoyed 
significant success in both its exploration and development drilling 
program with the CDO play, with 5 out of 6 exploration wells 
encountering <b>gas</b> (83% GCoS), and 4 out of 4 development wells encountering <b>gas</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Corporation is 
committed to investigate new plays in addition to the CDO play to 
mitigate exploration risk. Of particular interest are the turbiditic 
sandstone reservoirs of the shallow Porquero. The new Porquero play is 
typically characterized by faulted, three-way dip anticlinal closures, 
but may also have a stratigraphic component. Porquero exploration 
prospects are identified and mapped using 3D seismic, and technical risk
 is further mitigated by the application of seismic attribute analysis 
to investigate the presence of <b>gas</b>-charged sandstones. Recent 
exploration success at Nelson 6 has successfully demonstrated the 
effectiveness of the seismic attribute analysis and confirmed the 
commerciality of the shallow Porquero play. Work in progress on recently
 reprocessed 3D seismic data has identified additional potential for the
 Porquero play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For both the CDO and the 
Porquero plays, and based upon the representation of prospective 
resources in the GCA Report, management expects that significant 
additional resources will be developed in the future with continued 
drilling success on currently undeveloped blocks. The significant 
factors that may change the prospective resources estimates include the 
outcome of further exploration and delineation drilling, which may 
change the estimates either positively or negatively, future technology 
improvements, which would positively affect the estimates, additional 
processing capacity that could positively affect the volumes recovered 
e.g. additional compression, and the requirement to meet regulatory 
contractual commitments to acquire seismic and drill exploratory wells 
to retain acreage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In accordance to the six 
considerations for Commerciality outlined in COGE Handbook Volume 2 
Section 2.4.4, GCA represents risked prospective resources as a function
 of the Chance of Development (CoD) of any future discovery. Estimating 
CoD requires that the related development project be commercial such 
that the commerciality conditions of regulatory approval for facilities,
 flow lines and access to markets are met. All prospects and leads fall 
within 50 km of the Corporation's central processing facility at Jobo 
that may be easily expanded as required. The Corporation has 
successfully secured sales contracts for its existing production, and is
 confident of its ability to secure future contracts in an expanding 
market both along the Caribbean coast and inland Colombia. To achieve 
its current production levels for natural <b>gas</b> in northern 
Colombia, the Corporation has demonstrated its ability to manage other 
contingencies such as legal, regulatory, political, <b>social license</b>,
 internal and external approvals and access to project finance to ensure
 the timely execution of its exploration and field development plans in 
the future. Appropriate levels of capital investment are anticipated to 
ensure future full field development including drilling, tie-in, 
infrastructure buildout for facilities and flowlines, and abandonment 
and reclamation. The Corporation has prepared a realistic schedule for 
the execution of its proposed exploration drilling campaign over the 
next three years along with additional time scheduled for follow-up 
development drilling, installation of flow-lines, and plant expansion as
 required. Future field development will be for conventional natural <b>gas</b>.
 There is no expectation of HPHT (High Pressure High Temperature) 
reservoirs in the Lower Magdalena valley basin. Any discovery will be 
developed using existing industry technology with standard <b>gas</b> 
completions in the well-bores, and standard surface treatment and 
compression facilities in a same manner as the seven operated fields 
presently under production (Nelson, Palmer, Clarinete, Oboe, Ariana, 
Canaflecha, and Katana).</p>

prospective resources volumes under the heading "risked" have been risk 
discounted for the GCA's estimates of Chance of Discovery (Geological 
Chance of Success (GCoS)) and Chance of Development (CoD) which involves
 assessing various risks based upon a number of assumptions and other 
factors. The Chance of Development is the probability that a resource, 
once it has been discovered, will ultimately be commercially developed. 
While the Corporation believes that such estimates and underlying 
assumptions are reasonable, many of these assumptions are beyond the 
Corporation's control, are subject to change and may not, over time, 
prove to be accurate. As a result, the actual level of various risks 
(including those currently identified and that may be identified in the

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estimates of prospective 
resources are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved 
reserves and would require substantial capital spending over a 
significant number of years to implement recovery. Actual locations 
drilled and quantities that may be ultimately recovered from our

commitment to drill, and likely will not drill, all of the drilling 
locations that have been attributable to these quantities.</p>

 expert panel tasked by the federal government to review the current 
environmental assessment (EA) process with an aim of restoring public 
trust says current assessment processes under the Canadian Environmental
 Assessment Act are incapable of resolving the often disparate points of
 view of stakeholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Views about federal EA 
across the various interests ranged from support to all-out opposition …
 In general, we did not hear strident opposition to the development of 
projects, although in a few cases there were those who held that certain
 projects should not have gone ahead,” the task force said in its report
 released Wednesday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Rather,
 we heard that, when communities, proponents and governments work 
together with mutual respect and understanding in a process that is 
open, inclusive and trusted, assessment processes can deliver better 
projects, bring society more benefits than costs and contribute 
positively to Canada’s sustainable future.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At its heart, the report 
says a “one size fits all” approach to environmental assessments in 
Canada and putting limits on stakeholder engagement is doing a 
disservice to the process. The panel recommends that time limits to 
assess major projects should reflect the specific circumstances of each 
project instead being forced to meet a set time frame.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During its review, the 
panel said it engaged broadly with Canadians, indigenous peoples, 
provinces and territories, and key stakeholders to develop 
recommendations for Catherine McKenna, minister of environment and 
climate change, on how best to improve federal EA processes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As we drew lessons from 
what we had heard across the country, we came to the conclusion that we 
need to improve the way we plan for development in our country. We 
believe that Canadians deserve better and that it is entirely possible 
to deliver better. Our report explains how to achieve this,” the panel 
said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday at the 
International Association for Impact Assessment (IAIA) conference in 
Montreal, McKenna launched a public comment period on the expert panel 
report related to the federal review of environmental assessment 
processes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August 2016, a 
four-person expert panel was established and spent months engaging the 
public, indigenous groups, and stakeholders, both in person and online. 
The panel went to 21 cities, received over 500 online submissions, and 
welcomed over 1,000 participants at engagement sessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We want to build a new 
system that serves the public's interest and provides certainty to 
businesses. At the end of the day, we want to get good projects built. 
We know they create jobs that support communities across our country,” 
McKenna said. “I look forward to reviewing the panel's report and the 
comments from Canadians."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Johanne Gélinas, chair of
 the panel, said the review was “thorough and productive,” and the 
quality of submissions &nbsp;received from a broad range of Canadians, 
including the public, indigenous groups, environmental groups, industry 
and academics was inspiring.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“To all who participated 
in our review, we offer our heartfelt thanks and deep appreciation. 
Without your selfless efforts, we would not have been able to undertake 
this work."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first section of 
the report, Outlining the Vision, the panel laid the foundation for its 
recommendations. And a name change for the EA process could be in the 
works.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We outline that, in our 
view, assessment processes must move beyond the bio-physical environment
 to encompass all impacts likely to result from a project, both positive
 and negative. Therefore, what is now ‘environmental assessment’ should 
become ‘impact assessment’ [IA],” the panel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Changing the name of the
 federal process to impact assessment underscores the shift in thinking 
necessary to enable practitioners and Canadians to understand the 
substantive changes being proposed in our report.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Leach, president of 
the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada (EPAC), said the 
lengthy document “signals a significantly different attitude underlying 
Canada’s approach” to approving major resource projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is a response to 
the sustained attack in recent years on the legitimacy and credibility 
of the institutions which are charged with the responsibility to review,
 approve and regulate natural resource development projects and related 
infrastructure,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If these recommendations
 go forward, the federal government will be occupying a larger 
leadership role in the approval process, no longer content to conduct 
environmental assessments it will be conducting broader based impact 
assessments looking at aboriginal impacts, climate change impacts, 
sustainability and cumulative impacts and trying to identify whether 
there is a net benefit to Canada and seeking that elusive ‘<b>social license</b>.’”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leach said Ottawa 
apparently wants to reconcile the overlapping and conflicting 
jurisdictional roles for the provinces, municipalities and indigenous 
groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Indeed it appears that 
indigenous groups are being offered a much greater role in the review 
and approval process.&nbsp; Environmental and community opposition 
groups will have more opportunities to participate in the review 
process,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“To address obvious 
concerns that major projects attracting federal scrutiny will not be 
endlessly tied up in opposition, the proposals offer a new review 
process that starts with a ‘planning phase’ which would see early 
engagement with affected communities, such as indigenous groups, and 
attempts to head off major obstacles and create opportunities for a 
re-think or re-design before too much time and money has been invested,”
 Leach added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The second phase would 
be a ‘study phase’ which would be similar to the current processes which
 would look at the project in detail.&nbsp; The final phase is the 
‘decision phase’ where project approval would be rejected or granted and
 appeal to the federal cabinet for those disappointed in the decision.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oilsands and pipelines</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel said each 
region of the country added particular concerns and issues with Alberta 
focused on resource development, especially the oilsands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Alberta found us fully engaged in matters around oil and <b>gas</b>
 development and, in particular, issues related to developments in Fort 
McMurray. Indigenous peoples in both Calgary and Fort McMurray stressed 
the problems brought on by the fast pace of development and cumulative 
impacts from many unassessed activities, such as in situ&nbsp;oil 
extraction facilities,” the panel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They found themselves 
asked to review thousands of pages of reports and data with few 
resources and even less time. In short, they were overwhelmed by what 
they faced. Some of the companies that presented before us understood 
the dilemma faced by indigenous groups and attempted to address it 
within their own processes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Overall, the pace and 
extent of development confounded the federal environmental assessment 
process as it pertains to development in the Athabasca region.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel said that more meaningful public participation in the assessment process is a must.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“An overarching criterion
 of public participation opportunities in IA processes is that these 
opportunities must be ‘meaningful,’” the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A meaningful 
participation process needs to have the inherent potential to influence 
decisions made throughout the assessment, provide inclusive and 
accessible opportunities for early and on-going engagement from the 
public and indigenous groups, and provide the capacity required for 
active participation in the engagement.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel said current 
rules regarding public participation are lacking and have been perceived
 as having been designed to “limit public participation in the 
assessment process.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel believes the adoption of the “standing test” by the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span> (<span class="companylink">NEB</span>) has greatly hindered trust in the assessments the <span class="companylink">NEB</span> conducts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The degree to which this test has limited participation is evident through <span class="companylink">NEB</span>
 participation data. The outcome of this is not an efficient assessment 
process or timely incorporation of public input into a decision-making 
process,” the panel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In the case of the Trans Mountain Expansion Project review, a ministerial panel was convened after the <span class="companylink">NEB</span> assessment process was completed, at least in part to hear from those who felt shut out of the initial process.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In short, limiting 
public participation reduces the trust and confidence in assessment 
processes without bringing any obvious process efficiency.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel noted that the Trans Mountain Expansion Project review initially received 2,118 applications to participate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Out of these, 400 were 
granted intervenor status (which includes the right to file written 
evidence, cross-examine evidence and present written and oral 
arguments), 798 were granted commenter status (which gives the right to 
file a single letter of comment), 452 asked to be intervenors but were 
granted commenter status, and 468 applications were denied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first Energy East and
 Eastern Mainline project review received 2,652 applications to 
participate, out of which 1,450 were form letters. Out of these, 337 
were granted intervenor status (which includes the right to file written
 evidence, cross-examine evidence and present written and oral 
arguments), 190 were granted commenter status (which gives the right to 
file a letter of comments and file comments on draft conditions of 
approval), 81 asked to be intervenors but were granted commenter status,
 and “the other applications were denied participation” in the formal 
process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The panel recommends 
that IA legislation require that IA provide early and ongoing 
participation opportunities that are open to all,” the report said. 
“Results of public participation should have the potential to impact 
decisions.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other report highlights</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current process, put 
in place by the Conservative government in 2012, requires environmental 
assessments of projects such as pipelines that occur on federal lands to
 be completed within one or two years, depending on the project's size 
and complexity. “This has not met the objective of delivering cost and 
time certainty to proponents,” the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our recommended approach
 seeks to build public confidence in the assessment process. We believe 
that public trust can lead to more efficient and timely reviews. It may 
also support getting resources to market.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel recommends that
 a single authority have the mandate to conduct and decide upon IAs on 
behalf of the federal government. According to the report, the IA 
authority should be established as a quasi-judicial tribunal empowered 
to undertake a full range of facilitation and dispute-resolution 
processes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One suggestion is that 
there is one authority that does assessments,” McKenna&nbsp;said. “We 
have heard from Canadians and their concerns about the assessment 
process. We need to rebuild public trust and we take their suggestions 
seriously."&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel also outlined 
that, as it listened to presenters and read the many submissions 
presented, “we came to understand that any new effective assessment 
process must be governed by four fundamental principles. IA processes 
must be transparent, inclusive, informed and meaningful.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the next section, 
Developing the Vision, the panel outlined recommendations about the 
purpose of IA, the importance of co-operation among jurisdictions, 
integrating indigenous considerations into IA processes, enabling 
meaningful participation and ensuring evidence-based decision-making.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Each of these aspects is
 fundamental to ensuring that federal IA is robust and responds 
effectively to what we heard across the country,” the panel said in its 
report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel noted that IA 
aims to identify and address potential issues and concerns early in the 
design of projects, plans and policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In so doing, it can 
contribute to the creation of positive relationships among various 
interest groups, including reconciliation between indigenous peoples and
 non-indigenous peoples,” the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“IA also aims to 
contribute to the protection of the bio-physical environment and the 
long-term well-being of Canadians by gathering proper information to 
inform decision-making.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a project scale, the 
panel said IA should improve project design and ensure appropriate 
mitigation measures and monitoring programs are implemented. In sum, IA 
processes should give “Canadians confidence that projects, plans and 
policies have been adequately assessed,” the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As well, federal IAs 
require clear direction on both the purpose and parameters of the 
process. There are many options on how best to do IA. In considering the
 future of IA in Canada, the panel said it is necessary to begin by 
answering the following fundamental questions through a consideration of
 jurisdiction, significance and sustainability, and IA’s role as a 
planning tool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increased focus on indigenous participation is a must</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding ways to enhance 
indigenous participation and consultation was identified as a key goal 
in the panel’s terms of reference, as was reflecting the principles of 
the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
(UNDRIP), “especially with respect to the manner in which environmental 
assessment processes can be used to address potential impacts to 
potential or established Aboriginal or treaty rights.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel recognized that there are broader discussions that need to occur between the <span class="companylink">Government of Canada</span>
 and indigenous peoples with respect to nation-to-nation relationships, 
overlapping and unresolved claims to Aboriginal rights and title, 
reconciliation, treaty implementation and the broader implementation of 
UNDRIP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the panel, 
many of these discussions will be necessary prerequisites to the full 
and effective implementation of the recommendations contained in this 
report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among its recommendations
 regarding indigenous people, the panel suggests that indigenous peoples
 be included in “decision-making at all stages of IA, in accordance with
 their own laws and customs.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As well, IA processes 
need to require the assessment of impacts to asserted or established 
Aboriginal or treaty rights and interests across all components of 
sustainability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inter-governmental challenges</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regarding the purpose of IA, the panel recommends that:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal interest be central in determining whether an IA should be required for a given project, region, plan or policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal IA should begin 
with a legislated planning phase that, for projects, occurs early in 
project development before design elements are finalized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sustainability be central
 to IA. The likelihood of consequential impacts on matters of federal 
interest should determine whether an IA would be required.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal IA decide whether a project should proceed based on that project’s contribution to sustainability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IA legislation require the use of strategic and regional IAs to guide project IA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel said IA 
“creates challenges for Canada’s system of government,” with the 
requirement that a broad range of information be collected and evaluated
 but with no government having full authority to regulate all impacts. 
Federal, provincial, territorial, municipal and indigenous governments 
may each have responsibility for the conduct of IA, but each level of 
government can only regulate matters within its jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The principle of “one 
project, one assessment” is central to implementing IA around the five 
pillars of sustainability [environment, economy, social, cultural and 
health],” the panel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Grounding federal IA in 
legal jurisdiction, starting early in planning and focusing on assessing
 contributions to sustainability make co-operation among jurisdictions 
essential to ensure Canadians realize the benefits from IA.”</p>

 per cent of Alberta is based on bitumen in someway and if bitumen isn't
 working, our economy doesn't work anymore. We can lift the value of 
bitumen by managing CO2, make something of value, and make something we 
can transport with existing infrastructure," MacGregor said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm all for pipelines, 
I'm all for all railways, I'm all for anything that gets (product) out 
of Alberta, but we don't know if they'll let us do that or not - and if 
they don't let us, I still want have an Alberta as good for my kids as 
it was for me."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likening bitumen to the 
consistency of chilled peanut butter, MacGregor said the low-value 
product is high in carbon dioxide and it's sold to a low price U.S. 
market. Converting bitumen to diesel will help the company and the 
province succeed. Making that move would be the equivalent of $20 
billion in bitumen sales annually to $70 billion in diesel each year. 
The CEO would also like the government to start behaving and acting like
 an owner, as they will receive 25 per cent in royalties from each 
barrel sold because of invested feedstock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we charge them the 
cost of what it would be to convert it to diesel, on 37,000 barrels a 
day, they make around $150 million more a year than they would by 
selling it as (bitumen). That's what they have to do. They have to get 
that money to fix the problems we got now," he explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added <b>social license</b>
 is already in place to ship diesel worldwide with more than 1,500 
tankers departing from the B.C. coast each year in comparison to seeking
 new pipeline routes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With <span class="companylink">ExxonMobil</span>
 recently announcing marking down their bitumen reserves while investing
 $20 billion in new refinery upgrades in the Gulf Coast, MacGregor is 
concerned how long it will take Canada to make more valuable products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're saying they have
 enough land in the U.S. to produce the oil they need in the U.S. and to
 refigure their refineries to do so. That's really bad news for us," he 
said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North West Refining CEO sees ACTL as company's future</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The refinery will be 
integrated with the Alberta Carbon Trunk Line (ACTL) which is considered
 to be the gold standard for CO2 management and environmental 
performance. It will capture carbon dioxide during the refining process 
rather than venting the <b>gas</b> into the atmosphere and then it can 
be used for enhanced oil recovery and be permanently stores. The company
 is betting it will keep value and jobs in the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This means the fuels 
produced at the Sturgeon Refinery can now have one of the lowest CO2 
footprints," said Alyssa Haunholter, VP of government and stakeholder 
relations with North West Refining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"(ACTL) will be the 
world's largest system for managing man-made CO2. The system is designed
 to collect CO2 from industrial sources and transport it to central and 
southern Alberta where there are depleted oil fields nearing abandonment
 that can be re-invigorated by injecting CO2 before the CO2 is 
permanently stored. Once the CO2 infrastructure is operational it will 
prove to be a significant economic advantage in attracting new 
value-adding industries to Alberta that want to mitigate their CO2 
footprints and costs," she explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ACTL is similar to <span class="companylink">Shell</span>'s
 Carbon Capture and Storage project, however it will use the CO2 to get 
more oil out of fields in central Alberta before permanently storing it.
 The method is known as carbon capture utilization and storage. It will 
be capable of moving 40,000 CO2 tonnes daily, which MacGregor said is 
like taking every car off the road in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think that's just the
 start of this and it could be a lot bigger than that," MacGregor said. 
"The CO2 part of the system is really where the future is. If we don't 
get that right, then we won't be able to sell the things we make because
 they won't meet the low carbon fuel standards and we'll start competing
 with ourselves on price."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ACTL is in the final 
stages of closing a financing deal and once financing arrangements are 
complete, the project construction will resume and will last for 
approximately one year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phase 1 nearing completion</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, North West 
Refining's project is 90 per cent to completion. Turnover of facilities 
from construction to operations is underway, which includes operational 
staff simulator training, 1,260 turnover completion packages, more than 
15,000 loop checks, more than 1,200 motor runs, and more than 3,300 
operating procedures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To put it into 
perspective we have to do 15,000 loop checks. We have a control panel 
that says this is the value, we have to check that valve talks to the 
control panel and the panel moves it in the right way when we push the 
button. There are 15,000 of those things to do," MacGregor explained. 
"We're going to have problems out there when we started up, they won't 
be fatal problems because it's just what we do. There's no big 
'go'button that we push and the whole thing to run. There are 15,000 
things to check."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After three years of 
construction since 2014, more than 22 million field construction hours 
were logged at the end of January 2017, with the peak labour force of 
7,500 workers on site in 2016. Overall there were 76,000 construction 
jobs. That totalled more than $2.5 billion in employment for Albertans 
for Phase 1 and another 6,700 jobs are slated for operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also spurred $1.9 
billion in revenue for the government during construction and once 
operational it will generate $385 million annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discussions to move 
forward with the refinery's Phase 2 will take place in the coming weeks 
and the company is positioning itself to make an official ask for the 
government's backing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Haunholter, 
the company needs to secure support for another 30-year bitumen 
processing agreement with the Province of Alberta in order for Phase 2 
to move forward.</p>

 turnaround is complete, according to RBC Dominion Securities analyst 
Paul Treiber.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Believing
 its focus now shifts to the growth of its software business, Mr. 
Treiber removed the “speculative risk” qualifier from his “sector 
performer” rating for the Waterloo, Ont.-based tech company following 
better-than-anticipated fourth-quarter 2017 financial results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The risks with <span class="companylink">BlackBerry</span>’s
 turnaround appear to have diminished,” he said. “The company is no 
longer dependent on SAF-related cashflow, and the liability from 
hardware has been largely eliminated.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, <span class="companylink">BlackBerry</span>
 reported quarterly non-GAAP revenue of $297-million (U.S.), a drop of 1
 per cent from the previous quarter and a 39-per-cent decline year over 
year. However, the result topped the Street’s projection of $289-million
 and Mr. Treiber’s estimate of $276-million. He attributed the beat to 
higher-than-anticipated revenue from its Mobility Solutions segment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjusted earnings before 
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $42-million was also 
higher than the Street’s expectation ($30-million). Adjusted earnings 
per share of 4 cents topped the projection of both Mr. Treiber and the 
Street of nil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Q4 segmented Software 
&amp; Services revenue rose 1 per cent quarter over quarter to 
$166-million non-GAAP, below our $180-million estimate and the Street at
 $184-million,” said Mr. Treiber. “Segmented software revenue is up only
 7 per cent year over year. <span class="companylink">BlackBerry</span> 
disclosed $193-million ‘company total’ software and services revenue, 
which includes $27-million professional services recognized in Mobility 
Solutions. While professional services is potentially a leading 
indicator of future software growth, we put more emphasis on Q4 
segmented Software &amp; Services revenue because it provides insight on
 momentum in <span class="companylink">BlackBerry</span>’s recurring enterprise software, automotive/QNX, and Radar/IoT revenue.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Opex declined 8 per cent
 quarter over quarter to $183-million Q4, below our estimate of 
$190-million. The decrease reflects the shift of 400 handset-related 
employees in Mobility Solutions to <span class="companylink">Ford</span> (we estimate $10-million per quarter opex savings). The move reduces the exit liability from hardware. Additionally, <span class="companylink">BlackBerry</span>
 is no longer dependent on SAF revenue as a lifeline; SAF revenue 
declined 27 per cent quarter quarter to $49-million (down 66 per cent 
year over year), which was in line with our estimate of $50-million. Our
 outlook calls for SAF to decline to just 11 per cent of total revenue 
FY18.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, <span class="companylink">BlackBerry</span>’s view for 2018 meets the Street’s expectations, said Mr. Treiber.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“<span class="companylink">BlackBerry</span>
 sees software revenue up 13–15 per cent for fiscal 2018 and is 
comfortable with Street estimates for FY18 revenue and adjusted EPS,” 
the analyst said. “Incremental growth drivers include sustained 
professional services, initial handset licensing, and some contribution 
from Radar/IoT.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Emerging software 
opportunities difficult to value. Automotive appears a large potential 
opportunity (4–5 times current business) as <span class="companylink">BlackBerry</span> moves from infotainment to telematics, ADAS [advanced driver assistance systems], and connected vehicle portals. The <span class="companylink">Ford</span> agreement is a tangible sign that <span class="companylink">BlackBerry</span>
 is becoming more strategic with automakers. CEO John Chen believes 
agreements are ‘likely’ with other automakers. However, QNX is still 
relatively small (estimated $100-million revenue FY17) and Radar has 
nominal revenue currently; pending better visibility, we believe it is 
too difficult for investors to accurately value these opportunities.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In reaction to the 
results and guidance, Mr. Treiber adjusted his 2018 revenue and EPS 
projections to $978-million and 2 cents, respectively, from $965-million
 and 3 cents. For 2019, his estimates moved to $968-million and 10 cents
 from $1.029-billion and 7 cents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His target price for the stock rose to $8 from $7.50. The analyst consensus price target is $8, according to <span class="companylink">Thomson Reuters</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, Canaccord Genuity analyst T. Michael Walkley also raised his target price to $8 (from $7) with a “hold” rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“<span class="companylink">BlackBerry</span>
 reported better than expected Q4/ F’17 revenue of $297-million versus 
our $271-million estimate due to a better than expected combination of 
professional services revenue and slightly higher than expected device 
sales,” said Mr. Walkley. “Professional services revenue relates to the 
implementation of software subscription/licenses revenue and was 
$27-million in Q4/F’17. We expect a greater level of sustained 
professional services revenue with the business model transition towards
 recurring revenue software subscriptions. Following <span class="companylink">BlackBerry</span>’s
 three licensing agreements for mobile devices, we expect an initial 
licensing ramp from the Indonesia JV with potential for volumes to ramp 
towards the end of FY18 primarily from Southeast Asia. For FY18, 
management expects software and services revenue growth of 10-15 per 
cent with a target towards the higher end of the range or 13-15 per 
cent. This growth is off the base of $687-million from FY17 or the 
combination of software subscription/license revenue and professional 
services related to the implementation of these products. Following the 
restructuring, we expect ongoing costs related to software development 
for mobility solutions, and we continue to expect device sales to end in
 Q3/FY18.”</p>

 Rosemont asset in Arizona.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Released on March 30, Mr.
 Baretto said the Rosemont update shows the impact of “strained 
economics,” featuring a shorter mine line with higher development costs 
and all-in sustaining costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The plan has been 
optimized to pull forward higher grades (and thereby recoveries) earlier
 in the mine life,” the analyst said. “As such, average annual copper 
production over the first 10 years is expected to be 127,00 tons, with 
average AISC of $1.59 per pound. HBM projects overall capex at 
$1.92-billion, versus our previous estimate of $1.65-billion. The higher
 project cost has been attributes to various elements, including design 
features to appease the regulators (e.g. all infrastructure must be 
covered, with no line of sight to the other side of the ridge), as well 
as higher pre-stripping requirements and higher labour costs. We also 
believe that the capex estimate contains a significant element of 
conservatism.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on the study, Mr. 
Baretto’s new valuation for HudBay’s attributable share of Rosemont is 
$478-million, or $2.69 per share, which represents a 48-per-cent decline
 from his previous estimate of $928-million ($5.99 per share).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our $476-million 
valuation compares to the $500-million HBM paid to acquire the Rosemont 
project,” he said. “We note that our valuation for Rosemont would be 
$712-million if discounted to the start of construction (instead of 
today), in line with HBM’s valuation of $719-million. Based on the 
revised study and discussions with the regulators HBM believes it is 
likely that they will have the federal permits in hand sometime this 
year. However, the company does not intend to begin significant 
construction activity without a clear line of sight to $3.00 per pound 
copper. We forecast construction to begin in 2020, with production 
beginning in 2023. HBM expects to fund Rosemont through the existing SLW
 stream, JV contributions, equipment financing, and operating cash flow.
 Our revised estimates support this assertion.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Mr. Baretto said he’s “intrigued by the possibilities” of both its Lalor mine and New Britannia mill in Manitoba.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The Lalor study as 
currently published only reflects Phase 1 of a two-phase optimization 
process,” he said. “As such, we do not believe it is representative of 
what the ultimate production profile of the complex looks like, and so 
despite the decisions that still need to be made around Phase 2, we have
 updated our estimates to reflect what we believe the ultimate 
production profile could look like based on the information available to
 date. We assume New Britannia and associated infrastructure will be 
operational by early 2019, and designed a mine plan around this which 
has had a positive impact on our overall Manitoba valuation. We now 
value the Manitoba business $1.16-billion ($6.52 per share), a 
27-per-cent increase from our previous valuation of $913-million ($5.14 
per share).”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on the results of 
the update, Mr. Baretto’s 2017 and 2018 EBITDA projections fell to 
$516.8-million and $569.6-million, respectively, from $521.5-million and
 $609.7-million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He kept a “buy” rating for the stock and lowered his target price by a loonie to $11. Consensus is $8.90.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While the Rosemont 
feasibility update was disappointing, we are encouraged by the 
possibilities offered by New Britannia and the implied cash flows over 
the near to medium term,” he said. “We continue to like HBM for its 
leverage to copper and zinc prices as well as its relatively inexpensive
 near-term valuation. We reiterate our buy rating, but … are reducing 
our target price to $11 per share. We note that our revised target still
 offers 26-per-cent upside to the current share price.”</p>

 stock has “significantly” outperformed its peers this year, leading <span class="companylink">BMO</span>
 Nesbitt Burns analyst Ben Pham to downgrade it to “underperform” from 
“market perform.”“ATCO shares have performed well this year with strong 
Q4/16 results and a 15-per-cent dividend increase in January,” said Mr. 
Pham. “Prospective growth opportunities have also gained momentum and 
improved sentiment towards Alberta-exposed companies have helped boosted
 the shares. As a result, the stock is up [approximately] 16 per cent 
year to date 2017, a material outperformance relative to peers, the 
S&amp;P/TSX Utilities Index return of 6 per cent, and the broader 
Canadian market return of 2 per cent.”Mr. Pham expects the near-term 
earnings growth for Atco, a Calgary-based infrastructure solutions 
company, to moderate. He did indicate, however, that growth 
opportunities will likely be available in the longer term.“Super-normal 
growth in Alberta-regulated utility has driven strong earnings and cash 
flow growth over the past few years,” the analyst said. “Whether the 
same set of assets can sustain that performance or not may determine the
 magnitude of earnings growth over the next few years. Though growth is 
still available and the company has limited direct commodity price 
exposure (mainly via Alberta power), with earnings largely generated in 
Alberta, ATCO cannot escape the indirect impacts of the recent commodity
 downturn. This dynamic could set ATCO on a more modest growth pace 
relative to the past, in our opinion. More specifically, <b>gas</b> pipeline infrastructure spending in Alberta remains robust on growing consumption of <b>gas</b>
 and need for modernization, but electric transmission has slowed down 
dramatically; ATCO was investing $1.3-billion in wires transmission per 
annum from 2012-2014 leading to abnormal 32-per-cent rate base growth, 
but capital spending requirements are now $400-million per annum. ATCO 
Structures and the Alberta merchant power assets are performing below 
their earnings capability, but that dynamic could persist at least 
through late decade given the slowdown in energy-related project 
activity. A decline in realized ROEs will also compound these issues in 
the near term. ATCO historically has earned 11-14-per-cent regulated 
equity returns on success in cost savings and efficiencies, well above 
the mid-8-per-cent allowed level. Given management’s strong track 
record, we believe outperformance should continue but we anticipate a 
downward trajectory on returns through late decade especially upon 
re-basing of Alberta distribution assets into the second generation of 
performance-based regulation. Given ATCO’s high regulated exposure (81 
per cent of earnings) and $12-billion in rate base in Alberta, even a 
modest change in Alberta-regulated returns could materially impact ATCO 
earnings: every 50 bps in ROE [return on equity] is about 12 cents EPS 
(or 4 per cent).”“Luckily, ATCO has a significant inventory of 
prospective growth opportunities that could emerge over the longer term.
 We previously highlighted ATCO’s proposed cogeneration plant associated
 with a proposed polypropylene facility In the Industrial Heartland that
 could represent a $500-million-plus capital investment. Further, 
Alberta’s goals to significantly add renewables to the power system by 
2030 is directionally positive for large-scale hydro projects like 
ATCO’s 1,800MW Slave River facility and for conversions of coal power 
facilities to natural <b>gas</b> such as the Battle River 5 plant. We 
are also still optimistic on the need for the Mexico Tula Cogeneration 
project on increased <b>gas</b> consumption needs, though we believe 
ATCO will be more careful in the country given recent significant cost 
overruns with the Tula pipeline. All of these opportunities are 
possibilities but are merely speculative at this point or are too early 
in the development stage to reflect in the current valuation and 
shares.”Mr. Pham’s target for the stock remains $46. The analyst average
 price target is $48.60, according to Bloomberg.“Following the latest 
run-up in share price, the stock now trades at a 15.5-times P/E 
[price-to-earnings] multiple and a discount to NAV [net asset value] of 
&nbsp;7 per cent,” he said. “This is a significant improvement from 
beginning of 2016 levels of 11.7x forward P/E and a discount to NAV of 
22 per cent. It is not unusual to see companies trade at higher 
valuations relative to historical norms due to change in business mix 
and/or improved growth prospects. For example, Boralex has experienced a
 structural improvement in market valuation multiple on higher 
contracted exposure (98 per cent from 50 per cent), improved trading 
liquidity, and enhanced growth prospects. Similarly, <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>
 experienced a boost in sentiment following last year’s blockbuster 
Columbia Pipeline acquisition that accelerated dividend growth while 
reducing direct commodity price exposure. Going back to ATCO, we believe
 the business mix has improved (i.e., higher regulated exposure), 
warranting improved relative valuation, but we think this is partially 
offset by lower growth expectations relative to peers. Given the 
relative forward P/E and low discount to NAV, we believe the stock is 
fully valued at current levels or at least have limited relative upside 
potential from here.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our buy rating on AC is

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“U.S. network peers have

 been thrown into overcapacity as new entrant <span class="companylink">Hong Kong Airlines</span> and other Chinese players ramp capacity (alongside <span class="companylink">Air Canada</span>).”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on his findings,

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====Calling its Horne 5 project “an overlooked” gold development, <span class="companylink">BMO</span> Nesbitt Burns analyst Andrew Mikitchook initiated coverage of <span class="companylink">Falco Resources Ltd</span>.

(http://www.theglobeandmail.com.ezproxy.lib.ucalgary.ca/globe-investor/markets/stocks/summary/?q=FPC-X[http://www.theglobeandmail.com.ezproxy.lib.ucalgary.ca/globe-investor/markets/stocks/summary/?q=FPC-X]))

 100-per-cent-owned Horne 5 deposit, located in Quebec, is one of the 
few 200,000 ounce-plus per year gold development assets in North 
America, and is fast tracking toward a construction decision and 
targeting potential commercial production in 2021,” he said. “The Horne 5
 PEA (2016) showed average gold production of 236,000 ounces (Peak of 
274,000 ounces per year) at a low US$427/oz by-product AISC due to 
significant by-products with a capex of $905-million. The company is 
preparing to deliver a feasibility study in Q2 to define reserves and 
initiate the permitting process as well as pre construction activities. 
With the appointment of Osisko-related management in 2014 and 2015, 
Falco gained a team with a track record of engineering, permitting, 
financing, and construction with recent success at the Malartic mine 67 
kilometres to the east of the Horne 5 project. In our opinion, 
navigating community relations in Quebec to gain <b>social license</b> 
and support for development is among the team's key strengths. While the
 Horne 5 project is within Rouyn-Noranda city limits, its location 
within an industrial part of the town and smaller footprint should be a 
simpler challenge than the partial town relocation managed for Canadian 
Malartic.”Called its current valuation “compelling” while waiting for 
“derisking,” Mr. Mikitchook set a price target of $1.90. The average is 
$1.83.“We have chosen a 0.6 times P/NAV [price-to-net asset value] 
target-setting multiple to reflect development risks, primarily in terms
 of scale and financing the Horne 5 project,” he said. “This multiple 
would be toward the lower end used in the <span class="companylink">BMO</span>
 coverage universe for advanced projects at or approaching a feasibility
 stage. We would look to increase our target-setting multiple as Falco 
delivers a feasibility study in Q2 and secures financing to carry out 
dewatering and headframe construction, which are expected to start in 
Q4/17.”</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Northwest Territories government is taking advantage of the downturn in the oil and <b>gas</b>
 industry to move forward with initiatives designed to improve the 
business case for petroleum development in the territories, says the 
minister in charge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In today’s market, the viability of oil and <b>gas</b>
 faces serious challenges,” Wally Schumann, minister of industry, 
tourism and investment (ITI) said in a keynote address to the Canadian 
Institute’s Arctic Oil &amp; <b>Gas</b> Symposium last week.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This summer the government intends to introduce a balanced “made-in-the NWT approach” to oil and <b>gas</b>
 development in the territories, he said. It will come in the form of a 
new strategy created and informed through direct engagement with 
industry, NWT leaders, Aboriginal leaders and the government’s many oil 
and <b>gas</b> stakeholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our strategy represents an approach to oil and <b>gas</b>
 development in the NWT that residents and business both support and can
 benefit from and one that will help restore investor confidence and 
investment in our territories,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government intends to
 exercise its new legislative authority to shape a stronger investment 
landscape for the North, Schumann told the conference. It has already 
begun to enhance the legislative framework governing oil and <b>gas</b> 
development in the NWT, streamlining and strengthening the regulatory 
regime. “In part, our aim is to eliminate the redundancies in the 
regulatory process and modernize our act and work with contemporary 
market conditions.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another area, the GNWT
 also understands the importance of land use certainty and continues to 
settle outstanding land claims with its Aboriginal partners, he said. 
“The government’s relationship with Aboriginal governments and resource 
development is one through which it fosters the public support necessary
 for responsible resource projects to move forward.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NWT, said Schumann, 
is 1.3 million square kilometres of some of the world’s last stable 
untapped natural resource deposits, citing <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span> (<span class="companylink">NEB</span>) estimates of 16.2 tcf of marketable conventional natural <b>gas</b> and 1.2 billion bbls of marketable conventional oil that has already been discovered with more remaining to be found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The magnitude of its 
resources for unconventional source rock is even greater with median 
estimates of 191 billion bbls of oil equivalent in the Canol/Bluefish 
shale deposits in the Sahtu region of the Central Mackenzie Valley, he 
told the conference. “If even one per cent of these estimates are 
marketable, that means 1.9 billion bbls of product which we believe will
 attract investment, create jobs and business revenues for our 
governments and territories.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NWT government has 
already begun to make changes to its land tenure system which had 
required a formal process with set timelines for submissions of 
expressions of interest, followed by calls for bids, said Schumann.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Expressions of interest 
are always welcome on available lands and annual reminders will be soon 
on their way to encourage interest in prospective lands that would be 
included in the formal call for bids,” he said. “In total, the land 
available is nearly 100,000 square kilometres — an area larger than New 
Brunswick and Prince Edward Island combined.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Canol/Bluefish 
shale play in the Central Mackenzie Valley, some of the existing 
exploration licences have expired, offering an opportunity to explore 
petroleum-rich land, said Schumann. “We are prepared to work closely 
with anyone who wants to invest in this land.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of more attractive 
areas is the Liard Basin in the southern part of the territories but 
which also extends into British Columbia and Yukon because it is closer 
to existing infrastructure, Menzie McEachern, director of the Petroleum 
Resources division, told another session. The NWT’s share is an expected
 77 tcf of marketable natural <b>gas</b>. “Going forward, it’s a region in which industry is well advised to pursue exploration and development.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NWT Geological Survey
 plays an import role in defining the territories’ resources and making 
them available on their website, McEachern said. Last year, the 
three-member team completed a characterization of the Liard Basin and 
more recently it completed a play summary of the Canol shale which found
 that the liquids are closer to the Mackenzie River and the <b>gas</b> is closer to the Mackenzie Mountains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next areas of study 
will be the Mackenzie Plain, north and west of the current exploration 
focus in the Central Mackenzie Valley, and the Horn River Basin, to the 
east of the Liard Basin, also on the B.C. border.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McEachern’s division also
 has developed maps for download that show areas of high and very high 
petroleum potential along with areas that are available for expressions 
of interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government also is 
moving its promotional activity beyond Calgary and is starting to reach 
out internationally such as to oil and <b>gas</b> companies in China and Japan, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“[There’s an] 
&nbsp;understanding that the future demand for our resources likely will
 reside in Asia for the most part and so we want to target companies in 
that part of the world that are thinking long term about the energy 
needs of their people because we know that we can serve those markets 
going forward,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the most part, though, the needed oil and <b>gas</b>
 and energy infrastructure are not in place, Schumann acknowledged. 
That’s why the government is looking at the idea of transportation 
corridors — not just pipelines but highways, waterways, railways and 
fibre infrastructure — that would play an important role in realizing 
the North’s economic potential, the conference heard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another session, a veteran Arctic oil and <b>gas</b>
 explorer also had some ideas on how territorial governments north of 60
 can use the downturn to work on making their areas more attractive for 
development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think the biggest challenge we have in all three of the territories — but mostly in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories—is <b>social license</b>,” John Hogg, president of Calgary-based Skybattle Resources Inc., told the conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“People don’t understand oil and <b>gas</b> and when industry talks about oil and <b>gas</b>
 they don’t trust us because we are the industry and I am okay with 
that,” he said. “But there are champions within government and there are
 champions within the communities who understand what oil and <b>gas</b>
 is and I think that communities&nbsp; need to understand better what we
 do, how we do [it], how we are regulated and what’s the potential if we
 do have oil and <b>gas</b> development, long term jobs and how will that help the community.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That kind of discussion is needed and “if people don’t want oil and <b>gas</b>,
 that’s great,” he said. “But the last thing you want to see, which is 
what we have kind of seen, is people invite you in and then when there 
is too much activity, they want you to leave.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the government’s job, said Hogg, is to explain the implications for the community if they want oil and <b>gas</b>
 development beyond a company coming in periodically, drilling a dry 
hole and then leaving. That means, for example, saying that while there 
will be a lot more jobs, there also will be a lot more trucks, there 
will be more people in town, there will potentially [be] more criminal 
issues. “Then they can decide whether they want it [development].”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Governments, he said, should “spend more time talking to the communities about what this is and do they truly want it.” &nbsp;</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MERCEDES STEPHENSON: 
Well, it's time for our week-ending strategy session now with political 
commentator Gerry Nicholls coming to us from downtown Toronto. In Regina
 we have Sally Housser, a senior consultant with Navigator; and with me 
here as usual, in studio, Greg MacEachern with <span class="companylink">Environics Communications</span>
 . Greg, the prime minister down in Houston, he's getting an award. What
 is the award for that he's actually done? Is this a little bit more 
maybe of an optics thing that benefits him and the oil industry?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
GREG MACEACHERN (<span class="companylink">Environics Communications</span>
 ): This is probably one of the largest, if not the largest, energy 
conferences in the world. There's not a lot of low-hanging fruit there. 
You have to, the entry fee is, for example, quite high. I checked out 
the agenda. You're looking at the chair of the senate energy commission 
in the United States, people from Abu Dhabi, people from Russia, 
government officials from all over the world, so it's a huge 
opportunity. The previous government knew this as well, to give them 
full credit, they used this conference a lot as well. But we've our 
natural resources minister, Jim Carr , who's been there for the week. I 
think having the prime minister there certainly sent another message. 
And I would encourage people to check out Trudeau's speech, because he 
talked about the trade between the state of Texas and Canada, $35 
billion. I think he said 465,000 jobs are dependent on this. So there's 
another message besides energy. We've talked about this before, about 
this Canada-US unit, the policy unit that's in the PMO, and that they'll
 be targeting certain states with strong trading relationships so they 
remind President Trump when we're going into <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> . That was, I think, the subtext of that speech, and he seemed to be very well received.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STEPHENSON: Gerry, Conservatives must look at this and have a hard time finding fault with it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GERRY NICHOLLS (Political
 Commentator): Well I was kind of expecting, when Trudeau got this 
award, that somebody would come out and say no, no, no, Stephen Harper 
really won the award.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STEPHENSON: Did not happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NICHOLLS: But it didn't 
happen. I think Trudeau is doing really well at this event. He always 
does well when they go to these little foreign junkets. You know he's 
always well received, he always gets good press, so I think, yeah, this 
is a PR hit for Justin Trudeau , no question about it. But I think his 
little trip to Texas also kind of illustrates an inherent dilemma with 
Justin Trudeau 's grand communication strategy, and that strategy is 
basically that he wants everybody to like him. In this case he wants all
 these JR Ewings in Dallas to like him. He also wants Leonardo Dicaprios
 in Hollywood to like him. And I think at the end of the day he can't 
make them both happy. At the end of the day he's got to choose one side 
over the other. I think he's going to choose the JR Ewings, because that
 means investment in Canada, that means jobs in Canada, that means votes
 for the Liberal party, and it doesn't matter how green you are, votes 
matter. Just ask Kathleen Wynne in Ontario.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STEPHENSON: Sally, is 
this some brilliant PR by the PMO to get him this award? And is it going
 to catch up to him to balance this environment and the economy? So far 
it seems like he's Teflon on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SALLY HOUSSER (Navigator 
Ltd): I'm in the same hard position as Gerry here. There's only so much 
that you can be critical on this. He's down in Texas obviously selling 
Canadian industry. It's good for Alberta. It's good for the Canadian 
economy at large. Ultimately, though, his ability to straddle the line, 
you know, as you say, is interesting to me, but he does seem to be doing
 it. I think if you saw Stephen Harper down in Texas accepting an award 
from big oil and <b>gas</b>, there's probably not a whole lot of 
progressive people across the country, certainly in British Columbia, 
and Quebec, and Ontario that would still be looking fondly at the prime 
minister. So he's had that ability to do that. I think what was 
interesting about the talks, obviously more praise for what Rachel 
Notley has done in Alberta with taking real concrete action and 
providing that <b>social license</b> for pipeline approval, but what I 
think we're still waiting for from the federal government is those more 
concrete concepts of you can talk about the new economy and getting to 
renewables and a different type of resource economy, but without actual 
steps being taken to do that it's still just words at the moment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STEPHENSON: Okay, Greg, now I want to go back to something you brought up in your initial answer about <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> , because we heard today that the renegotiation of <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>
 seems to be moving ever closer. It was in the fall, maybe closer to 
December, now suddenly we're hearing June, July from US officials. What 
are you hearing, you've got great sources inside the government, about 
when this might happen, and how significant it might be for Canada? 
MACEACHERN: I think the biggest piece of news this week was we moved 
away from the over analysis of the word tweak to having someone from on 
behalf of the United States start talking about chapter, the chapters 
that are in <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> . I believe the 
secretary mentioned, for example, that he was looking for a chapter on 
digital economy, which I think is of interest for a lot of us who work 
in our day jobs with people that are trying to set up small businesses 
in Canada and move them online,. What does this actually mean? We don't 
know yet. The other thing is, is that if we're talking about tweaks 
versus chapters, when we're talking about chapters, I think for example 
chapter 11 which deals with investor state arbitration, and the legal 
geeks will tell us that the US usually wins when we, you know, Canada 
probably has a one in two chance of winning, the US usually wins on 
this. So there are some opportunities for Canada there if we are now 
talking about bigger, broader negotiations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STEPHENSON: Gerry, do you
 think it's a good thing that we're seeing dates on this and things are 
starting to move ahead, or is it a sign that this is something that is 
really urgent for the United States and it could be problematic for us?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NICHOLLS: Well I think, 
Mercedes, one of the problems has been uncertainty. What is Donald Trump
 going to do? What is this going to mean for <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>
 ? What is this going to mean for Canada-US relations? So I think 
probably the sooner we get into this, the sooner we start looking at the
 nuts and bolts of what the Americans want, the better. And I think on 
the positive side, that we will be heading into these talks in a pretty 
good climate, a pretty good environment, and I think a lot of that is 
because when Justin Trudeau went to Washington and visited President 
Trump, he kind of put a positive spin, a positive tone on the 
relationship, and I think that's going to help. Now I know a lot of 
people on the left are probably angry that they saw Justin Trudeau 
perhaps kowtowing Donald Trump in Washington. But I think what the prime
 minister did was he put the interests of the country first, and we'll 
see if that bears fruit down the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STEPHENSON: Okay. Sally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSSER: Yeah, I think 
what will be interesting is that moving from tweak, which Donald Trump 
talked about, and it's not particularly scary language, just a little 
finessing here or there, to what we're actually hearing now, which is 
there may be quite significant changes that have significant impacts on 
people all across Canada. I think what we've seen now is Justin Trudeau 
has made the gamble essentially that a softly, softly approach with 
Donald Trump and playing nice, and not being overly critical will help 
in these negotiations and other things about, you know, the cross-border
 tax and whatnot. But what we're going to see happen is if Canada loses 
out in these negotiations, if there's significantly negative impacts one
 way or the other, and frankly we're dealing with a president who I 
don't really think cares that much about Canada and what's good for us 
or not, and I think that's typical of any foreign leader, obviously 
you're concerned about your domestic causes, but if this ends up going 
quite poorly for Canada, Justin Trudeau has staked a lot of political 
capital on this approach. And I think people who are willing to give him
 the benefit of the doubt, and even kind of begrudgingly watching him 
playing nice with Donald Trump , will think about it quite differently 
if that strategy doesn't really pay off in the end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STEPHENSON: Well that wraps up another week of political intrigue and strategery with our strats. We'll see you next Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACEACHERN: Thank you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSSER: Thanks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STEPHENSON: Another 
scandal is brewing in the senate, and, no, this one is not 
expense-related. One senator under fire for breaching the chambers 
ethics code after an inquiry found that he had sex with a teenage girl. 
Now some of Don Meredith's colleagues are asking him to step down. We'll
 speak with one of them next.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Northern Miner: 
Thanks for joining us Mr. Lundin. We can begin with a retrospective 
onthe past five or six years. I wanted to ask about your experiences 
during the recent market downturn?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Lukas Lundin: It's been one of the more difficult cycles for mining in 
my mind, but we've done really well under those circumstances. We went 
out and acquired Candelaria and Eagle, and took the opportunity to move 
into Ecuador on the gold side and acquire FDL. It's all about taking 
advantage of opportunities and applying capital intelligently. These are
 assets that really only become available in truly tough environments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[caption id="attachment_1003659848" align="aligncenter" width="700"] The processing plant at <span class="companylink">Lundin Mining</span>'s 80%-owned Candelaria copper mine in northern Chile's Atacama province. Credit: Lundin Mining.[/caption]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Freeport-McMoRan</span> (NYSE: FCX) was over-leveraged following their oil and <b>gas</b>
 investments, and had to sell Candelaria. I don’t believe they wanted to
 sell the mine, but they had no choice. Those are the circumstances we 
always want to be involved in because you can acquire projects that 
wouldn't typically be available. Some people might say it's bold to go 
out and deploy significant capital in a down market, but to me it just 
makes sense. Commodities aren't going to disappear, and when you're in 
the industryfor a long time you become comfortable with the fact you're 
going to have to deal with business cycles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: It seems topical to 
mentionFreeport asset sales following the recent situation wherein you 
both divested ownership interests in the Tenke Fungurume copper-cobalt 
mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Did Freeport's decision 
to sell surprise you?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LL: Well, no not really. 
We knew that Freeport had a heavy debt load, so we were expecting some 
of that activity. We didn’t know who the buyer was, though.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When we found out it was 
China Molybdenum we decided it was best if we exited the situation. We 
really enjoyed working with Freeport, but I don't think we wanted to 
work with anybody else down there. Following that event, however, 
wewould like to find another copper asset if it makes sense. There's 
just not a lot out there right now, and that's especially true given our
 focus on cost discipline. I mean we could look at higher-cost copper 
assets, but we've been tentative in doing that. I'm getting the 
impression it's going to have to be something more greenfield now. We

but unfortunately we lost out on it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: We saw improvements 
in mining markets, both in terms of equity valuations and metal prices, 
over 2016. Where do you feel we are now and how are you strategically 
approaching markets today?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LL: I think we're at the 
beginning of a new cycle, and we're still far away from the highs we saw
 five or six years ago. When I look at that scenario I see a lot more 
room for improvement and the opportunity to participate in rising 
markets. For example, I believe we've seen a broad under-investment in 
copper for a long period here, and demand isn't going anywhere. I'm not 
someone who makes predictions on when exactly we'll see that spark 
again, but we're confident it's coming and you don't want to miss out on
 what should be a really strong copper price recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That being said, it's 
becoming tougher to find quality projects. I think the real opportunity 
was around nine months ago, but that doesn't mean we can't uncover 
potentially great deals out there. I've always worked to make sure we 
have strong access to capital, and that's a real key to our success in 
these down markets. When other people are worried about capital markets,
 or access to cash, we remain in a position to make deals. I think you 
see that amongst the small group of core investors in mining that have 
taken advantage of some of these asset sales and acquisition 
opportunities in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: You’ve obviously 
been in the business for a long time, and have experienceda number of 
these business cycles. What changes have you seen over the past fifteen 
years?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LL: I guess the biggest 
change over the past ten to fifteen years is the emergence of China, 
which is really the over-arching driver of commodities now in many ways.
 That didn't exist in my previous business life, but there's not much 
you can do about it. We're in the commodity business so all we can do is
 strive to control costs and focus on greatassets. So we make that 
effort to remain in the lowest cost quartile. That's a big focus of our 
business, and I think a large contingent of our peer group lost sight of
 that, at times, during stronger economic periods over the past decade. 
Even when things are going well on a broader level it remains important 
to watch costs because the next down market could be right around the 
corner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Social and political 
issues have also really come to the forefront for all of us, I think. We
 always strive to be responsible in our business, but things are 
changing rapidly. So when we’re making acquisitions in jurisdictions 
like Ecuador, which may have been perceived as risky previously, we’re 
really putting even more due diligence into governmental and regulatory 
issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: I’d be interested in a little colour on the due diligence in Ecuador and your experiences so far with Lundin Gold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LL: Well, Fruta is a very
 good metal deposit, and those are becoming increasingly harder to find.
 We talked about how the situation in Ecuador had been a bit sticky, and
 I think previous owners and the government can take a share of the 
blame there. But we saw opportunity, and went down there to meet with 
the government to see if they were interested in mining investment. The 
response was really positive. The government seems pro-business to me, 
and they’re keen to kick-start a new segment of the economy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many ways, we enter 
developing jurisdictions as educators, and we focus really heavily on 
social issues from thestart. For us mining is almost secondary at this 
stage because you have to introduce people to the industry and dispel 
some of the preconceptions, or misconceptions, about the business. 
People talk about the capital cost of [<b>social license</b>,] but the 
more important aspect for me is having the right people on the ground. 
You can invest in building schools and hospitals, but at the same time 
it's really about educating and informing on many levels. Ecuador is 
working toward establishing that regulatory and legislative 
infrastructure, and I get the impression they are legitimately 
interested in creating a mining industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: You’re also assessing potential financing for FDL, and I wanted to ask your opinion on where capital markets are currently?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LL: In terms of capital 
markets we’re definitely seeing improvements. I always like Toronto 
because they know the business well. New York has deep pockets, as long 
as you don't get money that is too fast. Europe has always been good to 
us, especially Sweden and London. Overall things have gotten better. It 
was really dead around six months ago, but I've seen a shift in 
sentiment in both energy and metals. There's some more generalist 
investment interest, though I don't think it's quite there yet. I always
 say, however, that when generalists come into the market it's time to 
sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: You had previously mentioned looking at new copper opportunities. What other commodities are interesting to you right now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LL: I like the 
fundamentals in zinc because from where I'm standing we're looking at a 
shortage. It's one of those metals where you tend to have one year of 
glory and ten years of misery. I think we may be approaching one of 
those glory periods. I know we've been hearing about a zinc rebound for a
 while, but we've had those material shut-downs of large-scale, 
long-life operations recently that change the fundamentals. We're always
 looking at China's impact on zinc markets, but they tend to have 
smaller-scale operations that are expensive. I don't think their impact 
on supply will be as pronounced this time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, <span class="companylink">uranium equities</span>
 have been very, very beaten up. We've seen some recovery, but in my 
opinion we've still got quite a ways to go in terms of re-balancing 
those valuations. It's one space I'm still really optimistic on because 
from what I'm seeing we've got a lot of space for growth and market 
improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: Uranium has definitely been something of a contrarian play recently. Could you elaborate on your investment thesis?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LL: It's been a tough three to four years here for uranium, but I feel we've really seen a turning point with the <span class="companylink">Kazatomprom</span>
 production cuts. It's funny because when I started in the business 
twenty-years ago Kazakhstan wasn't even a player, and then that segment 
of supply almost came out of nowhere to become a major global production
 centre. I always say uranium is a difficult business to understand 
because there seems to be unknowns on the supply side in terms of 
stockpiles and things coming out of the proverbial bush to shock the 
market. Denison has really become predominantly focused on the Athabasca
 Basin because from my point of view you have to focus on the best 
deposits in the world. I've done uranium deals globally, but during the 
downturn it really became apparent to me that Saskatchewan is where you 
want to be.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: How do you feel more broadly about Canada as a mining jurisdiction right now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LL: I still think Canada 
is a good jurisdiction, but the permitting is just so slow. It's become 
quite difficult to advance through the regulatory process, and the <b>social license</b>
 issues can be quite exhausting in terms of time and capital. You need a
 lot of patience, but it's a great place to work in terms of knowledge 
about our business. If I were to give some advice, I'd say it would be 
nice if the regulators and government could work on permittingframeworks
 because the time frames can be prohibitive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: Thanks again for joining us, Mr. Lundin.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While
 the idea of innovation appeals to people across many fields, it brings 
with it many myths, according to one panelist, who said a common myth is
 that innovation simply means gadgets. “I say ‘gadget’ and you conjure 
up an image of your iPhone,” said Bryan Helfenbaum, technology manager 
with <span class="companylink">Devon Canada Corporation</span> .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This notion of the 
[gadget] is everywhere, yet there are so many other kinds of innovation 
that we overlook or don’t think about,” he told the audience, mainly 
petroleum engineers from SPE Canada’s heavy oil and unconventional 
resource sections, along with colleagues from the United States and 
abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Process innovation was 
one example, Helfenbaum said, citing the assembly line that 
auto-industry pioneer Henry Ford pioneered early in the last century. 
Later, Helfenbaum showed a flow chart outlining a process for 
evaluating, piloting and commercializing innovation. “But it isn’t a 
process to come up with [innovation] in the first place,” he added. As 
individuals, he said most innovators have their own internal processes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the many myths of 
innovation, he counted the ‘epiphany,’ the so-called ‘ah-ha’ moment, 
when an inventor finally cracks a puzzle or gets the ‘big’ idea. Most of
 the time, though, ideas don’t spring suddenly into people’s heads, he 
said. Instead, it often happens that a longstanding problem has been 
turned over in someone’s mind for months or years before a solution 
arrives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Before [Archimedes] took
 his fateful bath, he tried to solve the problem a number of other ways,
 but he had tried and failed, tried and failed. With each failure, he 
learned and was building this puzzle in his head. So that final moment, 
the ‘eureka,’ or ah-ha moment, is just the last piece of the puzzle. The
 point? You can’t just sit in your office, wait for the heavens to part 
and [expect] the idea to come to you. You’ve got to try something.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another common myth is 
that most innovations succeed. The opposite is true, Helfenbaum argued, 
citing the hundreds or thousands of product failures that preceded 
familiar products like the iPhone. Recalling the structures of ancient 
Rome, he said we have developed a skewed view of their durability and 
permanence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For every Roman Coliseum
 still standing, there are tens of thousands of [Roman] structures that 
fell, but we have a skewed view today, because we only see the ones 
still standing. It’s then really intimidating when we [try to innovate] 
and don’t succeed on our first try.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To his audience, many of 
them technical innovators in heavy oil and the oilsands, Helfenbaum 
offered some parting advice. If they fail in trying to innovate, they 
should “fail fast, fail cheap and fail often — so long as you learn.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other panel members 
reminded the audience that innovation is something different from 
invention. Instead, it’s something that’s often built on our past 
achievements. “Innovating is not about inventing, creating or developing
 something new,” said Bill Whitelaw, chief executive of Bulletin 
publisher JWN. “It’s about renewal and about creating something from the
 past.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, 
Canada’s innovation industry today finds itself in a state of profound 
anxiety, he said. “Innovation has become a pack horse for everybody’s 
aspirations for the energy sector.” Yet, it’s one of the oil industry’s 
great stories to tell, “and we need to get better at it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other panelists saw 
innovation as something essentially disruptive. One example cited was 
Thomas Edison’s invention of the light bulb, which displaced much older 
coal <b>gas</b> and kerosene lamps, said Catherine Laureshen, former engineering instructor and research consultant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She argued that current 
business structures don’t always support innovation, and although 
companies often have innovation strategies, the results are often the 
same or similar to their competitors. In part, that’s because company 
shareholders want their dividends, and the company needs predictable 
returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, Laureshen talked about a sense of control being lost. “Our agenda has been taken over by a <b>social license</b>
 to operate. Other people are making decisions for us.” In response, she
 said innovators in the oil industry need to get their message out: to 
let people know about the innovative work they are pursuing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Community and <b>social license</b></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loss-of-control theme
 came up earlier, before the panel began, when engineer and SPE 
president Darcy Brady touched on the concept of community during a 
keynote address to the audience. The question of exactly who represents 
the “community’ today is a broad one and he suggested engineers “have 
left the community behind in Alberta.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are the landowners, 
the neighbours and the stakeholders, but the indirect people have taken 
control,” he said, describing these as people from academia, interest 
groups, and professional protesters. “These are wonderful people to have
 in the mix,” he said. “We must be kept honest, but they shouldn’t 
control what we do in our industry, and it’s ours to win back….We have 
to be better as engineers, from the grassroots up.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The often-discussed <b>social license</b> is part of the problem, since “we have seemed to let people from somewhere else… give us what they call our <b>social license</b>,
 and they seem to want 100 per cent agreement or else hear everything, 
until the last objection is heard.” In response to that trend, he called
 on SPE members to move back to a place where it’s possible to get 
community consensus, where the vast majority of nearby people have a say
 in the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Give service firms a break</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although somewhat removed
 from community issues, Brady also called on SPE members to take a 
closer look at their working relationships with Western Canada’s 
oilfield service firms. It’s no secret in the industry that some service
 companies have been pressed repeatedly to drop their rates, and many 
have complied, to avoid losing work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The issue we have to 
face [now] is that we have skinned the service companies a little 
heavily and I think there’s going to be a little whiplash — we’re 
reading about it in the papers lately, and I think our service and 
drilling costs are going to go up. We’ve got to put some food back on 
their table, because we were maybe a little tight.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As nice as this [current
 crude oil] price is, I think we’re going to have put a little bit back 
into the service industry,” he said.</p>

 operators have largely reserved judgment on President Donald Trump's 
mandate that more oil and pipeline work involve domestic steel, but the 
oil and <b>gas</b> transportation industry is confident that the move will not affect safety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In announcing the 
memorandum, Trump said using U.S.-sourced pipe would translate to "a 
level of quality that you're not going to see when they bring the pipe 
from far distances." However, all pipe material must meet the same 
federal standards, regardless of origin, so a domestic steel requirement
 would be unlikely to change the quality of the pipe put into service, 
said John Stoody, vice president for government and public relations at 
the Association of Oil Pipe Lines, or AOPL.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither the AOPL nor the <span class="companylink">Interstate Natural <b>Gas</b> Association of America</span>
 has historically tracked the origin of pipeline materials, so neither 
organization was able to address the relative miles of domestic versus 
foreign steel being used. But representatives of both groups said they 
are looking into the issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With President Trump's 
memorandum, we are sampling such information from our members and hope 
to contribute to the discussion during the Department of Commerce's 
development of their plan over the next six months," Stoody said in a 
Feb. 3 email. "We'll be looking at issues such as domestic mill 
production capacity, product availability, competitive pricing, lag time
 in meeting orders and ability to warranty work. All of these issues 
contribute to the decision on where to source pipe and may provide 
insight into how to increase domestic steel and pipe usage."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless of the material origin requirements, pipe operators will keep pushing forward on planned repair work, INGAA noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't believe [the 
memorandum's proposal] would slow repairs. A safe and reliable pipeline 
network is priority one for pipeline operators. It's their <b>social license</b> to operate," INGAA spokeswoman Cathy Landry said Feb. 6. "So whatever the price is, they are going to pay it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president's 
memorandum gave the secretary of commerce half a year to make a plan for
 operators to use only domestic steel in new-build oil and <b>gas</b> pipe and repair work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the <span class="companylink">American Iron and Steel Institute</span>,
 the U.S. imported roughly 33 million net tons of steel in 2016, 
including nearly 1.4 million net tons of line pipe, which is used for 
oil and <b>gas</b> pipelines, along with some other kinds of pipe work. 
Finished steel imports had an estimated 26% of the nation's market share
 for 2016, the institute said recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. is the world's 
largest steel importer, buying the material from more than 90 countries 
and territories, and North America accounted for only 7% of steel 
production in 2015, according to the <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With an abundance of aging infrastructure and the ongoing shale boom, pipe is being replaced and added constantly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For <b>gas</b> transmission pipe alone, the Interstate Natural <b>Gas</b> Association of America Foundation has estimated the industry will need $2.2 billion to $3.6 billion in new interstate <b>gas</b> pipeline investment every year through 2035.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steel made up roughly 25% of the nation's oil, <b>gas</b> transmission, <b>gas</b> distribution and known <b>gas</b> gathering pipelines as of 2015, according to the <span class="companylink">U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Requiring these 
industries to use domestic-only steel would "expand markets" and help 
U.S. steelmakers ensure that their industry "remains highly productive 
and internationally competitive," Thomas Gibson, the American Iron and 
Steel Institute president and CEO, said at the end of January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">American Iron and Steel Institute</span>
 said there is adequate capacity for domestic steel producers to step up
 to fill increased demand, noting that, in recent months facilities were
 operating at roughly 75% of capacity nationwide.</p>

<span class="companylink">Questerre Energy Corporation</span> updated 
the resource assessment of its Utica acreage in the St. Lawrence 
Lowlands, Quebec where the best estimate by the company's independent 
reserve engineers of unrisked prospective resources net to Questerre is 
5.8 tcf (965 million boe).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This represents a 30 per cent increase over the 2010 year-end assessment by <span class="companylink">Netherland, Sewell &amp; Associates, Inc</span>.
 with a best estimate of unrisked prospective resources of 4.4 tcf (738 
million boe) net to Questerre. Additionally, the resource assessment 
details the best estimate of unrisked contingent resources net to 
Questerre is 898 bcf (150 million boe). Contingent resources were not 
assigned in 2010 due to the high uncertainty of economic potential at 
that time.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"After the new legislation was passed in December, we updated the resource assessment for our natural <b>gas</b>
 discovery in the Quebec Utica. The equivalent Ohio Utica in the United 
States has seen astonishing success using new technology,” said Michael 
Binnion, president and chief executive officer of Questerre. “Resources 
on our acreage have now only been assigned to the Upper Utica interval 
which is producing in Ohio and Pennsylvania, compared to the entire 
Utica interval in our previous assessment. Most importantly, the 
assessment supports that with the new technology, our discovery has 
strong economic potential. We are currently assessing low population 
density regions in Quebec that are most suitable for a pilot."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The updated resource 
assessment assigned economic contingent resources for approximately 16 
per cent of Questerre's acreage based on the test results from the 
company's Utica wells. The test results from these wells were reported 
by Questerre in 2008 to 2010. The chance of commercial development for 
these economic contingent resources was based on population density, 
ability to secure local acceptability to operate, the ability to apply 
new technology to environmental issues and other factors. As a result, 
our acreage has been high-graded by individual regional county 
municipality (RCM) with chance of commercial development ranging from 10
 per cent to 70 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Binnion added: "In the 
resource assessment, only two out of over thirty RCMs in the St. 
Lawrence Lowlands are being considered for pilot projects based on the 
factors above. These two RCMs, Lotbiniere and Becancour, have 
demonstrated well results within areas of very low population density. 
Our acreage in these two RCMs covers 253,000 acres.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Of this area, only 
36,000 acres or five per cent of our total acreage is currently being 
evaluated for possible future development and has been assigned 
contingent resource in the development on hold category. The net present
 value of this limited development area, covering 36,000 acres, 
discounted at 10 per cent before tax and risked with a 70 per cent 
chance of development is estimated at $311 million."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resource assessment was conducted by <span class="companylink">GLJ Petroleum Consultants</span>
 with an effective date of Dec. 31, 2016. It includes an economic 
assessment of contingent resources based on GLJ's price forecast as of 
the same date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price forecast can be
 found online at: 
https://www.gljpc.com/historical-forecasts[https://www.gljpc.com/historical-forecasts].
 It forecasts a <span class="companylink">NYMEX</span> Henry Hub price 
of US$3.60 per mmBtu in 2020 increasing to US$4.48 per mmBtu in 2026 and
 increasing at two per cent per annum thereafter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It assesses the Utica Shale <b>gas</b>
 potential within the company's 735,910 gross acres in the St. Lawrence 
Lowlands of Quebec. The resource assessment was prepared in accordance 
with National Instrument 51-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Oil and <b>Gas</b> Activities of the Canadian Securities Administrators (NI 51-101) and the Canadian Oil and <b>Gas</b> Evaluation Handbook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GLJ estimated petroleum 
initially in-place (PIIP), both discovered and undiscovered, as well as 
recoverable contingent and prospective resources over Questerre's 
acreage. The evaluation consisted of the Upper Utica which includes the 
Indian Castle and Dolgeville members as well as the Flat Creek. The Flat
 Creek, the lower most member was only evaluated to estimate 
undiscovered petroleum initially-in-place (UPIIP). No recoverable 
resources were assigned given the lack of test data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resource assessment 
is based on the results from several vertical and horizontal wells on 
the company's acreage that have all encountered pay in the Utica. Test 
data from these wells in conjunction with offset development and studies
 of the analogous U.S. Utica supports the prospective commercial 
development of these resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resource 
volumes have been classified as 'development on hold' or 'development 
unclarified.' Those areas classified as development on hold, including 
Lotbiniere and Becancour, are primarily contingent on the passage of 
applicable hydrocarbon and environmental legislation and regulations as 
well as local acceptability. Remaining areas classified as development 
unclarified have additional contingency or risk associated with securing
 <b>social license</b> to operate and are thereby a lower priority for 
development. Additional contingencies include firm development plans, 
detailed cost estimates and corporate approvals and sanctioning. There 
is no certainty that any portion of the contingent resources will be 
economic to develop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though pilot horizontal 
development plans have been proposed, the project evaluation scenario 
for the contingent resources is not sufficiently defined to make an 
investment decision to proceed to development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The contingent resources 
have been risked for the chance of commerciality, or commercial 
development, defined as the product of the chance of discovery and the 
chance of development. For contingent resources, the chance of discovery
 is equal to one. The chance of development is the estimated probability
 that once discovered, a known accumulation will be commercially 
developed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The contingent resources 
have established technology status. The development utilizes multistage 
hydraulic fracturing recovery technologies that are widely used in the 
development of shale <b>gas</b> plays including the Montney in Canada and the Utica formation in Ohio.</p>

 Nation is helping shape a new approach to environmental assessments in 
British Columbia, one that has won over at least one company attempting 
to build a major facility, Justine Hunter writes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Squamish Nation has 
kept the same law firm on retainer for more than 50 years, helping 
assert its rights and title in its traditional territories, which span 
from parts of Vancouver to north of Howe Sound.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a proposal for a liquefied natural <b>gas</b>
 plant and shipping terminal landed on Chief Ian Campbell's desk in May,
 2013, the option to fight the development in court could have been an 
easy choice. The First Nations community had significant concerns about 
the potential impact on marine life in a region that is just starting to
 recover from a century of industrial development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project could have faced legal roadblocks, but the Squamish Nation chose a different path.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a province divided 
between those who say “yes" to resource development and those who say 
“no," the Squamish said “maybe." They created their own environmental 
assessment process to decide for themselves if this project should earn 
their consent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.C. Premier Christy 
Clark touched down in a helicopter at a long-abandoned industrial site 
near the community of Squamish on a crisp November morning in 2016 to 
announce a milestone in her liquefied natural <b>gas</b> strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Standing next to 
overgrown railway tracks, the Premier wore a broad smile below her 
signature hardhat as officials from Woodfibre LNG declared their intent 
to invest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are just delighted today to be able to say that LNG in British Columbia is finally becoming a reality," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief Campbell was absent
 from the podium that day. He resisted the Clark government's appeals to
 attend – not because he is opposed, but because his council is not 
ready to endorse the $1.6-billion proposal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Squamish Nation is 
close to giving consent to the project, which is to be built on its 
traditional lands. Residents of Squamish – indigenous and non-indigenous
 alike – are deeply divided over the plan, and Woodfibre LNG and its 
partners are working hard to win an agreement with the First Nation that
 will deliver both economic certainty and an unwritten but important <b>social license</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notwithstanding the 
Premier's remarks, the project is not a reality yet. If Woodfibre LNG is
 built, it will be because the Squamish Nation decided to seek a path to
 “yes" that satisfied its concerns. The model that has emerged – the 
Squamish Nation Assessment Process – is helping shape a new approach to 
environmental assessments in British Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Woodfibre LNG proposes a 
production, storage and marine transfer facility at the mouth of the 
Squamish River on a former village site called Swiyat. It is in the 
heart of Squamish Nation territory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The facility would produce 2.1 million tonnes of LNG a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because it will run on electricity, its carbon footprint would be relatively modest compared with other proposed LNG projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clean Energy Canada, a 
climate and clean-energy think tank, estimates the 142,000 tonnes of 
carbon pollution annually would be equivalent to adding 36,000 cars to 
B.C. roads each year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site was once home to
 the Woodfibre pulp mill, which shut down in 2006. The closing 
eliminated 300 jobs, evaporated about one tenth of the district's tax 
base, and ended Squamish's status as a forestry resource town while 
propelling the area to a more diversified and less industrial economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It changed the dynamic 
in the community in a profound way," Squamish Mayor Patricia Heintzman 
said. “We're not the company town any more, we are getting to be a very 
diverse, stable economy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Heintzman opposes the
 LNG project, and Squamish council voted against it by a narrow margin. 
“There are other places in the province that are struggling and we are 
bursting at the seams," she said. “We seem to have opportunity abounding
 right now. We're a small city of 20,000 people, it's a lot for one 
small town to adjust to."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The district has no 
authority to stop the project, which already has federal and provincial 
environmental certificates. “We have all the impact, but none of the 
decision-making power," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenge</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Squamish Nation does 
have clout. The community was inclined to fight the project, based on a 
long struggle to assert its rights and title in the face of a century of
 industrial development in its traditional territories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief Campbell, who is the political spokesman for the Squamish Nation, said his community was especially frustrated by the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> oil pipeline project, which the federal and B.C. governments approved despite strong opposition from coastal First Nations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Squamish Nation vowed the Woodfibre LNG project would not be built without its consent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with many residents of the region, members of the Squamish Nation were troubled by the potential environmental impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also had concerns about the project's cumulative effects on their culture and their aboriginal rights and title.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concept of indigenous
 consent is not clearly defined in Canadian law, although the federal 
government has pledged to meet an international standard that requires 
“free, prior and informed consent" from indigenous communities on major 
projects in their territories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“First Nations wield 
significant leverage in these projects. We have options, whether it is 
through treaty, negotiations, litigation or civil disobedience – or we 
could do nothing," Chief Campbell said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We chose negotiation as a
 preferred path to try to reconcile the province's desire to issue 
rights to third-party interests on top of our rights and title."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Squamish solution</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aaron Bruce is the author of the Squamish Nation's environmental assessment process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A partner in the law firm
 Ratcliff &amp; Co., which has represented the Squamish Nation since 
1965, Mr. Bruce is the firm's first lawyer who is a member of the 
Squamish Nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his years of practice,
 he concluded that the Crown's environmental assessment process worked 
against First Nations. The LNG proposal prompted him to act on that 
conclusion. “I thought, we can develop our own."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he had to persuade his community it could be done – and would be more productive than simply fighting the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next step was to ask 
the proponents to be part of a legally binding agreement. “We said: ‘You
 can participate in it or we are going to fight you.' " The Squamish 
Nation and Woodfibre signed an agreement in 2014 that allowed the 
indigenous community to conduct its own review. It is a confidential 
process that uses material from the Crown reviews to avoid duplication, 
but adds considerations such as traditional uses of the land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year later, the review was complete and the company was presented with 25 conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two days later, it agreed to be legally bound by the conditions and is working on design changes to satisfy them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one instance, the Squamish questioned the plan to use seawater for cooling in the facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Woodfibre conducted additional studies about the potential impact on marine life agreed to switch to air-cooling technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bruce has been 
inundated with requests to explain the process to industry, government 
and other First Nations. “For me, this is about First Nations consent, 
and that it is not a scary thing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Byng Giraud, head of 
corporate affairs for Woodfibre LNG, said his company took a leap of 
faith to enter into the environmental assessment with the Squamish 
Nation – and he has no regrets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was new, it was a 
risk for both of us," he said. “Other businesses are scared of this. But
 this is the way things are going – you have to be more progressive."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The future</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.C. Environment Minister
 Mary Polak said the Squamish experience is helping bring reform to her 
government's environmental assessment process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her goal is not to have a
 separate process, as the Squamish have established, but one that brings
 First Nations into the Crown's process in a way that satisfies 
indigenous communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government was not ready to embrace the concept until it saw how it could work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For industry and even 
agencies of government, there is nervousness about bringing First 
Nations into the process. But our experience proves it is a huge 
positive," Ms. Polak said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I do think the key is to
 stop treating First Nations as stakeholders, and bring them into that 
process of decision-making," she said. Industry gains certainty because 
Crown and First Nations would be involved, while the indigenous 
communities gain confidence in the system because they would be a part 
of it. “You end up with a better project."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless the Squamish 
Nation issues its own environmental certificate – and finalizes an 
impactbenefits agreement that could exceed more than $100-million worth 
of jobs, land and cash – the project is not a done deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a province where First
 Nations have used their clout to delay projects – sometimes past the 
point of economic viability – the Squamish have forged a path forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is a new and innovative way of thinking," Chief Campbell said, “and an approach to getting to ‘yes.' "</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Gareau of The 
Interior News and Daryl Vandenberg of Moose FM spoke at length with 
Skeena-Bulkley Valley MP Nathan Cullen Dec. 21 on what happened in 2016,
 and what he sees in store for 2017.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daryl Vandenberg (DV): What sticks out to you as the highlight of 2016, with Smithers in mind?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nathan Cullen (NC): With 
Smithers in mind — The infrastructure money was important to get. When 
the government starts counting the numbers, just regionally and for 
British Columbia, we in the last round got about I think 16 per cent or 
so of the funding for B.C. just into the Northwest, which might mean 
much for people but we only have about two per cent of the population. 
So that feels good that our communities are able to crank up the volume.
 I mean Hazelton's arena was really important for me. I know it's not 
Smithers but it's certainly in the catchment and people here understand 
what kind of a hard time that community has been going through. So 
that's a real vote of confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"... the fact that we're 
not going to have to talk about Enbridge Northern Gateway in 2017 is 
really good; just to have that conflict, that threat, put to bed 
finally."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps again a little 
more regional than you're thinking, but the fact that we're not going to
 have to talk about Enbridge Northern Gateway in 2017 is really good; 
just to have that conflict, that threat, put to bed finally. Many people
 thought it was probably dead anyways, but it wasn't quite. So now that 
that's been — as they say in the language — set aside, that's good. It's
 good so we can focus on other things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV : Do you think that's 
kind of a shot at how the regulatory process is with how rights and 
title is looked at federally, or even with the provincial government or 
any government, and how they work with unceded territories? Maybe they 
got that wrong because it got shot down in the courts so maybe that's 
why they didn't choose this route and they chose the other two south?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"... simply firing up the
 bulldozer and doing whatever that you wanted isn't good enough, and 
that there's enough law and public pressure in place now that you have 
to bring in local communities and local First Nations. Rights and title 
are real, and they have to be addressed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: It's probably a lot 
of things coming together but let's put it this way: I was with an LNG 
company just last week in Ottawa and they acknowledge and understand the
 different world that we live in; that simply firing up the bulldozer 
and doing whatever that you wanted isn't good enough, and that there's 
enough law and public pressure in place now that you have to bring in 
local communities and local First Nations. Rights and title are real, 
and they have to be addressed. I mean even south of the border, Standing
 Rock and the protests that we've seen up here, if there's a way to work
 together and get along, it's better than not. And so, Northern Gateway,
 I still contend that economically, environmentally, just for us as a 
country, the project doesn't make any sense — never did. So yeah, the 
shift is on. And I think both sides, First Nations and companies, are 
still working out what that new dynamic's going to look like on a normal
 basis, right? It's very re-inventing the wheel every time almost right 
now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Gareau (CG): I 
guess connected to that, there were oil pipelines approved, there were 
LNG projects approved, there's an announcement coming in April — 
coincidently — about Petronas. When we're talking about Native rights 
and title and working together, it seems like there — and I've asked you
 about this before —</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Unist'ot'en.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: There are impasses in
 places. The Premier said 'we'll figure out a way,' but there won't be a
 way with some of them. It's 'no means no, no matter what.' What do we 
do in those situations, as a country, as a province, as a community?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So even from within First Nations communities, folks will say 'who speaks for us?'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: I think the first 
thing, it doesn't necessarily help out projects that are in the pipe 
right now, is that you confirm and establish in law what to consult and 
accommodate means. We still haven't, right? And the government has 
avoided ever coming up with a definition or a step on, step two type 
guide for no good reason; and it creates a lot of uncertainty, right? So
 even from within First Nations communities, folks will say 'who speaks 
for us?' And how much is it Band council, how much is it hereditary 
system? Because ... just if you take this region alone, never mind the 
rest of the country or province, but if I take you through the different
 communities, the different nations, how strong and vital the hereditary
 system is varies greatly. How strong the elected leadership is varies a
 lot. And who has credibility to make decisions is different village to 
village, nation to nation. So for the companies, that's just a confusing
 minefield of who do I deal with, who do I need a yes from, who has the 
power — and they got to figure it out every time. It's part of the 
reason we try to do that work, if you remember back when we tried to put
 a <b>social license</b> guide together for the region, First Nations 
was certainly a component of it — of the sort of five key elements that 
we described to companies, based on what we heard from communities: this
 is what you need to do in order to get our support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"And you'll even hear First Nations leaders say 'we don't have a veto,' but they sort of act like they do."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To your specific 
question: if a nation establishes title and the people speaking have the
 right to speak for that land, for that group, and have said under no 
circumstances, etc., as soon as it's established in court it becomes 
very difficult for a company or government to push through that. This 
debate going on, I'm sure you've seen it Chris, what's a veto, is it not
 a veto, who has a veto, and that's another place the government has 
been really reluctant. And you'll even hear First Nations leaders say 
'we don't have a veto,' but they sort of act like they do. It's 
confusing and confusion's never good for investors. What I'd say, 
particular to what we're talking about, is that if the Wet'suwet'en as a
 nation confirm that either in these areas or in general no pipelines 
can pass, then that'll have to be proven and taken all the way through 
court, because that's a pretty big statement. And it may go that way — I
 don't get the sense broadly from the Wet'suwet'en that that's the 
policy right now for the nation, but certainly within the Unist'ot'en 
they feel strongly that way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: My understanding from
 the Wet'suwet'en is because of their system, the hereditary chief in 
charge of that particular house gets to make the decision, and whether 
the other chiefs are for or against the project, they have to support 
that house because they're in control of that house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Yeah, and I think 
that's — I mean I'm not going to claim to be an expert on Wet'suwet'en 
inner politics — I think that's true and it's also true that the nation 
has a lot of conversations between the houses, for sure. That if a house
 is continuously left out on its own, the strength of the entire nation 
can be weakened over time. And I'm not saying that's what's happening, 
I'm just saying that both things are true: that the nation tries to act 
together, and out of respect — because it's all neighbours. So if the 
reverse were true, if you had a house that was just allowing all sorts 
of development in that was impacting downriver families and communities,
 it wouldn't be enough to just say 'well, they've said yes to that 
really bad mining project, so that just means yes.' That's not how the 
Wet'suwet'en work from my — because that's not how the environment 
works. You know what I'm saying?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: It has to factor in the whole ecosystem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Sure. So when you get
 into something like a pipeline, or anything that has impact across a 
boundary, the conversations between the houses are what happens ... And 
I've watched it happen. I've watched people get into disputes and I've 
watched them resolve them. That's why you really want a healthy 
governance on the First Nations side, so they can handle tough 
questions. And there's not a lot of uncertainty as to who the 
spokespeople are, whether the community has the right information or not
 — you want all of that. And I think there used to be — and there is 
still is for some — folks ...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Pause in interview due to Interior News editor's pen dying.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: What the Unist'ot'en 
in particular — I haven't raised it with any of the companies whether 
routing options are possible. That's a choice that a proponent makes, 
right? They decide do we press ahead as it is; can we make some 
accommodation and still get it passed, or are we facing an immovable 
political force that won't step aside, and do we have to go around or 
what else can we do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: Well, it seems like we're going to get a test of it if LNG ever comes to pass because <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> says 'we're going to try to go around,' <span class="companylink">Chevron</span> says 'we're going to go right through.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: That's a good test, right?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: So, my question is, 
these people are going to go to the extreme to try to stop it, I guess, 
can anything get done until we figure that out? And how do we get things
 done?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Well, things do get done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: But then there's court challenges now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At some point you hit a point in the spectrum where authority is no longer enough to say yay or nay on something."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Yeah, for sure, but I
 think my sense in talking to the courts is that the more these — take, 
Enbridge was sitting under — it lost an appeal, right, that the 
government had done a bad consultation job and said the Province was not
 allowed to just pass off their duties to the feds. All those things get
 settled out. Now you've got some juris prudence; you have some history 
on those questions. We're answering question by question by question. 
Because one of the things we've asked the government to decide on is at 
what level of First Nations governance is the authority resting at. Does
 it have to sit at the national, whole nation level? Is it the house 
group? Is it down to an individual family group? Is it down to an 
individual? At some point you hit a point in the spectrum where 
authority is no longer enough to say yay or nay on something.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: But how do you who is the hereditary chief? Like in the Gitxsan?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Well, in most places you know. In the Northwest, there's sometimes for sure — like the Gitxsan are complicated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: There's like 60.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: 64. And then there's 
wing chiefs. Sometimes there can be dispute over a name, for sure. That 
can arise, but it's really in the nation's interest to sort those things
 out because there may be projects that generally the nation does't 
want, but there's going to be projects that the nation definitely wants.
 And if there's a bunch of confusion as to who the spokespeople are, 
that hurts the nation. So there's a big incentive to sort those things 
out within their traditional practice. It happens all the time. There's 
some in the United States right now that would say, 'Hillary won by 3 
million votes, this is crazy. How is he the president?' So there's a 
dispute. It's not the same thing, but even in European electoral 
politics we see —</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: Who people believe is the leader —</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Your system has to be
 seen as legitimate. Whatever system you use within a nation. And I you 
look around the Northwest, the most successful nations almost always 
have the most coherent political system. The ones that are able to not 
fight about that part of it, are able to fight about the stuff that 
advances their interests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: They're not divided.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is of the federal 
government's interest, if they're interested in resource development, to
 improve the internal capacity of First Nations, with respect to 
politics and governance."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: So back to your 
question: We've said this to the feds for years. It is of the federal 
government's interest, if they're interested in resource development, to
 improve the internal capacity of First Nations, with respect to 
politics and governance. It really is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: It is, except in the 
northwest of B.C. alone, it's incredibly complicated. To bring that onto
 a national scale — of course other provinces are different, they have a
 more set Band system — seems like an impossible job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Maybe, but it's not a quick job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: And that brings me back to how can we get stuff done in the meantime?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Yeah, and I think in 
the meantime what we're seeing — OK so say if you go back just the 12 
years since I've been elected, I've watched a whole bunch of the nations
 in the Northwest set up independent economic arms for their nation. 
Because 10-15 years ago, almost all the nations with one or two 
exceptions, all those economic decisions were happening at the chief and
 council table, which is a difficult mix because you've got all the 
politics, now you're talking about business. It's almost set up to fail.
 So one advancement has been that all of these companies, when they sign
 impact agreements, are doing it with a professional business arm of the
 First Nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: Except that brings us
 to the Gitxsan again. People are saying Gitxsan Treaty Society, Gitxsan
 Development Corporation, Gitxsan Government Commission, aren't 
legitimate, and they're — and in Kitwanga (Gitwangak), hereditary chiefs
 brought them an eviction notice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Yes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: I mean, it doesn't seem like these economic organizations are helping, so what can we do in the meantime?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Well again, in places
 where the politics or the governance is more accepted and understood — 
the development arm isn't the fix, it is just simply a tool. But it has 
to rest upon strong internal governance. And the Gitxsan have had —</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: Is it transparency maybe, because leaked documents and people not showing the audits to the public, apparently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: And that's always 
been my position, is that the First Nations have to have audited books 
and those audited books have to be displayed to the members of that 
community. That's who they're accountable to, full stop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't want to make any 
excuses but there are times when you're — as I was dealing with one 
First Nations leader he said, 'Well, you know, I just buried' — he's in 
his maybe 40s — 'I just buried my fourth sibling. We have internal 
social challenges that make day-to-day stuff that you think is obvious, 
challenging.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Connection to land, 
authority to make decisions, good strong governance: these are the 
principals of successful communities anywhere in the world. That's a 
fact."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's difficult. And he 
wasn't making excuses either; he was just opening me up to his life, 
which is tough. He's been through addictions; and he's together. He's 
got his stuff moving and he's somebody I rely on, and he is challenged 
every single day in ways that I am not. Fact, when I go into the House 
of Commons, I am not facing the same social strife that he is at all. 
And we know this, right? It's not an excuse, it's just an obvious 
reality that you have to address. And some people would say this is 
chicken and egg: if you had better economics, then a lot of that social 
strife goes away. And I say yes and no. I could take you to northern 
Alberta Bands that had lots of economic development flow through them 
and there's still similar problems. Connection to land, authority to 
make decisions, good strong governance: these are the principals of 
successful communities anywhere in the world. That's a fact. OK. So we 
haven't had that here for 200 years, we've had the opposite: I'm going 
to grind your culture down; we're going to take away your language; 
we're going to break your governance. And only in the last 20 or 30 
years, after Delgamuukw (1997 Supreme Court decision on Aboriginal 
title, brought forward by the Gitxsan and Wet'suwet'en) actually, 
mostly, did we start to say 'oh, you should rebuild your governance.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: Instead of making things at Band council, instead of drawing up treaties?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't think it's being done to divide and conquer, but that's the result."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: I mean, we're into 
some of the political philosophy, but the distinction that government 
makes between Band council authority and elder, hereditary authority is 
highly selective and often highly divisive from federal and provincial 
governments. I've watched it all the time. So if you're representing the
 hereditary system, and you're representing the elected system, and 
one's saying yes and one's saying no, the provincial government will 
come in and acknowledge and give authority to the one saying yes — and 
then flip. It's a divide and conquer strategy. I don't think it's being 
done to divide and conquer, but that's the result. And so a little 
consistency from the non-native side wouldn't hurt, because if you're 
sitting in one of those nations, it's like 'OK, on Tuesday the Premier 
said my elected chief and council get to make decisions on the land. And
 then the next Tuesday, said no, no, it's the head of such and such a 
house that now has the authority.' Because I'm getting the answer that I
 want.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: Yeah, a perfect 
example of that was when I spoke to the LNG Minister, that 'no, we're 
only dealing with elected Bands.' And then the documents come out that 
they signed with the hereditary chiefs of the Gitxsan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: That's right. Because why? Because he wasn't getting what he wanted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: From the Bands of the Gitxsan?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're not consistent, and they don't negotiate in good faith."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Right. So if you're 
negotiating with anybody — I used to be a negotiator, and one of the 
core principals you need across the table is good faith and consistency.
 There's been many times the provincial and federal governments have 
lacked either one or both of those things. They're not consistent, and 
they don't negotiate in good faith. Look, lots of responsibility on both
 sides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get back to your 
question: can things be done. Yes they can be done. I think it's a two 
track. You have to — we've pitched the feds a number of times on youth 
leadership initiatives; young native kids coming up in their teens and 
early 20s. Invest in these kids now, and while you won't see the payoff 
one year from now, the payoff comes 10, 20 and forever more after, if 
we're bringing these kids up, exposing them to leaders around the 
country. This is only hopeful because they'll bring that back home. And 
we need more of that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: That still goes 
around — you say yes, things can get done now, invest in kids and you'll
 see it in 10-20 years. What about the meantime?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: OK, so like I said, 
two tracks. In terms of — that's a medium, longterm track. The reason I 
want to raise it all the time is we never do it. Everybody always says, 
'oh yeah, we need to invest in the kids, and we ought to make sure the 
next generation coming up.' Well I'm 12 years in. I'm dealing with the 
generation, in some ways, were in high school when I started. I'm seeing
 them come in, and I'm saying did we do any of that yet? No we didn't. 
We're still waiting. So we need to do both. We can walk and chew gum, 
same time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In terms of the now, 
every company that meets with me and will raise a question like 
Unist'ot'en, what I try to do is facilitate and say, 'here are the 
options as I see them. I don't know your industry. I don't claim to be a
 mining expert, or an LNG. So, you'll make your decisions, but you need 
to go in and start conversations early and make your decisions early 
based on this.' But ignoring people, or only doing what the Province is 
doing, which is 'we're only going to talk to chief and councils,' is a 
way to almost guarantee conflict. Because what you're saying is we just 
don't respect you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: It's technically illegal in a way?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: It's not illegal, but
 it's likely challengeable in court, right? You're opening yourself up 
to lawsuits, as Enbridge did and as the Province did on Northern 
Gateway. They set themselves up for a lawsuit when Victoria wouldn't 
consult with First Nations. Well, the duty to consult is going to be 
challenged in court, and they lost. Trudeau had that decision on Gateway
 to appeal it, which would have been the next step.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: So looking back over 
the year, we haven't really made any progress on that file? On that 
whole what you're talking about: trying to make things clear; figuring 
out how they can work together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: From the federal 
side, this is the first year of the Trudeau government, with lots of big
 promises — particularly towards First Nations. He's going to do all the
 truth and reconciliation recommendations; he was going to end boil 
water advisories. Some things have been done, like the launching of the 
murdered and missing women inquiry, which is important. On some of the 
moment to moment things, I think there's a sense of confusion or even 
betrayal: on Site C, on the promise to make credible the environmental 
assessment again, which Trudeau said he would do before he approved 
Kinder Morgan, which he lied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: That's connected to the same issue in a way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As soon as this process 
is shown as flawed and people lose confidence in the process, then they 
seek to throw the process out, which is normal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Sure it is, because 
you expose yourself to lawsuits and conflict. You guys have been in a 
courtroom. The moment the room feels like the judge is biased and 
exposes a bias, the lawyer losing will seek a mistrial, right? As soon 
as this process is shown as flawed and people lose confidence in the 
process, then they seek to throw the process out, which is normal. The 
reason Trudeau made that commitment — it was a correct commitment — was 
that Harper had so gutted the process, the way we do things, that it 
lost credibility with large parts of the public. I mean people up north 
here who went through the Enbridge hearings would just get confused, 
like this is so — you can't get answers; this is not a real inquiry into
 this question, and these questions matter. And then it got worse for 
Kinder Morgan. The process for Kinder Morgan is you can't ask the 
company questions. Like they present evidence: This is our cleanup plan 
or this is what jobs will be created. And you can't question the 
evidence; it just gets submitted and the NEB just takes it as fact. 
There is no cross examine mode under the environmental review right now.
 Which is just weird. It's just a bad process because you want to attest
 evidence. Because they could say we're going to make a million jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: You say there's no cross examination, and I don't want to get too much into Kinder Morgan because it's down there, but —</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Cross file.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: — to compare it to 
the LNG project that was approved, you can, yes, cross file. That's a 
perfect example. They put in their evidence, the company hires 
scientists to put in their —</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: And then you hire other scientists and they try to debunk it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: And they try to 
debunk it. And then I guess the professionals, or — I don't know 
actually who in the federal government looks at all this stuff. Are 
these scientists?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Sometimes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: Or are they 
bureaucrats that are in the government going, 'OK, I got this from these
 scientists, I got this from these scientists, this is what it kind of 
actually is?'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"... it's shown for what it is, which is the worst science and maybe the worst fishermen in the history of humankind, right?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: It's not transparent 
as to actually how they weigh it out. And that's — I know it sounds like
 a splitting hairs thing — but the reason open hearing where the 
evidence is challenged, is that the company defends it, the opponents 
attack it, you can see — and the NEB is showing you — what their 
wrestling with and what they're likely going to — and they also ask 
questions, right? That's how the process usually goes. When you just 
submit, submit, and then it goes into a dark corner and then an answer 
spits out at the end, you don't know actually what evidence won out. And
 I know we're talking a bit about — so a good example is Lelu Island, 
where the evidence was saying this is clearly harmful to fish. And the 
company submits evidence that says we couldn't find any fish. And you 
say well, what was the methodology? Well, they went out with a metre by 
metre net that had three-inch holes in it looking for salmon smolts. 
Well, you put that in open court or in open hearing, it's almost inane 
because it's shown for what it is, which is the worst science and maybe 
the worst fishermen in the history of humankind, right? Like, you were 
trying to catch fish that way? Well, boy oh boy, I hope you're not 
feeding your family; you'll never.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So I know it sounds like 
something small, yet when you want to have faith in the outcome. Similar
 to this — and we're deep down the environmental assessment line — the 
NEB will always come out with conditions. And the government and the 
company will say, 'well look, there are a lot of conditions here: 100 
conditions, 200 conditions.' The auditor general of Canada audited the 
NEB as to whether they follow through on their conditions on pipelines 
and found that it's just a little over 50 per cent of the conditions 
were ever monitored again. So these are ways that you undermine your own
 credibility, is the thing that you hold up to say, 'have confidence in 
us,' you don't actually do; and that the evidence that you actually make
 your decision on is never properly challenged. You know, it's like 
again back to the courtroom because that's the analogy that works for 
me. So the evidence is submitted, you don't know how the judge 
determines her decision, she spits out a decision and then puts out a 
bunch of conditions on the person being accused, but those conditions 
are never followed up on. And you see it time after time, like wait a 
second, this is a bad courtroom. I have no confidence in this. I want a 
different judge. So getting the judge right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyways, we're down a bit
 of a thing. In terms of getting things done here, and I told this to an
 LNG company here last week — and they agreed, by the way — I said, if 
you get a decision from the regulator, you have to go beyond that 
decision in convincing the public that your project is good and safe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: Helps your cause further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: It's required. The 
stamp from the government — boonk, here are the conditions, here's our 
approval — does not win over enough of the public for you to have <b>social license</b>; for you to have enough community support to not run into conflict.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: Is <b>social license</b> a thing that people who disagree with government decisions something that they use just to fight approval?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I see companies say we have <b>social license</b>, never define it. And I see opponents say they don't have <b>social license</b>, and don't define it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: I see it used by both sides. I see companies say we have <b>social license</b>, never define it. And I see opponents say they don't have <b>social license</b>, and don't define it. It is a nebulous term, that's why a lot of people don't like it, because it's not a —</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: Concrete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Yeah, it's just not a test that you can hold up and transparently say —</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: Like you're doing a survey or something.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: — yes or no.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: Isn't that done through elections?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: That is a form, I 
suppose. That Trudeau gaining the support of British Columbians, in some
 measure anyways, said when it comes to pipelines — pipelines were a big
 issue — I think it was something like two-thirds of all the votes that 
Harper lost in the last election compared to the election before were 
lost in British Columbia. Of any votes that Conservatives lost, 64 or 65
 per cent of them were lost here. It's an interesting thing. I don't 
know what it means, but anyways B.C. was a place where Conservatives 
went backwards. Where they stayed the same or even went up in other 
places in the country, yet they lost the election in large part to B.C. 
Trudeau got the most votes for a Liberal ever, certainly in 30 or 40 
years, out of British Columbia. They got a lot of MPs out of B.C. 
Pipelines were a big issue. The commitments on pipelines was pretty 
clear: no to Northern Gateway, a review of environmental assessment to 
make it credible in your eyes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To my mind, if you say is an election not a way of doing <b>social license</b>, it was an acknowledgement that the way things are right now has got the acceptance of people in the west coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: Like in the past year he hasn't done —</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: No, but going into 
the election, going through the election. The only reason you make a 
commitment is, I think, because you think it's the right thing and you 
think people will support you. There may be other reasons why people 
make election promises, but those are two pretty good reasons: You think
 it's good, and you think you'll win votes. Although, I was with a 
Liberal on TV, we were presenting our electoral reform report — the one 
that the Minister then slammed — and somebody said this is in your 
election platform; you promised to change the voting system. And then 
the chair of our committee said, look, election platforms are just ways 
to engage voters. And I was sitting beside him at the national press 
theatre in Ottawa, 20 reporters in the room, and I actually said, 
'really?' Like, I don't know if that's a Freudian slip or that's 
actually how Liberals think about election platforms. A cynic would say 
yeah. Like, you put your platform out, you're just saying things to get 
elected, but it's just an engagement tool; it's not a guide to what 
you'll do in government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: What you say is not what you mean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: That's super cynical.
 That describes the worst of what people think about politicians, which 
is just say anything, do anything, get elected, and then see you in four
 years. But he said it into the microphone, it's not me speculating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: And on the pipelines 
issue, you're saying that became a big issue in B.C. and that's why the 
Liberals did so well, and that might represent the <b>social license</b>?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: But then that <b>social license</b> is predicated on, is built on you actually following through. Not just as an engagement tool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: To prove to us that you have the <b>social license</b>, right? Not just to say, well then meet the recommendations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Hey look, we notice 
this in the North here, that when I would say to a voter — and we polled
 this, we did some town halls on this — and I'd say, 'here's the 
project, here's Northern Gateway. Here it is as it is, how many support 
or oppose?' There was 70 oppose 30 support, give or take. It'd go high 
60s, in that range. If I said, 'the project's now different. It does 
value added; there's an upgrader; there's a refinery here or anywhere 
else, doesn't matter, but the product we are moving is no longer 
bitumen.' The support almost flipped for two reasons, the people would 
tell us: One is the environmental risks are lower when you're not 
dealing with diluted bitumen; and the benefits side of the equation gets
 a lot better for Canada and maybe the region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've talked about this a
 hundred times. I think these things — and this goes for First Nations 
broadly — these are risk/benefit questions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: That brings me to a 
bigger question with the NDP. There is a large movement in your party, 
it's why you're picking a new leader, pretty much. That doesn't fly, 
this value-added. Oil is a bad word. It's keep it in the ground; it's 
the Leap Manifesto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"...someone in caucus 
just like last week brought up the Leap Manifesto, and that was the 
first time I'd heard of it raised in six months."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Yeah, you know that's
 funny, someone in caucus just like last week brought up the Leap 
Manifesto, and that was the first time I'd heard of it raised in six 
months. It's out there and for sure there's a constituency within the 
party that whatever's in that manifesto — even though parts of it are 
fundamentally and constitutionally incorrect. The Manifesto is paid for 
by, for example, resource revenues. The federal government doesn't 
control resource revenues, the provinces do, so who knows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: Depends which resources, but yeah most resources —</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We kill fish and trees and dig up rocks in this part of the world, and I will defend it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Well 95 per cent of 
the money we get out of resources in this country go to provincial 
coffers. So paying for a national program on X out of money you don't 
control would be an interesting trick. Regardless, there is a huge and 
strong constituency in our party that is about working people. It the 
working class party, that's where I come from philosophically. We kill 
fish and trees and dig up rocks in this part of the world, and I will 
defend it. I just want to defend it on terms that are most beneficial to
 the communities I represent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so where you find 
common ground, not just in Canadians but within New Democrats, is when 
you say, 'this is all raw export. This is a last gasp industry strategy,
 which is just move everything raw until it's done. You know, oh Lord, 
one more boom.' From a philosophy of a working people's party, you would
 say as principle, what you try to do with your natural resources is get
 as much value out of them as you can. And we have been running on fish 
on trees, on oil, on mining in the opposite direction for more than a 
generation now. And I think there was a similar backlash in the States 
with working class Americans not feeling, seeing the benefits of trade, 
for one example. There is an absolute palpable backlash existing here in
 Canada. By existing, I mean it's there, where a lot of working people 
are saying, 'wait, I don't understand. You want to go sign a trade deal 
with China now?' Government has a huge case to make why that would help 
middle class, working class people out, because they just haven't seen 
it. We've seen the meltdown in '08, and somehow the very people who 
perpetrated that got richer out of the process. Three of them went to 
jail and the rest of them did fine, and a lot of people lost homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: So are you against trade deals?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: No.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: And not necessarily with China, but were you for the CETA (<span class="companylink">European Union</span>) deal?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: No, just on 
sovereignty level. There's a couple of components: the dispute 
resolution, the investor state protection, which is you treat a company 
like a country, is problematic because you give them rights without 
responsibility. Like, we treat a country that can sue us for doing 
something like a country because they have rights but they also have 
responsibility: we can sue them back. There's state to state relations. 
But when you give <span class="companylink">Monsanto</span> or Bechtel 
the authority of a government, of a state, to sue but without any of the
 responsibilities that a state has — the responsibility is only to their
 shareholders, not to citizens — it's a massive giveaway that you just 
cannot do. It's really, really problematic longterm. And there's been 
elements of the European groups that have been trying to undo that 
element. There's just some pretty decent analysis that our 
pharmaceutical costs are going to go up quite a bit, and that it'll 
undermine some of our milk marketing, some of the basic ways we 
structure a few of our industries, which may become illegal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: Protectionist I think is what it's called.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: No, they're not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: The milk industry? Subsidized?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: No, it's not subsidized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: That's the wrong word maybe but you know what I mean. The prices should be lower is what a lot of people would say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Sure, it's a 
marketing board structure, as are eggs and whatnot. Well, you got two 
models that exist right now, anyways. The States does not have supply 
management, yet every taxpayer in the U.S. whether they ever drink a 
glass of milk in their life subsidizes the milk industry. We subsidize 
it through our pricing. It's actually, I would argue, more equitable. If
 you drink milk, you subsidize milk producers; if you don't drink milk, 
you don't. If you're lactose intolerant in the States, you still 
subsidize milk producers. You're welcome, right? One of the milk guys in
 the States was actually enlightening me on it — and Europeans do the 
same thing — they either have a supply management system on these basic 
commodities, or you have state subsidy. And the trade deals try to get 
rid of both. But Canada's experience on things like softwood is that we 
do the good boy scout thing, we undermine some of our own policies, but 
they don't on the other side stop theirs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: What do we got to do to secure a solid deal?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think we're in big 
trouble on softwood, actually, because Trump campaigned on either 
ripping up or fundamentally renegotiating big trade deals."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: On softwood? I have 
no idea. I think we're in big trouble on softwood, actually, because 
Trump campaigned on either ripping up or fundamentally renegotiating big
 trade deals. When I was in Washington, Republicans were telling me that
 this was the number one, first test is softwood. And they have a 
$2-billion slush fund for legal and everything else that they're — it 
was actually money we left on the table — anyway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: Does it mean that's 
something you're going to keep your eye on in the coming year, with your
 constituents, your Conservative friends over in the east? You guys were
 working on that earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Yeah, and there was a
 small window — and admittedly small — when Obama was still in, the race
 was still on. If there was any interest for us to push the new 
relationship, the bromance that was happening, if you wanted to put a 
marker down, settle softwood before the new congress came in. And the 
Trade Minister said, 'we're only in preliminary talks. We're not going 
to try to settle anything.' I'm going back now 11 months, and they said 
oh, it's a lame-duck congress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: In the summer they tried to do it, right? (MP) Zimmerman was pushing them to do something.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Yeah but summer, in 
the U.S. election cycle anyone would tell you that by the time you get 
into July, August, September, you're now 60 days, 50 days away from the 
election. Nobody's in D.C.; nobody's signing any deals; you're not 
getting anything through congress — congress isn't sitting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: So is it too late?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Oh for Obama?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: For any kind of positive deal for us. Is too late to make any kind of negotiation?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Now we have to deal with the new administration, which is I would say violently anti-softwood lumber agreement."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: This is all about 
percentages, right? Like, what are your chances of getting a great deal.
 They went from 50-50 with the last administration, say 11 months ago, 
January of 2016 let's just say to pick a spot — Trudeau's in, we have a 
Trade Minister, we're going to Washington. We weren't raising it. 
Trudeau sits with Obama at a state dinner, it doesn't get raised. That 
was the window.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now we have to deal with 
the new administration, which is I would say violently anti-softwood 
lumber agreement. And know this, the Canadians came in — and I thought 
this was bad strategy — saying we'll just take the old deal. And we 
signed the old deal, we said this is not a great deal ... the one that's
 been existing the last 6-7 years. We started there, which as you know 
in a negotiation your starting point is not usually where you end up. So
 we're going to downgrade from what we already said was not a great deal
 to a less great deal, to I don't know now what Trump means. That was 
even then imagining Hillary being in the White House.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: He's a great negotiator. The best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: He's the best negotiator. How dare you say great?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I worry about it, because
 here's the other difference — and this is important for people to get —
 is that you compare it to the last time we went in to this conflict, 
Canadian companies were Canadian companies almost exclusively. They've 
now —</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: They've bought a lot of mills —</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So large, now multi-national forestry companies can play a trade dispute against itself to their benefit. It's a big problem."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: They are both sides 
of the border. So large, now multi-national forestry companies can play a
 trade dispute against itself to their benefit. It's a big problem. 
Because obviously that was big forest sitting down and urging Canada to 
work hard and spend some capital, was the Canfors and the big companies 
on this side. I don't get any sense of urgency from them right now, and 
they're just expecting a 30 per cent hit across the board. They're just 
anticipating a 30 per cent loss in sales across the U.S. border.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: Not to mention AAC cuts too, right?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Yeah, combine that with some pine beetle issues that we're now really feeling the big hit on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: So looking ahead, how high of a priority is all of that combined?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: For the government, I can't tell. They haven't made it a priority yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: Or for you at least anyway?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's the sleeping giant that's just about to wake up and hit some communities that have been hit hard already."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Me, it's huge. It's 
the sleeping giant that's just about to wake up and hit some communities
 that have been hit hard already. I'm thinking of the Burns Lakes, the 
Terraces, the Smithers, Houston even, places that have either lost a 
mill or have taken a hit on the mills that they have. Looking at 
available fibre being a problem, and looking at a border that's about to
 thicken if not close — just getting really expensive, I should put it 
that way. That's a perfect storm. And especially if your majors now are 
not beating the drum, putting pressure on the politicians to settle, to 
get a good deal. If they're saying, 'well our Alabama operations or 
Mississippi mills, we have an insurance policy now.' It's fine for them,
 I'm not saying that was for their own self interest the wrong thing to 
do, but in terms of a Canadian perspective, it's taken a big interest 
not off the table, but lessened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: What else is a top priority moving into 2017 for the area?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think getting Petronas to move over will give me more confidence that some LNG can happen."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: For the area, similar
 to the country, our job growth numbers have been very anemic. We had a 
bit of a surge through '14, '15, '16, there was speculative LNG. I think
 getting Petronas to move over will give me more confidence that some 
LNG can happen. I think the LNG is going to go back on the burner. 
Prices have started to move and capital will be flowing back into these 
companies. Every company's different, but a lot of companies their 
cashflow is very much connected to the price of oil. I'm not sure where 
oil is today, but the expectations have changed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: It was inching up a little bit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Yeah, the Saudis and 
others have actually shown some determination to limit the supply. 
Anyways, it's oil stuff. The question is, do all the alternative oil 
fields come back online. Some of them are turnkey operations, some of 
them are not. Anyways, just in terms of LNG, some of those connected 
companies — the Shells of the world — rely on oil being north of $50, 
$60 before they start to put projects back off the shelf. If Petronas 
moves just a little bit — 400 yards or so — that'll show a certain 
amount of determination or understanding on their part to get something 
done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: Any chance to make that happen?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Yes. I mean, there's a
 lot of skeptics that say why would a company do this, and I'd say self 
interest. Why do companies ever do anything? It's self interest. This is
 the thing — I feel like I've said this to you guys — the thing I don't 
get financially, economically speaking, is the project as they've 
designed where they've designed it cost them an extra somewhere near 
$1.7 billion, for this extra train and trellis they've got to build out 
further past the Flora Banks ... I mean we throw these numbers around 
just casually, but imagine you're the manager trying to push this 
project and you gotta put this little budget line in. 'Oh, by the way, 
$1.7 billion for the bridge. Unless we move it a stone's throw away, 
then I can save us $2 billion, or some amount of money.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: You had mentioned 
this before but the manager would probably say, 'well we don't own that 
land.' That's the main problem, it's owned by other people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Yeah, but would other people be willing to give it up?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: For $1.7 billion maybe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: No, no.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: But they've got to sell it. And they've also got to say that if we're selling it, our LNG project's dead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Yeah, but there's 
been changes since. When people staked all those claims to where we are 
now, there's been dramatic changes. BG's been taken over for example. 
Other companies have just publicly said this is not a priority. All 
these changes in the environment should change your strategy. Bad 
strategy is when you just say, 'here's our plan. It doesn't matter if 
all the circumstances change, this is our plan.' Good strategy means pay
 attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: And they would have to go through the environmental review process again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Not entirely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: How so?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"... certainly common sense would say you don't have to review again the 95 per cent of the project."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: We're doing some 
research out of the library to say — well particularly if this 90 to 95 
per cent of the project is to here, and then the last five per cent 
change — certainly common sense would say you don't have to review again
 the 95 per cent of the project. And we're looking at CEAA (<span class="companylink">Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency</span>)
 right now to say what precedence do we have — I just have a document in
 from the Library of Parliament I received in my email this morning — of
 anybody essentially being advanced in the process with a change that is
 broadly recognized as positive for the environment, and we think 
there's some precedence to do that. There's some law, which is what this
 relies on, ultimately. Because you could see where a bad actor would 
get all the way through, get their papers; they do this in mining all 
the time, where if you only mine so much ore the intensity of your 
assessment — there's stages, right, of how big your assessment is — so 
they'll go in like one per cent below tipping into the next level of 
assessment. They get the paper, get approved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: Kind of like income and taxes?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Yeah, a little, you 
move up a stage. So they get approved and when the mine opens up they 
say, 'oh, we've found this other ore body. We're actually going to mine 
30 per cent.' Now they're way above that threshold but they've got 
papers. So that gets challenged all the time, actually unsuccessfully, 
which is interesting — people lose those challenges. We're into details 
today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: Yeah, I did not know about that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: The precedence on a 
company saying, by altering the project this way, we significantly 
diminish the environmental impact. We think there's precedence that CEAA
 would look at that and say, yeah there's some credit you get for doing 
that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: So that would pertain particularly to Lelu Island. It could, if you were to mosve it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Well the Flora Banks, in particular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: Because the dream is to move it to Ridley, I think is the main target?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Yeah. There's lots on
 Ridley; there's other lots that companies have. The further you get 
away, it starts to alter, like big alterations in the pipeline route. 
But I've been reading up on how you cross water, when LNG goes under 
water, what do you do. It's kind of interesting because the stuff's 
super cold. Once you've processed then liquified the <b>gas</b>, what 
they do is they double case the pipe, which is normal. So you've got 
your internal pipe and everything, and then you've got the secondary 
pipe. One engineer told me that if you ran an LNG pipe and it cracked 
underwater, which is the single casing, you'd freeze that section of 
ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: Yeah, it's cold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: It's super cold. It 
would draw so much heat out as it tried to come to temperature, you 
would solid freeze whatever section of ocean you were going under. And 
apparently it's happened. It's very rare that they move LNG underwater, 
they usually trelis overtop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: This could save the ice caps!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Because you burn <b>gas</b> — normally you burn <b>gas</b> to freeze the <b>gas</b>. That would be an amazingly expensive way to bring back the polar icecap, but yes, in theory, you could.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So is it possible? It's not easy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: Is this what the NDP are proposing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: I've been proposing it for more than a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: I'm kind of curious, you say you have the documents on you now to show that there's precedence, there's law, etc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: We're looking at it. 
We've got an early indication that yes. Library of Parliament research, 
they're very cautious about whenever saying this is the authority of 
Parliament, saying this is true. It's research they do for me, so then I
 have to stand behind it. It's a legal thing with the Library. You can't
 ever submit it and use it as a legal text, etc. They are PhDs that work
 for Mps in the Library. They help us out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: And they're helping you out, you have those documents. Who are you going to be showing those documents to?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But I would be showing 
them to interested parties like Lax Kw'alaams, to the company. This is 
something I committed to the company and the local First Nations, that I
 would do."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: I want to read 
through them first. But I would be showing them to interested parties 
like Lax Kw'alaams, to the company. This is something I committed to the
 company and the local First Nations, that I would do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: So it's information that furthers the argument that moving, or that a project could —</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: It's close to like 
seeing what's a legal opinion, right? Because some people say well you 
have to start CEAA right from the beginning. So I said, is that true? Is
 it true when you alter a small percentage of the project, is it true 
when you alter the project to known and obvious environmental benefit? 
Does the law to CEAA as it's written right now require that, and whose 
authority is it that can change that. Can the Minister issue — because 
we've seen this before, where the Minister can issue something. Harper 
used to do it in bad ways, where there'd be a Friday afternoon the 
Minister would issue something on the Canadian Gazette and boom, a whole
 bunch of law just got undermined, and if it was too much it would get 
challenged. This would be interesting if someone would want to challenge
 it because — maybe someone would, who knows. That's not my world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: You're showing Lax Kw'alaams and you're showing the company, are you showing the federal Minister as well?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Why would you choose the garbage?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Probably, yeah. And 
I've said to the Minister, look, whenever the government's trying to do a
 better thing or the right thing, I'll be in support. I'll try to help 
them do things. I thought how they went about Petronas was wrong. I 
thought encouraging the company, facilitating the change before you 
issue the papers would have been the proper way of doing things. And not
 relying on really bad science. The science the Minister made her 
decision on was deplorable, was obviously bad and had been challenged. 
And the science we had, which was peer reviewed in I think it was 
Nature, was science they ignored. And it was like, OK, you've got 
company-sponsored science that every scientist looking at this says is 
junk, and you have this internationally-recognized, credible stuff. Why 
would you choose the garbage?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: Who are these scientists that are willing to make junk science? I'm kind of curious, who's the company hiring, do you know?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: I'd have to find the 
name of the company. I don't think they were Prince Rupert based, I 
think they were Vancouver. It'd be easy to find though. The stuff that 
was submitted, it was submitted by the company to CEAA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: Yeah, but I didn't see any scientist's name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: It would be the 
contractor. I forget which one it was, but normally they attach the 
person who did the research, though. Maybe not, but usually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: I'll have to dig 
deeper. I'm just kind of curious because are they involved in a lot of 
projects? Do you know of this company? Why do you say their scientists, 
why their science is such junk science? Besides the example of the bad 
fishing net.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Well, it was 
predicated on that. Also the company then went back into the water to 
find out how far the pilings would have to be driven, and it's three 
times deeper than their original report suggested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: For stability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Yeah. It's unusual — I don't know if you've looked, I think you have — but that little spot, the Flora Bank is fascinating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: It's a phenomenon of a spot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: It is not what I thought it was, which is just a bunch of eel grass and some silt that comes down the river.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: It's actually where these fish go, yeah.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Well aside from where they go, because that's what eel grass does in most places.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: It's where they mature, right?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Yeah, but it's the 
geology actually. It's a glacial deposit. If you knocked it out, it 
doesn't just reform next door, it's gone-gone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: It's not made by currents or anything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: No, because normally 
an estuary right at the end is just silt coming down and slowing down 
and just drops. This stuff is 8,000, 9,000 years old. It's a glacial 
deposit drop. And for that reason, keeping it stable — this is where the
 science comes in and it says if you dredge here and here, and then it 
shluffs then it's gone. You don't get it back. And then the fish — this 
is where the worry comes, is all the smolts head out and then, what? 
They've got to find other places to be, they've got to find that — and 
then on the way back in, same thing. So there's just no confidence that 
you could replace that, or that nature will replace it, or that you 
could plant some eel grass on the corners and there'd be enough. Where 
this is, where it sits, its protection from currents, is what the fish 
guys tell me is the reason the Skeena is so abundant. It's because of 
that. It's curious to me. I'm not a biologist — but I play one on TV — 
you'd say the Skeena has got a lot of fish because it's got a lot of 
fish in it. Well, there's lots of big rivers in the world in the 
northern hemisphere that are big and don't have anything going on. 
What's special about the north coast — and this goes true up to Alaska —
 is you get these interesting glacial things that happen at the last ice
 age that set up rearing, set up nurseries all up and down the coast. 
It's fascinating. I don't know, I get kind of jazzed on this stuff 
sometimes when you get into it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: It is pretty 
fascinating, but then I remember that I think this is the second most 
abundant fish river in B.C., and the first one doesn't have that. The 
first one — they also say that it's going to be too loud, it's going to 
be too bright — the other one goes through Vancouver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: In terms of the Fraser?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: Yeah. I'm just kind of curious why so many examples of why this part —</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Is so special.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: Is so special and needs protecting, and then there's the Fraser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: I can't speak to the Fraser at all. I don't know where the salmon rear off the Fraser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: The ocean? (Editor's note: no.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: No, you can't rear 
smolt in the ocean because the transition of lungs, the protection from 
predation, all of those things require some sort of protective habitat. 
That's just a standard salmon thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: No currents, getting battered by the ocean. Doesn't work for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Let me check about 
the Fraser. I don't know why it does why it does. This is what they tell
 me about the Skeena. Maybe what you're suggesting is there's sort of a 
biased angle on this, looking at this as a special thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: Suggesting it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: The challenge is, is 
it a risk you're willing to take? Like if you're right and it's no big 
thing and the Fraser's figured it out and there's no eel grass situation
 on the Fraser, and the fish sort of figure it out and they make it and 
they live and they thrive, great, then everybody's happy. If you're 
wrong, do you look back in 10 years and go, man, remember when we used 
to fish the Skeena. And I've got a bunch of lodge owners on my door, and
 I've got a bunch of commercial fishermen and everything else saying, 
how did this happen, man? We had this $115-million fishery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Interview paused for Nathan Cullen to answer a call from his wife.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: I wanted to ask this because it is a big deal for many in the valley: GMOs, what's your position?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't feel confident with the science right now, and I don't like how the companies operate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Oh, well our national
 policy is for labelling. Anytime you want to put it onto the shelves of
 consumers, they should, the consumer should be informed. I don't feel 
confident with the science right now, and I don't like how the companies
 operate. They sue people a lot. So they don't seem like good actors in 
the farming community. Terminator seeds — there's been a bunch of things
 that <span class="companylink">Monsanto</span> and others have done that don't fill me with a lot of confidence that food security is at the top of their priorities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: You've also heard the call from the regional district to having a ban across the regional district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: The past board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DV: And Smithers has declined to do that too, so is this something you've been in talks with —</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: Well, there seems to be some kind of accidental process here, where somebody put some crops in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CG: Not accidental. 
Speaking with the Ministry of Agriculture, which is why I talked about 
this, B.C. says it's a federal responsibility, the feds say yup, it's 
all up to <span class="companylink">Health Canada</span>. <span class="companylink">Health Canada</span>
 says farmers can whatever they want on their own land because it's a 
legal product. So it's not accidental, this guy moved here to grow 
crops. He's growing corn, he's testing some stuff with the Ministry ... 
but he's also grown canola, which is grown across the Prairies ... 
Terminator seeds are a problem with a lot of farmers, absolutely, they 
agree this is ridiculous. Heavy pesticide use is a problem, but that's a
 problem GMO or not. I think what a lot of people are worried about is 
you're painting the pesticide brush — I'm using a horrible analogy — but
 you're complaining about pesticides, but using the GMOs as the 
scapegoat, when GMOs — most scientific people would say — could have 
huge benefits, and do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NC: I've got to get you 
an article, it was in the Times last month. It was this incredible study
 just looking at the two main promises of GMOs: One is higher food 
production, and the second is lower pesticide use. That you sort of 
bioengineer pests out and then you don't need the pesticides. So there's
 a longitudinal study done between Canada, U.S. and Europe, where you 
had oranges to oranges, to use a bad metaphor as well. It sort of 
invalidated both extremes actually, but the promises of higher crop 
yield haven't been proven out, nor have the promises of lower pesticide 
use over a 30-year period now. So a pretty healthy length of time ...</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This
 article is regarding the two pipelines that were announced both 
provincially and federally. Many know that this is good for Alberta, 
however, are unsure what they are and how they will impact us. In order 
to understand I have compiled a few facts from the Kinder Morgan and 
Enbridge websites on the two pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> - Trans Mountain 
Replacement Pipeline Kinder Morgan Canada operates a number of pipeline 
systems and terminal facilities, but the pipeline that is of interest is
 the Trans Mountain which currently transports approximately 300,000 
barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and refined petroleum from the oil 
sands in Alberta to Vancouver, British Columbia and Washington state. 
The proposed $6.8 billion expansion of Trans Mountain, which would 
increase capacity to 890,000 bpd from its current capacity of 300,000 
bpd.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Enbridge</span> - Line 3 Replacement Pipeline 
Enbridge is a $7.5-billion Line 3 replacement existing pipeline will 
include all remaining segments of Line 3 between Hardisty, Alberta and 
Superior, Wisconsin. All told, the Line 3 Replacement Program will fully
 replace 1,031 miles (1,660 kilometres) of Line 3 with new pipeline and 
associated facilities on either side of the Canada-U.S. international 
border. This line is expected to have an initial capacity of 760,000 bpd
 from its current capacity of 360,000 bpd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These announcements for 
replacement pipelines are long overdue, but are welcomed as we are 
potentially adding almost one million barrels per day in capacity to 
help debottleneck getting our ethical oil to markets. We need shovels in
 the ground right now on these approved replacement pipelines and the 
Alberta Minister of Energy has committed to having these projects 
started within the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Prime Minister has credited Alberta's plan to cap greenhouse <b>gas</b>
 emissions for the approvals it is important to know that the federal 
government is also looking to implement its own social licence. Our 
federal Liberal government is forcing a nationwide carbon tax on all of 
us hoping Canadians will accept their senseless national carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have a Prime Minister that needs the Federal Carbon tax to work. We have a Premier that needs the Alberta Carbon tax to work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Prime Minister and 
Alberta Premier both have a mutual personal interest to make this 
happen. This carbon tax isn't about Alberta. It isn't about Canada. It 
is about their personal reputations that are at stake, and they are 
willing to do anything to achieve their radical ideological agendas that
 will cause direct harm to us all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As to the timing of their
 announcement we can look to the Keystone XL pipeline going to the 
United States. To the terror of our Prime Minister and Premier the 
Keystone XL pipeline is moving forward and that reinforces to Albertans 
that we don't need a <b>social license</b> to build pipelines. President
 Elect Trump has clearly signalled that the Keystone XL is a priority of
 the United States and secondly that he will not implement a carbon tax 
on the United States. This makes both levels of government in Canada 
look like this carbon tax is nothing more than a cash grab by the 
Alberta NDP and they won't let that happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be clear to respective
 governments and everyone else in Canada, we are not done with getting 
our product to market! We need pipelines in all directions and the 
announcement of the Enbridge Northern Gateway project along with of two 
replacement pipelines is distressing. The Northern Gateway was a NEW 
pipeline not the replacement of existing pipelines. Again it is 
important to mention that the replacement pipelines are good news, but 
new pipelines are just as important. The Northern Gateway would have 
meant $300 billion in GDP growth for our economy over the next 30 years,
 and thousands of badly -needed new jobs. The 'no' on Northern Gateway 
was really bad news for Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with the 'no' 
answer to a new pipeline we now have two of Premier Notley's top 
advisors on Alberta's own Oil Sands Advisory Group (OSAG), Karen Mahon 
and Tzeporah Berman, calling to shut down the federally approved 
replacement line. You just can't make this stuff up. With Karen Mahon 
stating "this pipeline will never be built" and Tzeporah Berman saying 
that "the math doesn't work" on emissions in regards with the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> we are now attacking our own pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why are Albertan's now 
paying for an advisory group that is working against our own people? 
AD{CS6241617} It is this type of confusing NDP messaging that is 
creating instability in Alberta. Through this instability we are seeing 
an environment that is preventing investment and more clearly preventing
 jobs in our riding. We are unsure how the NDP strategy of ignoring all 
those who oppose our pipelines is a good idea; Federal NDP, BC NDP and 
Saskatchewan NDP or our own Alberta advisory group to list a few. Our 
government must stand up for Albertans, not start to brag about how a <b>social license</b> that Albertan's neither asked for or want.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So let's celebrate the 
two new replacements lines, but remember that there is still work that 
needs to be done to get new lines out of Alberta. Without continues 
pressure the provincial NDP and federal Liberals appear to have no real 
drive to move forward Alberta's need to get our ethical energy to all 
markets. As your MLA I will remain committed to getting our energy to 
all markets so that we can get the best value for our energy products.</p>

 heavy oil costs must be reduced, and better technology is one way to do
 that. This week the Bulletin looks at some of the technologies that are
 being developed. Many&nbsp;were presented at the dmg :: 
events-organized&nbsp; World Heavy Oil Congress in Calgary earlier this 
fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As oil prices plunged 
over the past two years, several small SAGD projects shut down, and 
although some new projects obtained regulatory approval, none have 
started construction.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This
 is no reflection on SAGD’s technical performance. Up to now, the 
statistics speak for themselves. Output rocketed to about 840,000 bbls a
 day in 2015 from almost nothing at the turn of the century. But growth —
 as measured by construction starting on new SAGD projects — has been 
severely challenged since the benchmark West Texas Intermediate oil 
price collapsed from its mid-2014 level of more than US$100 a bbl.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAGD capital costs are 
high because of the large facilities needed for steam generation plus 
water treatment and recycling. Typical projects inject about three to 
five barrels of water for every barrel of bitumen produced. Most of the 
water is recycled, but the energy efficiency challenges the economics. 
And in an era of rising carbon penalties, SAGD’s environmental future 
has been questioned due to the emissions from burning natural <b>gas</b> to boil water for steam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developing cheaper and 
greener in-situ oilsands production methods is crucial as SAGD competes 
directly with production methods that don’t have the capital cost of 
elaborate surface facilities and the operating cost of burning <b>gas</b> for steam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why does this matter? 
More than 80 per cent of Alberta’s oilsands deposits are too deep to 
mine, so in-situ recovery technology is crucial. And SAGD is the only 
commercially proven in-situ recovery method for the Athabasca oilsands, 
which is the biggest of Alberta’s oilsands resources with tens of 
billions of bbls of bitumen recoverable by in-situ methods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, much of the 
highest-quality resource has already been developed, and as operators 
move into lower-quality acreage there are concerns about the economic 
viability of steam-based recovery methods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the size of the 
prize, companies are working on several new in-situ recovery methods 
that would reduce or eliminate the use of steam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Promising processes that 
are in advanced stages of development were reviewed in a paper presented
 at the World Heavy Oil Congress in September by Tom Harding and Bill 
MacFarlane, both of <span class="companylink">Nexen Energy ULC</span>, a unit of <span class="companylink">CNOOC Limited</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These include technologies to enhance SAGD and make it more efficient and profitable, and technologies designed to replace SAGD.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the technologies to
 enhance SAGD are: processes that add solvent to steam (solvent-assisted
 SAGD, or SA-SAGD, also known as expanding solvent SAGD, or ES-SAGD); 
non-condensable <b>gas</b> (NCG) such as methane added to steam; and surfactant added to steam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Processes designed to 
replace SAGD include: hybrid steam/in-situ combustion processes and 
electrical heating/solvent processes. These include Enhanced Solvent 
Extraction Incorporating Electromagnetic Heating (ESEIEH) and In-situ 
Reflux (ISR).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solvent without steam</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Helped by significant government funding, Nsolv Corporation has been piloting its pure solvent extraction method at <span class="companylink">Suncor Energy Inc</span>.’s Dover test site, north of Fort McMurray, since January 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nsolv process injects
 a pure, heated solvent vapour into a bitumen reservoir. Once inside the
 reservoir, the solvent condenses and dissolves into the bitumen, 
thereby lowering the oil’s viscosity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Founded by John Nenniger in 2003, privately held Nsolv sold an equity stake to engineering firm <span class="companylink">Hatch Ltd</span>. in 2004 and <span class="companylink">Enbridge Inc</span>.
 in 2006. The Climate Change and Emissions Management Corporation 
(CCEMC), created in 2008 by the Alberta government, provided two grants 
totalling $35 million to help fund the pilot. And last March, the 
company received federal funding of $13 million from Sustainable 
Development Technology Canada. (CCEMC has been rebranded as Emissions 
Reduction Alberta.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Nsolv uses no 
water, capital costs would be dramatically reduced because the 
water-handling and steam-generation facilities required for SAGD would 
be eliminated. Operating costs would be reduced because Nsolv consumes 
only a small amount of natural <b>gas</b> which is burned to heat the solvent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, Nsolv 
announced the pilot had produced more than 100,000 bbls of bitumen. And 
in a brief press release in September, Suncor said it would continue to 
test the technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In reply to Daily Oil 
Bulletin questions earlier this month, Nsolv CEO Joe Kuhach said: “The 
pilot is now in its final stages and we are working with Suncor to 
optimize the commercial design by testing various parameters.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An end date for the pilot has not yet been set, Kuhach said in an email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding solvent to steam</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past few years <span class="companylink">Imperial Oil Limited</span>
 has been adding diluent to injected steam on a commercial scale, but 
not for SAGD. The operator of the Cold Lake oilsands project uses its 
patented process called liquid addition to steam for enhancing recovery 
(LASER) to increase the volume of bitumen ultimately recovered from 
cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) wells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Imperial, the 
most experienced operator in steam/solvent injection in the Alberta 
oilsands, is adapting its knowledge to SAGD. The company has filed 
regulatory applications for two commercial-scale SA-SAGD projects — 
Aspen and the Cold Lake Expansion. Imperial has said the earliest it 
could sanction the projects would be 2017 for Aspen and 2018 for the 
Cold Lake Expansion. If the company decides to proceed with either 
project, the earliest first oil would flow would be next decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main concern with 
adding solvents to steam has been the cost of the hydrocarbons and the 
need to have high solvent recovery to make the process economic. Harding
 and MacFarlane believe steam/solvent injection will outperform 
steam-only injection in all reservoirs, but they recommend avoiding the 
leakiest reservoirs as this increases the economic risk. They note the 
leakiest reservoirs are also risky for pure steam injection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steam/non-condensable <b>gas</b> co-injection</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Field tests of non-condensable <b>gas</b>
 injection date back to the 1970s when Imperial ran trials associated 
with steam stimulation operations at Cold Lake. SAGD works efficiently 
as long as steam injected into the reservoir is heating bitumen. But 
once the steam reaches the top of the bitumen layer, heat is wasted into
 the overburden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To address this, the late
 Roger Butler, who patented the SAGD process for Imperial, also came up 
with a process called steam and <b>gas</b> push (SAGP). This involves co-injecting relatively small amounts of a non-condensable <b>gas</b>, such as methane, with steam early in the SAGD process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, several field tests have reported that co-injecting a non-condensable <b>gas</b>
 (such as methane) with steam has lowered the steam/oil ratio without 
hurting oil production. Most of the recent projects involving 
co-injection of non-condensable <b>gas</b> with steam have been late in the producing life of SAGD wells (DOB, Feb. 11, 2014).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An exception to the late-in-life rule is <span class="companylink">MEG Energy Corp</span>., which first pilot-tested co-injection of natural <b>gas</b> with steam on three well pairs at its Christina Lake SAGD project in January 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MEG’s approach to natural <b>gas</b> co-injection with steam differs from the typical industry practice in two ways. First, MEG uses <b>gas</b>
 co-injection in conjunction with infill wells. Second, it begins 
co-injection earlier in the SAGD process. MEG calls this version of SAGP
 “enhanced modified steam and <b>gas</b> push,” or eMSAGP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, MEG has applied eMSAGP to about a quarter of its production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MEG’s steam/oil ratio 
averaged 2.2 in the third quarter of this year, down slightly from 2.5 
in the corresponding 2015 period. But where eMSAGP has already been 
implemented, the company has cut its steam/oil ratio by half, said Davis
 Sheremata, a company spokesman. In other words, these well pairs now 
require about half as much steam to produce the same amount of bitumen. 
This frees up steam-generating capacity that can be used on other wells 
with no new investment in steam capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As well, MEG says its overall greenhouse <b>gas</b> emissions intensity is 30 per cent below the industry norm, and has the potential to be reduced even further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The oilsands producer 
hasn’t announced when it will roll out eMSAGP on wells that account for 
the remaining three-quarters of its production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, it doesn’t all have to be done in one project — eMSAGP can be implemented on as small a scale as one well at a time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But once it has been 
applied to all the company’s wells, MEG expects eMSAGP will increase its
 overall production by 20,000 bbls a day, Sheremata said in an email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A decision on the timing
 of these projects will depend on the maturity level of the reservoir, 
oil prices, cash flow and any other sources of funding we have 
available,” he wrote. “We are assessing a number of different options 
available to us.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steam/surfactant injection</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent research has been 
done on the potential benefits of adding surfactants to steam in SAGD, 
according to Harding and MacFarlane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A surfactant reduces the 
interfacial tension of a liquid in which it is dissolved — in effect, it
 can serve as a detergent that washes more oil from the rock. Alkaline 
surfactant polymer (ASP) floods have long been used on a commercial 
scale to increase ultimate recoveries in cold heavy oil production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But “much additional work
 is required to evaluate this promising method” of potentially enhancing
 thermal oil output, Harding and MacFarlane said in their paper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Studies and tests have 
been done to evaluate the potential of surfactants to reduce residual 
oil saturation and raise oil recovery by lowering interfacial tension, 
and also possibly improving relative permeability to oil and lowering 
oil viscosity,” the paper says. “Laboratory tests ... yielded 
recovery-factor increases between six and 16 per cent over a SAGD base 
case. It may be possible to cause the formation of oil-in-water 
emulsions, making the fluids more mobile.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it cautions: “The 
surfactants would have to be stable at steam temperatures and be able to
 lower the [interfacial tension] by orders of magnitude to have a 
significant effect.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hybrid steam/in-situ combustion (SAGDOX)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In-situ combustion — 
pumping air into a reservoir to ignite small amounts of bitumen to heat 
the rest of the bitumen so it will flow — has yet to achieve commercial 
success in the Alberta oilsands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disadvantages include 
problems with ignition and achieving high-temperature oxidation. The 
temperatures — which can exceed 600 C — can damage downhole equipment. 
And production of unreacted oxygen in the producer wells poses a safety 
and corrosion concern. If compressed air is used, it results in large 
quantities of non-condensable gases which can cause high <b>gas</b>/oil ratios and erosion of downhole equipment due to high <b>gas</b> velocities. It can promote sand production and reduce bitumen production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, using 
steam to lower the bitumen viscosity has enjoyed large-scale commercial 
success in Alberta for more than three decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But steam processes such 
as SAGD and CSS are energy intensive because fuel has to be burned to 
boil water, and they are inefficient because of the heat lost as steam 
moves from surface boilers through surface pipelines and down the 
wellbore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In-situ combustion is more energy efficient because heat is generated right in the reservoir, and the fuel is essentially free.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What if the benefits of SAGD and in-situ combustion could be combined to get the best of both worlds?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past few years <span class="companylink">Nexen</span> has been developing a hybrid steam/in-situ combustion process called SAGDOX in which oxygen would be injected with steam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main goal of SAGDOX 
is to reduce the cost of heating the reservoir, thereby improving the 
economics and extending SAGD to lower-quality reservoirs that otherwise 
might not be commercial. <span class="companylink">Nexen</span> believes SAGDOX may be particularly applicable to reservoirs with high water saturations, high shale content and thin pays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Injecting steam and 
oxygen — instead of just compressed air — is meant to solve some of the 
problems associated with in-situ combustion by eliminating nitrogen. 
(Earth’s atmosphere is about 78 per cent nitrogen, a non-condensable <b>gas</b>,
 and 21 per cent oxygen, plus other gases such as carbon dioxide. By 
injecting pure oxygen instead of compressed air, the amount of 
non-condensable <b>gas</b> in the reservoir is greatly reduced.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There may be other 
potential benefits. By preconditioning the reservoir with steam and then
 injecting oxygen, ignition is practically assured. Also, the highest 
temperatures may be moderated by the presence of steam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If nine per cent oxygen 
is injected with steam, half the heat provided to the reservoir would 
come from combustion and half from injected steam, <span class="companylink">Nexen</span>
 says in its paper. So if only half as much steam needs to be generated 
at surface, then half of the steam plant’s capacity could be redeployed 
to other wells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Energy efficiency is 
improved due to reduction in heat transfer inefficiencies during steam 
generation and steam-transmission heat losses in surface piping and 
wellbore as heat travels to the producing formation,” the paper says. It
 says greenhouse <b>gas</b> emissions and water consumption could be cut in half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harding and MacFarlane believe the combination of steam and oxygen injection (which reduces the amount of non-condensable <b>gas</b>
 generated in the reservoir that has to be produced from the production 
wells) will offer better oil production performance than an in-situ 
combustion process like Toe-to-Heel Air Injection (THAI).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They say combining steam 
with in-situ combustion offers much flexibility in terms of the average 
air or oxygen to steam ratio. More air — hence more nitrogen — could be 
injected in late life when more non-condensable <b>gas</b> is needed to maintain reservoir pressure or during wind down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company said further 
development of the SAGDOX process will focus on its main risks and 
uncertainties, including the management of combustion zone movement, the
 potential impacts of high temperatures on in-situ stresses and the 
handling of produced gases such as hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Electricity</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several of the new heating methods that have been proposed use electricity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These include: processes 
that pass current through the formation, causing resistive heating; 
electromagnetic heating that heats water present in the formation; radio
 frequency heating using long antennas to excite water molecules in the 
formation; and long resistive electrical heaters set at high temperature
 to heat the reservoir.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two processes that use 
electricity are currently being piloted; a third is at a much earlier 
stage of development. Two are using solvent in conjunction with the 
downhole heaters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radiofrequency heating</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best known of these 
replaces steam with radiofrequency heating and solvent injection. 
Radiofrequency heating would heat the reservoir in the way microwaves 
heat food.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A consortium that includes three major oil companies — Suncor, <span class="companylink">Nexen</span> and <span class="companylink">Devon Energy Corporation</span>
 — has been testing the process, which bears the unwieldy name of 
Enhanced Solvent Extraction Incorporating Electromagnetic Heating, or 
ESEIEH.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other consortium members are <span class="companylink">Harris Corporation</span>, the Melbourne, Florida-based technology provider, and Emissions Reduction Alberta, which provided $16.5 million for the pilot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radiofrequency energy 
heats water in the reservoir and this heat is transferred to the 
surrounding rock and oil. Near the radiofrequency antenna, water is 
heated to the boiling point, and the steam displaces the heated bitumen.
 Solvent is injected to help reduce the bitumen viscosity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like SAGD, ESEIEH 
(pronounced “easy”) uses long horizontal well pairs. As in SAGD, the 
lower well produces oil. But in an ESEIEH well pair, the upper well 
doesn’t inject steam. Instead, it holds the radiofrequency antenna and 
is also used for solvent injection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ESEIEH favours long wells
 — the longer the antenna, the longer the wavelength and the deeper the 
penetration into the formation. In a commercial application, solvent 
would be recovered from produced fluids for re-injection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Downhole testing began 
more than a year ago at Suncor’s Dover test site in northeast Alberta. 
The power was switched on from June to October 2015, then the downhole 
equipment was retrieved in November for troubleshooting. Downhole 
testing was to resume this spring, but was delayed by nearby wildfires. 
So instead the companies decided to modify the equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No oil production volumes have been announced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the ESEIEH 
process would entirely eliminate surface generation of steam, it would 
greatly reduce the capital cost of water-boiling and treating 
facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a paper presented at the Society of Petroleum Engineers Heavy Oil Technical Conference in Calgary last June, Spence Wise of <span class="companylink">Harris Corporation</span>
 and Chris Patterson of Devon Canada estimated a notional 
10,000-bbl-a-day bitumen project using ESEIEH could break even at a West
 Texas Intermediate oil price of roughly US$50 a bbl.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their economic analysis, 
based on reservoir simulations, considered a few scenarios. The paper 
cautioned that economic performance will vary based on reservoir 
characteristics, prevailing market forces and each operator’s unique 
implementation of the ESEIEH process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In-situ reflux</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Nexen</span> is also doing proof-of-concept lab testing and numerical simulation for a process called in-situ reflux.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In-situ reflux would use 
long resistive electric heaters in horizontal wells to vaporize connate 
water (water entrapped in sedimentary rock when the rock was deposited) 
to produce a rising steam chamber (DOB, Sept. 15, 2016).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small amounts of water 
and solvent would be injected to enhance the heat transfer into the 
formation and help reduce bitumen viscosity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As steam or vapourized 
solvent rises in the reservoir, it loses heat, and as it cools it 
condenses and flows downward with the melted bitumen. As these fluids 
approach the heater well, they encounter formation temperatures higher 
than the saturated steam temperature and the water would be re-vaporized
 and “refluxed” back into the steam chamber. Heated bitumen would 
continue to the production well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Injecting water or 
solvent would add a convective heat transfer component to the conduction
 heat transfer from the electric heater to the formation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capital costs would be 
much lower because steam generators would be eliminated and only a small
 water treatment plant would be needed. Burning natural <b>gas</b> to boil water would be eliminated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While in-situ reflux 
would require electricity, the total energy requirement would be less 
because in-situ steam generation would eliminate surface and wellbore 
heat losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In their paper, Harding 
and MacFarlane acknowledge in-situ reflux would have lower oil 
production rates than SAGD. But they said this would be partly offset by
 lower capital and operating costs. Because of the reduced volume of 
water injection and production, equipment for handling produced fluids 
would be only one-third the size required for SAGD and all pipelines and
 oil/water separation vessels would be significantly smaller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But unlike SAGD, in-situ 
reflux would have the cost of downhole heaters, extra wells (because of 
closer well spacing) and solvent purchases, the paper says. And while 
the volumes of injected water would be small compared to SAGD, the water
 quality will need to be high to avoid scaling on the heater surface. So
 the cost trade-off between steam injection versus electricity must also
 be considered, the paper says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perpetual’s electric heater pilot continuing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a pilot 
testing resistive electric heaters in a bitumen field in the Bluesky 
formation in northeast Alberta continues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last fall, <span class="companylink">Perpetual Energy Inc</span>.
 began the first phase of a planned two-phase field pilot on its Panny 
lands. The test site is about 77 kilometres north of Red Earth Creek 
(DOB, Sept. 16, 2016).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bitumen isn’t mobile under reservoir conditions, but the <b>gas</b> cap has been depleted through <b>gas</b>
 production, so injecting high-pressure steam wasn’t an option. So 
Perpetual is testing an extraction method that doesn’t use high-pressure
 steam injection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The process, which uses 
electric cable heaters, is called LEAD, which stands for Low-pressure 
Electro-thermally Assisted Drive. Designed to provide pressure support 
along with melting the bitumen, LEAD would supplement the electric heat 
with injected hot water and/or solvent to create a drive mechanism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phase 1 of the pilot uses
 a single horizontal well for both reservoir heating and oil production,
 cycling between a heating-only phase and a heating-and-production 
phase. The company calls this first phase of the pilot a cyclic heating 
stimulation (<span class="companylink">CHS</span>) test.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perpetual said results 
from the first two cycles exceeded expectations, with cumulative oil 
recovery surpassing forecasts. Oil volumes weren’t disclosed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late September, the 
third heating-and-production cycle began, but this time solvent was also
 injected. Production test operations are continuing through the fourth 
quarter and the company declined to disclose further detail at this 
point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&nbsp;Ultimate test</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The ultimate success of 
any potential new process ... will rest on the economic comparison 
between SAGD and new process and also on the ability of the new process 
to achieve the same or higher levels of resource recovery,” Harding and 
MacFarlane said in their paper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It added: “[The] 
economics of these processes will depend on the trade-off between the 
cost of the additives and equipment for their injection and the benefit 
in terms of additional oil production.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his World Heavy Oil 
Congress presentation, MacFarlane said the goal is to cut the cost of 
production: “We may have to move away from expectations of 
large-capacity wells. It really comes down to producing a cheaper 
barrel.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The paper concludes: 
“Ultimately the future of the in-situ recovery industry for extraction 
of oilsands resources may depend on the development of these lower-cost,
 more energy-efficient and lower-environmental-impact processes, 
especially if oil prices remain at their present levels for an extended 
period. The probability of higher taxes and penalties on carbon 
emissions must also be taken into account and anything that can be done 
to reduce carbon emissions in the extraction processes will have an 
economic benefit as well as a benefit in sustaining the <b>social license</b> to produce the [oilsands] and heavy oil resources.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Petrolympic management is
 pleased that the Quebec National Assembly passed Bill 106 on December 
10, 2016, An Act to implement the 2030 Energy Policy and amend various 
legislative provisions. Bill 106 includes the new Petroleum Resources 
Act, governing the development of petroleum resources in Quebec. 
Petrolympic believes that a stable framework for the development of 
Quebec hydrocarbon resources, previously governed by the Mining Act, is a
 key step for Quebec-based oil and <b>gas</b> production. Petrolympic 
management warmly welcome the enactment of this modern law for the 
development of Quebec's hydrocarbon resources, after 6 years of 
environmental consultations, public studies, and consideration of 
legislation in other jurisdictions.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Management is confident 
that developing local hydrocarbon resources is a positive step for the 
Province, as it will balance Quebec's energy portfolio and strengthen 
its economy, while reducing the energy import deficit. Petrolympic is 
fully committed to securing and maintaining the <b>social license</b> 
and local support for its operations. Petrolympic seeks the orderly and 
responsible commercial development of its Quebec oil and <b>gas</b> exploration licences, within the framework of the new Act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Petrolympic Ltd</span>.'s oil and <b>gas</b> 
land position in the Province of Quebec consists of a 100% interest in 5
 exploration permits covering 239,296 acres (96,840 hectares), a 30% 
interest in 36 exploration permits totaling 1,601,455 acres (648,093 
hectares), and a 12% interest in 19,768 acres (8,000 hectares). These 
Quebec exploration permits total 722,105 acres (291,730 hectares) net to
 Petrolympic's interest, of a gross land position of over 1.8 million 
acres (750,000 hectares).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebec's 2016 Petroleum 
Resources Act gives a framework for the development of the petroliferous
 Massé structure, jointly held by Petrolympic and Ressources &amp; 
Energy Squatex (Squatex). The Massé structure is covered by the 
companies' 1.6 million acres (656,000 hectares) of exploration permits 
(480,000 acres or 118,800 hectares net to Petrolympic's interest) in the
 lower St. Lawrence area. A second well drilled into the eastern Massé 
structure (Massé No. 2) has validated the exploration model over the 
eastern part of the structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Massé structure was 
re-evaluated in 2016 by Sproule and Associates ("Sproule"), independent 
Calgary, Alberta, based Reserve Evaluators. Sproule considers that 
results from 2015-2016 drilling could be extrapolated over an area of 
5.2 km[2]. According to Sproule's analysis of April 30, 2016, the 
porous, conventional reservoir rock encountered in the Silurian St. Leon
 and Sayabec Formations may host Gross Unrisked Undiscovered 
Unrecoverable Petroleum Initially-in-Place (PIIP) of 53.6 Bcf (billion 
cubic feet) of <b>gas</b> and 52.2 million barrels of oil on the eastern
 Massé structure, or 61.1 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE). 
Sproule's analysis of geophysical well logs shows net pay thickness in 
the St. Leon and Sayabec Formations of 66 to 210m, averaging 130m. 
Petrolympic management notes that this porous and permeable net pay is 
unlikely to require fracing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Management further notes 
that gross pay thickness of the petroliferous Silurian basin rock of the
 Lower Saint-Lawrence extends to nearly 540 metres. This large gross pay
 interval encourages further work on the Petrolympic Lower St. Lawrence 
Property. The Reserve Evaluation discussed in the previous paragraph 
implies 10.3 BCF and 10 MMbbl of Unrisked Petroleum Resources per km[2] 
in the area assessed by Sproule. Sproule did not evaluate seismic 
internal to the companies demonstrating that the Massé structure could 
extend over 80 km[2]. In addition, seismic attributes (apparent porosity
 anomalies) similar to those confirmed by the Massé No. 1 &amp; No. 2 
wells have been observed westwards on the Property. These seismic 
features were not considered by the Sproule in their evaluation of the 
Massé structure's hydrocarbon Resources. While these porosity anomalies 
are not validated or quantified by Sproule, their occurrence does 
represent significant potential upside for the Property.</p>

major land position in the unconventional Utica Shale Fairway in the St.
 Lawrence Lowlands as well as the Trenton-Black River carbonates, and

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 boards of Canadian public companies should think twice before designing
 executive compensation schemes, a Calgary business audience heard 
Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think [executive] 
compensation is the issue that creates the most division between 
management and the board,” said Randy Findlay, board chairman at Pembina
 Pipeline Corp.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Of
 the other day-to-day things that go on between [a public company’s] 
board and management, there’s usually very high alignment, but by 
definition, management and the board tend to be on opposite sides on 
[executive compensation],” he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At any given time, boards
 of directors are being pulled in different ways by various forces: 
shareholders, proxy advisers, and compensation advisors, among others, 
he said. At the same time, the directors themselves often bring their 
own biases to the table. Yet, at the end of the day, they “have the 
responsibility to do what is right for [their] company in that 
situation.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moderator of a 
three-person&nbsp; panel discussing executive compensation and 
shareholder alignment, Findlay was speaking to a meeting of the 
Institute of Corporate Directors, mainly an audience of corporate 
directors and executives, many from public companies in the oil and <b>gas</b> sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shareholder alignment was
 key to the discussion, and one panel member was blunt on the question 
of what sort of shareholders a public company ends up with. “You 
actually get the kind of shareholders that you deserve,” said Bruce 
Beingessner, a partner with investment management firm Jarislowsky 
Fraser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You should think about 
the kind of shareholders you want when you’re designing your program. If
 you have short-term incentives, you’ll attract short-term 
shareholders,” he said. “If you take a lot of risk, you’ll attract 
risk-loving shareholders.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short, boards faced 
with setting executive compensation need to take a “very long-term 
focus,” not only for the management team that’s in place, but also for 
the one that will replace them, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel also was asked 
why board members of public companies often “think they know what 
shareholders want.” In response, another panelist underscored a key 
point for board members. “As a first step, it’s important to know who 
your shareholders are, who your institutional investors are, and 
[realize that] those positions change with time,” said Sue MacKenzie, a 
board member at <span class="companylink">Enerplus Corporation</span> and other companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inviting shareholder 
feedback, both to management and the board, is also key, even it does 
not generate much response. “…Extending the invitation….can actually 
provide an avenue to gather important information about who your 
shareholders are and what are their expectations, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Return on investment</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to getting a
 return on investment, panelists were asked about weighing the return to
 company shareholders, versus the return to all of the company’s 
stakeholders, not only shareholders. Mackenzie said the board’s job is 
to consider the interests of the organization as a whole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stakeholders comprise a 
broad spectrum, from shareholders to communities, to business partners 
and employees. “I think there’s a direct link to the business case here,
 to be able to do that and demonstrate a return.” At the same time, she 
said, the return companies reap is sometimes financial, but sometimes 
“reputational.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An engineer who 
previously worked in the oilsands, MacKenzie said her then-employer 
enjoyed a good name among local service-providers in the company’s 
operating area. At the time, the oilsands sector was booming and service
 companies were in very short supply, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“[They] could pick and 
choose whom they would work with, which was a reversal from [how] the 
industry was operating until then. Having that sort of favoured-nation, 
first-priority approach to service-providers because of [our company’s] 
integrity in business was key to us being able to advance our business 
agenda,”she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also touching on the 
topic of returns to company shareholders, Findlay said the idea of 
extending returns, not only to shareholders, but to all of a company’s 
stakeholders, would likely cut returns to shareholders.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes, he said, the 
funds in question would go to good will or other “good things.” It’s 
“money that could be distributed to shareholders,” he said. Not everyone
 on the panel agreed on the premise, however.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s possible to 
increase [company] earnings and the stock price in the short term by 
taking advantage of stakeholders, be it customers, employees, the public
 or the broader environment, but that doesn’t work in the long term,” 
said Beingessner. “If you really want to make money for your 
shareholders in the long term, you really do have to serve all 
stakeholders.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the same question 
was put the audience, a former CEO agreed with that view. Some years 
back, he started a project that affected a range of stakeholders, 
including First Nations and local communities. “One of the things that 
worked … was to approach these groups, get them onside and make them 
part of the project,” he said. “We were ultimately successful in moving 
that forward in a relatively short period of time,” he said.” These 
days, they call it <b>social license</b>, [but] we earned [it] by simply engaging the other stakeholders.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Performance measurement and incentives</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Incentives for executives
 came in for some criticism, on the grounds that the schemes often work 
only for routine tasks, “crowd out” innovation and can lead to a gaming 
of the system by some executives. On these and other grounds, Findlay 
asked panel members if boards should considering stopping “paying for 
performance” altogether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One panelist took issue 
with the idea. Despite having real concerns about executive 
compensation, “we would never say just give up on [performance 
measurement],” said Beingessner. “You’ve got to try set compensation for
 performance. It’s absolutely key.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, he 
offered comments on the idea that some executives might try ‘gaming’ the
 system. “I believe people are ethical and are not going to 
intentionally set out to game the system. However, when you set up 
incentives for [executives], you have to be aware that [those] will 
influence their behavior and you don’t want to make it hard for people 
to act in an ethical way.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In particular, one 
incentive that can create misalignment is stock options, said 
Beingessner. An executive at a public company might have to decide on 
making a risky investment. If the executive holds only stock options 
that are out-of-the-money, and if that person &nbsp;is not a company 
shareholder, their approach may be that there is everything to gain and 
nothing to lose. “That’s going to potentially distort your perception.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, if the
 same executive is a shareholder, not just an option-holder, it changes 
the picture entirely. “In that case, you do have something to lose, and 
it’s going to change the way you look at the world, even if it’s 
subconscious,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unintended consequences</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Above all, Beingessner 
said, corporate boards need to be aware of unexpected consequences in 
crafting executive compensation and incentive programs. He cited the 
case of a chief executive who is approached by a competitor interested 
in buying out the executive’s company. The issue becomes whether or not 
to sell, but is complicated by a change-of-control provision that 
rewards the CEO if the company is bought out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You need to be aware of 
the unintended consequences of the [executive] incentives you put 
together,” Beingessner said. “We see a lot of potential for unintended 
consequences in a lot of the compensation plans out there.”</p>
