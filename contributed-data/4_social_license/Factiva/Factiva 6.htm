<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently
 in Ontario, Premier Doug Ford summarily scrapped Ontario's cap-andtrade
 program, which would have burdened Ontario companies with costly carbon
 accounting and sent millions of Ontario's dollars to California to buy 
carbon credits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2017, Ontarians paid nearly $2 billion annually as the cost of cap-and-trade was passed onto consumers.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover,
 Ontario will cancel some 758 contracts for renewable power, saving the 
province another $790 million while helping reduce power prices for 
Ontarians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides partying at 
Stampede and doing aerial acrobatics, what has Premier Rachel Notley 
done to increase investment attractiveness in Alberta? Let's review. 
Since coming to office, she raised corporate income taxes to 12% from 
10% - a hike of about 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And discouraged wealthier folks, who might live and invest here, by killing Alberta's highly attractive flat income tax rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Due to this tax hike, 
which went from 10% up to 15% for high earners, Albertans who earn more 
than $300,000 per year saw their taxes rise 50%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP government has 
also stacked a daunting pile of regulatory bricks onto the back of a 
prostrate industry when it was reeling from a massive drop in <b>oil</b> prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Canada's energy 
sector was down, they were hit with Premier Notley's "Climate Leadership
 Plan," which expanded and increased Alberta's carbon tax to $30/tonne 
of emissions, and will ostensibly follow the Trudeau government's 
federal plan to raise the tax to $50/tonne by 2022, as her contingent 
condition of getting a pipeline built was satisfied by Ottawa's purchase
 of the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain expansion project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the tax 
hikes, the government put a hard cap on the emissions of greenhouse 
gases from the oilsands, limiting them to 100 megatonnes per year, a 
constraint which could start to bite in the mid-2020s, threatening the 
viability of longterm projects and costing the economy billions in lost 
production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's Climate 
Leadership Plan also includes a commitment to phase out coal-generated 
electricity by 2030, triple renewable energy to supply 30% of generation
 by 2030, further reduce methane emissions from the <b>oil</b> and gas 
sector, and create a new agency to spend Alberta's carbon tax revenues 
on energy-efficiency programs with a very poor record of success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drove up prices</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are the kind of policies that drove up energy prices in Ontario and drove investment and jobs out of the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simply put, as Ontario 
steps back from cap-andtrade and wind and solar power, Alberta forges 
ahead with burdensome regulations, renewable energy subsidies and higher
 taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And all of this after the spectacular failure of Premier Notley's "<b>social license</b>" dream that was never going to be granted by environmentalists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, we now have a 
precedent that, if pipelines are to be built, the government must fund 
them or indemnify them with Alberta's and Canada's tax dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the premier is serious about rebuilding Alberta's <b>oil</b>
 and gas sector, she should get off the Stampede zip-line and start 
removing the bricks she put on the back of Alberta's energy economy, to 
make Alberta a profitable place to invest with a more predictable and

 pundits should not be so quick to write off the new Doug Ford-Scott Moe
 alliance against the federal carbon tax. Yes, they were the only two of
 the 10 premiers in New Brunswick this week to announce their support 
for a constitutional challenge to the federal law. And yes 
constitutional experts are correct in predicting that this legal 
challenge is not likely to succeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But winning in the legal 
battle does not mean winning the policy war. Obstructionist provincial 
governments can gum up federal policies whose effective implementation 
require provincial co-operation. Witness how B.C. Premier Phil Horgan 
and his anti-pipeline allies have succeeded in delaying the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline expansion despite losing 17 consecutive court decisions.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With
 respect to the carbon tax, the law may be on the side of Ottawa, but 
time and politics are not. Saskatchewan's reference to its court of 
appeal won't be decided for another nine months. Whoever loses will 
appeal to the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>, 
which will take another year or more to be heard and then decided. By 
then, there will have been a spring election in Alberta and a federal 
election in the fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Alberta, Conservative 
leader Jason Kenney is promising to scrap that province's carbon tax if 
he wins next year's election. All current polling suggests that he will.
 Manitoba has adopted its own version of a carbon tax, but the price it 
places on CO2 is below the minimum demanded by the federal plan. Premier
 Pallister has warned that if Ottawa tries to force it higher, "we'll 
see you in court." PEI has adopted a climate change plan with no carbon 
tax - a policy that clearly does not meet federal regulations. And if 
anti-tax momentum builds, the Newfoundland and New Brunswick premiers 
have warned that they are not going impose a tax on their voters that 
consumers and businesses in six or seven other provinces are not paying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Jason Kenney speaks to the media at his first convention as leader of 
the United Conservative Party in Red Deer, Alta., Sunday, May 6, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With next year's federal 
election fast approaching, this is potential nightmare scenario for 
Trudeau and the Liberals. Do they want to make the ballot-issue a new 
tax that will make it more expensive for voters to fill up their cars, 
heat their homes and turn on their lights? Maybe this won't make any 
difference in Saskatchewan and Alberta, where the Liberals only have 
five MPs. But in Ontario - where Doug Ford just won by promising to 
scrap the tax - the Liberals have 80 MPs seeking re-election. Losing 
even a quarter of these would jeopardize their 183 seat government, 
which is only 13 over the 170 minimum required for a majority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2015, many 
centre-right voters supported Trudeau simply because they were tired of 
Stephen Harper. But in 2018, they supported Doug Ford because they were 
tired of sky-rocketing electricity and gas prices. If in 2019 Trudeau 
takes a hardline on bringing back the very carbon tax that Premier Ford 
has just repealed, he risks losing some of these former supporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the alternative - 
backing off on the carbon tax - has its own risks. Promising action on 
climate change was one of the issues that helped Trudeau win in 2015. 
With the help of the U.S.-financed environmental NGO (ENGO) LeadNow, the
 Liberals targeted 29 Conservative-held ridings in which their polling 
indicated that climate change was a priority for voters. Liberal 
candidates subsequently won 25 of these seats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these same 
centre-left voters that supported Trudeau in 2015 are no longer so happy
 with him. Many are angry about the federal government's $4.5 billion 
bailout of the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline 
expansion in B.C. If Trudeau now backs down on his national carbon tax 
pledge, many of his 2015 supporters for whom climate action is still a 
priority may drift off to the NDP in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underlying the Liberals' carbon tax dilemma is the spectacular failure of the Trudeau-Notley "<b>social license</b>"
 gambit: their belief that in return for their various carbon reduction 
policies, climate change ENGOs would acquiesce in Canada's economic need
 to build the Kinder Morgan TransMountain expansion. Whatever 
plausibility this trade-off strategy may have had initially has now been
 destroyed. The anti-Kinder Morgan forces - the Horgan government, U.S. 
and Canadian climate ENGOs and B.C. aboriginal groups - have accelerated
 their opposition to TransMountain, not backed off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor are they shy about 
explaining why. When CBC asked Bill McKibben( 
http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1100225603963[http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1100225603963]
 ), founder of <span class="companylink">350.org</span>, why he would 
not give Trudeau and Notley any credit for Canada's carbon reduction 
policies, he stated a simple fact: that at only two per cent of global 
emissions, what Canada does on the domestic "demand" side to reduce our 
emissions is too small to make any difference. What will make a 
difference, McKibbon continued, is preventing the further development of
 the Canadian <b>oil</b> sands - the third largest reserve on the world. "To stop the <b>oil</b> sands, we have to stop all pipelines."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The failure of his <b>social license</b> strategy forced Trudeau to rescue the TransMountain expansion with the $4.5 billion dollar purchase of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada</span>.
 This did not win him many new friends in Alberta or Saskatchewan, but 
infuriated many of his erstwhile climate change supporters in Ontario 
and British Columbia. With an election only a year away, the carbon tax 
issue threatens to push the Liberals even deeper into a political corner
 with no easy way out.</p>

 natural gas expands its role in energy systems around the world, the 
industry will need to curb its methane leakage to maintain its <b>social license</b>
 and to minimize its impacts on the developing economies it hopes to 
serve, an array of methane experts said at the World Gas Conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Climate change has the 
potential to destabilize growing and struggling marketplaces, and energy
 operators looking to sell their resources in those markets should be 
mindful that adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere could inhibit 
economic growth, Rachel Kyte, CEO of Sustainable Energy for All, said 
June 28 at the Washington, D.C., event.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Gas
 will not be a solution for poverty in a world where climate change is 
driving more people into poverty unless you fix your methane problem and
 fix it quick," Kyte said during a keynote address. "My message to you 
is I think there's a very important role for gas in cleaning the energy 
mix, in reaching people who don't have reliable and affordable energy 
today, in helping their economies grow, but let's not leave the room 
with the elephant still in there, untouched."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reducing methane on a 
global scale would be likely to require public-private partnerships, in 
addition to "very strong" regulatory regimes, she said. Her organization
 was founded by former U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <b>oil</b> and gas industry is "only as good as the lowest common denominator," Richard Ward, global methane program director at the <span class="companylink">Rocky Mountain Institute</span>, told a panel of methane experts June 26 at the same event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some companies have made 
commitments to reduce methane emissions, but the less proactive 
operators may increasingly put the industry as a whole in the crosshairs
 of environmental advocates looking to hold down greenhouse gas 
emissions, Ward said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Those are your brethren," Ward said. "Those [companies] emit the same molecules to the same sky for the same global warming."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operators should not 
assume the issue of methane emissions will not affect them if they keep a
 low profile, said Jennifer Stewart, Southwestern Energy Co.'s vice 
president of government and regulatory affairs. Stewart, who was on the 
June 26 panel, agreed that there is a need to bring lagging companies 
along when it comes to minimizing methane emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and her colleague Roy
 Hartstein, Southwestern's vice president of strategic solutions, 
indicated that they are "agnostic" about whether regulations are the 
appropriate way to restrict methane emissions from <b>oil</b> and gas 
operations. Hartstein highlighted changing practices among operators in 
recent decades that have already limited the amount of methane that 
companies release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a pair of scientists cautioned against overestimating how much progress the <b>oil</b> and gas sector has made on reducing emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There have been 
assertions that the rate of emissions is going down. I don't know if 
that's true, and I don't know if anyone else knows that that's true," 
Steven Hamburg, chief scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, said 
during a question session after the panel discussion. "There are 
well-documented improvements in some practices. The trouble is ... we 
can document those, we can applaud those, but in the aggregate, we can't
 say, 'If we continue the trend we're on now, we're going to get to 
where we need to be.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atmospheric methane levels have increased but not at the same rate as <b>oil</b>
 and gas operations have expanded in recent decades, said Stefan 
Schwietzke, a research scientist at the University of Colorado and the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Even if all the 
increase in methane emissions has been from the fossil fuel industry, 
the disparity between methane and development growth rates indicates 
that the <b>oil</b> and gas sector has gotten more efficient at holding in its emissions, Schwietzke said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But all these 
improvements, they have been counteracted by increased production," 
Schwietzke said. "We can increase our efficiency, reduce emissions per 
well ... but if we're doubling the wells, doubling production, we see 
the same methane in the atmosphere."</p>

<span class="companylink">Horizon Petroleum</span> Announces NI51-101 Reserves and -2-</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">History and Development Plan</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lachowice field is at
 an early stage of conventional natural gas development. Lachowice-1, 
Lachowice-7 and Stryszawa-2K are the primary wells of interest on the 
field and, despite being essentially vertical in their design and 
utilizing sub-optimal drilling and completion methods for naturally 
fractured formations, tested at rates of up to 5.8 MMcf/d, 8.9 MMcf/d, 
and 2.5 MMcf/d, respectively. Each of these wells was drilled and 
tested, with reservoir depths of 3,000-4,000 meters targeting a 
naturally fractured carbonate reservoir of Middle Devonian age. The 
natural gas is sweet, with up to 91% methane and 7 bbls/MMcf of 
condensate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following receipt of the 
Reserves Report, Horizon is currently in the process of finalizing its 
development plan. In general, it is currently anticipated that the 
development plan would begin with a new vertical well offsetting the 
Lachowice-7 location. Provided Horizon successfully closes the 
Acquisition, it is targeting to drill and test the well in the first 
half of 2019, with first production to occur by late 2019, with natural 
gas sales initially facilities constrained at approximately 3.0 MMcfe/d.
 The wells will produce natural gas under primary drive via the natural 
fractures and the matrix porosity within the reservoir. The project is 
considered pre-development and is expected to cost approximately US$7.5 
million to first production. In a previous press release dated September
 19, 2017, Horizon had stated it was targeting first production from the
 Lachowice field by the second half of 2018. The regulatory process has 
proceeded slower than anticipated, and therefore the conversion of the 
concessions to the new Polish concession laws, and approvals related to 
Horizon taking operatorship of the concessions, has taken longer than 
expected. It is Horizon's understanding that the Polish government is 
currently considering these concessions, and the conversion and 
approvals are expected within the next six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new horizontal or 
highly deviated well and a horizontal or highly deviated re-entry of the
 new vertical well (targeting &gt;300m natural gas column) would be 
drilled in mid-2020, increasing production to 17.5 MMcfe/d at a new 
processing facility expected to be operational in late 2020. Drilling 
would continue with production increases to over 30 MMcfe/d thereafter. 
Operating netbacks are expected to be approximately US$6.80 per Mcfe, 
based on current pricing. Timing of the development is subject to 
regulatory approvals, and Horizon has initiated efforts to begin and 
fast-track the regulatory process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other Assets - France</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In France, the government passed a law on December 30, 2017 preventing new <b>oil</b>
 and natural gas licences to be issued, and all production on existing 
permits to cease by 2040. The Company has allowed its Ger licence to 
expire and has applied for a three-year extension on its Ledeuix 
licence. To the Company's knowledge, other companies operating in France
 have received extensions, and as such the Company has no reason to 
believe that it will not receive approval on the extension in 12-18 
months. Currently, as there is no clarity on timing to first production,
 the Company will initiate the seismic and drilling applications but 
reduce all expenditures in France to minimum levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">C$5 Million Financing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horizon proposes to raise
 up to C$5 million through a private placement, issuing up to 
100,000,000 common shares at a price of $0.05 per share. The net 
proceeds are to be used to close the Acquisition, prepare the assets for
 development and for general corporate purposes. Horizon has entered 
into an engagement agreement with Gneiss Energy Limited, a London, 
United Kingdom based energy-focused advisory practice, for the purposes 
of raising new equity in Europe. In addition, Horizon will raise 
additional funds from Canadian and certain UK investors on a 
non-brokered basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horizon is currently 
examining options for improving the Company's trading liquidity, access 
to new equity capital in Europe and profile alongside its international 
E&amp;P peers. As part of these deliberations, Horizon may consider 
listing on another exchange, such as the <span class="companylink">London Stock Exchange</span>. In the event the Company decides to undertake an additional listing, it expects to execute a plan within the next 6-12 months.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reserve and resource 
estimates contained in this press release have been prepared in 
accordance with NI 51-101, is dated as of January 31, 2018 and prepared 
by APEX.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reserve and resource 
estimates of natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves provided in 
this news release are estimates only, and there is no guarantee that the
 estimated reserves and/or resources will be recovered. Actual reserves 
and resources may eventually prove to be greater than, or less than, the
 estimates provided herein. It should not be assumed that the estimates 
of future net revenues presented herein represent the fair market value 
of the reserves and/or resources. There are numerous uncertainties 
inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and natural gas liquids
 reserves and/or resources and the future cash flows attributed to such 
reserves and/or resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These risks and 
uncertainties include but are not limited to: (i) the fact that there is
 no certainty that the zones of interest will exist to the extent 
estimated or that the zones will be found to have natural gas with 
characteristics that meet or exceed the minimum criteria in terms of net
 pay thickness and/or porosity, or that the natural gas will be 
commercially recoverable to the extent estimated; (ii) the fact that 
there is no certainty that any portion of the probable reserves and 
contingent and prospective resources will be commercially viable to 
produce; (iii) the fact that the Company must hire an operations team 
and executive team in both Calgary and Poland in order to execute on the
 development plan, and there are no guarantees that suitably qualified 
technical and professional staff and/or consultants will be available; 
(iv) the lack of additional financing to fund the Company's development 
activities and continued operations; (v) the risks associated with 
obtaining approvals to access land to drill wells or install 
infrastructure and facilities in a reasonable time frame; the Polish 
regulatory regime is relatively stable but is marked with long approval 
processes relative to North American jurisdictions; (vi) the risks in 
acquiring or constructing adequate natural gas infrastructure to produce
 and sell natural gas, and whether capacity will be available in the 
existing main pipeline system at reasonable costs; (vii) the risk that 
there may not be a drilling rig available to drill the required wells, 
and the risk that if a rig mobilization is required from outside of 
Poland, that the costs may be prohibitive; (ix) risks inherent in the 
international <b>oil</b> and natural gas industry; (x) fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates; (xi)the number of competitors in the <b>oil</b>
 and gas industry with greater technical, financial and operations 
resources and staff; (xii) fluctuations in world prices and markets for <b>oil</b>
 and natural gas due to domestic, international, political, social, 
economic and environmental factors beyond the Company's control; (xiii) 
changes in government regulations affecting <b>oil</b> and natural gas 
operations; (xiv) potential liabilities for pollution or hazards against
 which the Company cannot adequately insure or which the Company may 
elect not to insure; (xv) contingencies affecting the classification as 
reserves versus resources which relate to the following issues as 
detailed in the COGE Handbook: ownership considerations, drilling 
requirements, testing requirements, regulatory considerations, 
infrastructure and market considerations, timing of production and 
development, and economic requirements; (xvi) the fact that there is no 
certainty that any portion of the prospective resources will be 
discovered and if discovered, there is no certainty that it will be 
commercially viable to produce any portion of the resources; and (xvii) 
other factors beyond the Company's control.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resources are defined in the Canadian <b>Oil</b> and Gas Evaluation Handbook (COGEH) Volume 1, section 5 as follows:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources are 
those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from known accumulations, but the applied 
projects are not yet considered mature enough for commercial development
 due to one or more contingencies. Contingent Resources may include, for
 example, projects for which there are currently no viable markets, or 
where commercial recovery is dependent on technology under development, 
or where evaluation of the accumulation is insufficient to clearly 
assess commerciality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingencies may include
 factors such as economic, legal, environmental, political, and 
regulatory matters, or a lack of markets. It is also appropriate to 
classify as contingent resources, the estimated discovered recoverable 
quantities associated with a project in the early evaluation stage. 
Contingent Resources are further classified in accordance with the level
 of certainty associated with the estimates and may be sub classified 
based on project maturity and/or characterized by their economic status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all technically 
feasible development plans will be commercial. The commercial viability 
of a development project is dependent on the forecast of fiscal 
conditions over the life of the project. For Contingent Resources, the 
risk component relating to the likelihood that an accumulation will be 
commercially developed is referred to as the "chance of development." 
For contingent resources, the chance of commerciality is equal to the 
chance of development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development Pending are 
contingencies that are being actively pursued; expect resolution in a 
reasonable time period; are directly influenced by the developer with 
both, internal approvals and commitment and development timing and; have
 a high chance of development (&gt;80%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development on Hold are 
contingencies with major non-technical contingencies identified; have a 
reasonable chance of development (&gt;50%); have contingencies that are 
beyond the control of the developer including but not limited to: 
external approvals, economic factors, market access, political factors 
and <b>social license</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development Unclarified 
are contingencies that have not been clearly defined; the project is 
currently under active evaluation; significant further appraisal may be 
required; progress is expected in a reasonable time period; chance of 
development is difficult to assess and could be a big range (20%-80%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development Not Viable 
are contingencies that have been identified; the project was evaluated 
and considered not viable or significant further appraisal may be 
required; progress is not expected in a reasonable time period and; has a
 low chance of development (&lt;&lt;50%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources 
--Development Pending and --Development On Hold are considered economic,
 Contingent Resources --Development Unclarified have economics that are 
undetermined, and Contingent Resources --Development Not Viable are 
considered sub-economic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective Resources are
 those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application 
of future development projects. Prospective resources have both an 
associated chance of discovery and a chance of development. Prospective 
Resources are further subdivided in accordance with the level of 
certainty associated with recoverable estimates assuming their discovery
 and development and may be sub classified based on project maturity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all exploration 
projects will result in discoveries. The chance that an exploration 
project will result in the discovery of petroleum is referred to as the 
"chance of discovery." Thus, for an undiscovered accumulation, the 
chance of commerciality is the product of two risk components -- the 
chance of discovery and the chance of development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estimates of resources 
always involve uncertainty, and the degree of uncertainty can vary 
widely between accumulations/projects and over the life of a project. 
Consequently, estimates of resources should generally be quoted as a 
range according to the level of confidence associated with the 
estimates. An understanding of statistical concepts and terminology is 
essential to understanding the confidence associated with resources 
definitions and categories. These concepts, which apply to all 
categories of resources, are outlined below. The range of uncertainty of
 estimated recoverable volumes may be represented by either 
deterministic scenarios or by a probability distribution. Resources 
should be provided as low, best, and high estimates as follows: </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">   -- Low Estimate and/or 1C in the case of Contingent Resources: This is 
      considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity that will 
      actually be recovered. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities 
      recovered will exceed the low estimate. If probabilistic methods are used, 
      there should be at least a 90 percent probability (P90) that the 
      quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the low estimate. 
 
   -- Best Estimate and/or 2C in the case of Contingent Resources: This is 
      considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will actually be 
      recovered. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities 
      recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate. If 
      probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50 percent 
      probability (P50) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or 
      exceed the best estimate. 
 
   -- High Estimate and/or 3C in the case of Contingent Resources: This is 
      considered to be an optimistic estimate of the quantity that will 
      actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual remaining 
      quantities recovered will exceed the high estimate. If probabilistic 
      methods are used, there should be at least a 10 percent probability (P10) 
      that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the high 
      estimate. </pre>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This approach to 
describing uncertainty may be applied to reserves, contingent resources,
 and prospective resources. There may be significant risk that sub 
commercial and undiscovered accumulations will not achieve commercial 
production, however, it is useful to consider and identify the range of 
potentially recoverable quantities independently of such risk.</p>

identified in the Lachowice Reserves Report are the successful 
recompletion of existing abandoned wells, the expected decline rates and

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This press release 
contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information 
(collectively "forward-looking information") within the meaning of 
applicable securities laws relating to the Company's plans and other 
aspects of our anticipated future operations, management focus, 
strategies, financial, operating and production results, industry 
conditions, commodity prices and business opportunities. In addition, 
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this press release
 contains forward-looking information regarding anticipated netbacks, 
anticipated potential of the Acquisition, the closing and timing of the 
Acquisition, the timing of the remaining regulatory approvals to close 
the Acquisition, the closing and timing of closing of the Financing, the
 use of proceeds from the Financing, decisions regarding additional 
listings, production guidance, capital program and allocation thereof, 
future production, development and drilling plans, well economics, 
future cost reductions, potential growth, the extension of the Ledeuix 
licence and the current operating plans with respect to the Company's 
assets in Franceas well as the source of funding the Company's capital 
spending. Forward-looking information typically uses words such as 
"anticipate", "believe", "project", "expect", "goal", "plan", "intend" 
or similar words suggesting future outcomes, statements that actions, 
events or conditions "may", "would", "could" or "will" be taken or occur
 in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The forward-looking 
information is based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by
 Horizon's management, including expectations and assumptions noted 
previously in this press release under <b>oil</b> and gas advisories, 
and in addition with respect to prevailing commodity prices and 
differentials, exchange rates, interest rates, applicable royalty rates 
and tax laws; future production rates and estimates of operating costs; 
performance of future wells; reserve and resource volumes; anticipated 
timing and results of capital expenditures; the success obtained in 
drilling new wells; the sufficiency of budgeted capital expenditures in 
carrying out planned activities; the timing, location and extent of 
future drilling operations; the state of the economy and the exploration
 and production business; results of operations; performance; business 
prospects and opportunities; the availability and cost of financing, 
labour and services; the impact of increasing competition; the ability 
to efficiently integrate assets and employees acquired through 
acquisitions, including the Acquisition, the ability to market natural 
gas successfully and Horizon's ability to access capital. Although the 
Company believes that the expectations and assumptions on which such 
forward-looking information is based are reasonable, undue reliance 
should not be placed on the forward-looking information because Horizon 
can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct. Since 
forward-looking information addresses future events and conditions, by 
its very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Horizon's
 actual results, performance or achievement could differ materially from
 those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking information and,
 accordingly, no assurance can be given that any of the events 
anticipated by the forward-looking information will transpire or occur, 
or if any of them do so, what benefits that we will derive therefrom. 
Management has included the above summary of assumptions and risks 
related to forward-looking information provided in this press release in
 order to provide securityholders with a more complete perspective on 
future operations and such information may not be appropriate for other 
purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Readers are cautioned 
that the foregoing lists of factors are not exhaustive. These 
forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this press release
 and we disclaim any intent or obligation to update publicly any 
forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, 
future events or results or otherwise, other than as required by 
applicable securities laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This press release 
contains future-oriented financial information and financial outlook 
information (collectively, "FOFI") about Horizon's prospective results 
of operations, operating netbacks and components thereof, all of which 
are subject to the same assumptions, risk factors, limitations and 
qualifications as set forth in the above paragraphs. FOFI contained in 
this press release was made as of the date of this press release and was
 provided for the purpose of providing further information about 
Horizon's anticipated future business operations. Readers are cautioned 
that the FOFI contained in this press release should not be used for 
purposes other than for which it is disclosed herein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Non-GAAP Measures</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This press release 
includes non-GAAP measures as further described herein. These non-GAAP 
measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by International 
Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS" or, alternatively, "GAAP") and 
therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures
 by other companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operating netbacks are determined by deducting royalties, net profit interest, production expenses and selling expenses from <b>oil</b> and gas revenue. Operating netbacks are per mcfe measures used in operational and capital allocation decisions. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre"> 
The assumptions used to generate the netback (US$/Mcfe) in this press release 
are as follows: 
Daily Production(1)                                 17.65 MMcfe/d 
Commodity Revenue (2)                                 US$4.57 MM 
Royalties and 6% NPI                                 US$ 0.57 MM 
Operating Cost(1)                                    US$ 0.28 MM

Operating Netbacks                                   US$6.82/Mcfe 
 
 
(1) Daily production and operating costs are management's best estimate of the 
production and operating costs from the anticipated wells and is based on all 
of the assumptions outlined in the above paragraphs; (2)Based on Lachowice 
Natural Gas Price = US$8.63/mcf, Condensate Price = US$72.00/Bbl, CAD/USD=

Tell your story. Be fully transparent — it’s valuable and expected in 
today’s market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shareholders and 
customers are changing the degree to which companies are demonstrating 
“transparency” in their day-to-day activities by asking important 
questions of executives. Questions such as: Why should I work with your 
company? What are the risks in partnering? What <b>social license</b> do
 you have to operate in my community? What does your company stand for 
in areas like ethics, diversity, community, or health and safety?</p>

network of touch points, technology creates a tangible business 
opportunity to be transparent, ultimately to generate relationships, 
solidify your brand, and increase market share,” said Bill Whitelaw, CEO

core, the business value of transparency is credibility. By not using 
transparency and technology in tandem, you’re missing out on a genuine 
business opportunity and your brand will struggle.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remind yourself that your
 brand has an intrinsic business value — marketing is critical to 
growth. Reinvest by stimulating your ad spend, but don’t invest with 
just any company. By strategically partnering with JWN Energy, you can 
be assured of:</p>

 - To understand the counterintuitive political calculus behind Justin 
Trudeau's controversial decision to buy the Trans Mountain pipeline, one
 has to go back to the fundamental equation that has governed this prime
 minister's energy and climate change policies since his days in 
opposition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That Trudeau had no 
choice but to take over the pipeline if he wanted to ensure that the 
plan for its expansion did not die on the drawing board is not in 
question. By the time Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced the 
federal decision Tuesday, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> - the pipeline's parent company - was about to pull the plug on the project.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But
 the real question is why would the Liberal government be willing to put
 an open-ended amount of political and financial capital on the line to 
keep it alive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If one connects the dots 
between most major policies that past governments have deemed to be in 
the national interest, one almost always finds they conveniently 
intersected with a ruling party's election prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Stephen Harper's decision to bail out the auto industry in 2009 was not 
unrelated to the fact that his path to a coveted majority government ran
 through Ontario. His conversion to deficit financing at the time of the
 global economic crisis was a deathbed one, at least in part dictated by
 the need to survive confidence votes in the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by that measure, Trudeau's Trans Mountain move is an outlier. The electoral math does not add up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the face of it, the 
prime minister has at best shored up half a dozen Liberal seats in the 
Prairies at the cost of potentially putting in play at least triple that
 number across the country. Along the way, Trudeau has put himself on a 
collision course with many Indigenous constituencies, and he has 
destroyed his international reputation as a climate change crusader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the stakes, the 
prime minister's pipeline gamble has even been compared to Brian 
Mulroney's decision to roll the dice in his relentless quest for 
constitutional reconciliation with Quebec in the early 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mulroney had a 
compelling incentive to stick with the constitutional file to the bitter
 end. After the Meech Lake accord failed, he could not have let it go 
without risking his governing majority as the result of defections to 
the nascent Bloc Québécois and without fuelling support for Quebec 
secession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is an economic case
 to be made for ensuring the Trans Mountain pipeline is completed. Of 
the projects designed to link the Alberta oilfields to tidewater that 
were on the drawing board when Trudeau became prime minister, it is the 
only one that is still actively pursued. Until the last B.C. election, 
it was also considered the most likely to get to completion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Trans Mountain 
expansion has also become as politically indispensable to Trudeau's 
agenda - at least in the mind of its Liberal overseers - as it may be to
 Canada's <b>oil</b> industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was always meant to be
 the poster project for the federal contention that it is possible to 
balance Canada's energy ambitions with a more aggressive approach to 
mitigating climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Trudeau came to 
power, the emphasis has been the part of the equation that involves 
putting a price on carbon pollution as a necessary step to earn a <b>social license</b> for a pipeline projects such as Trans Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Liberal government believes the flipside of the equation - that a <b>social license</b> for a carbon tax cannot be sustained if it is earned on the back of Alberta's energy industry - to be just as essential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allowing the Trans 
Mountain expansion to die this week would have cost Trudeau the support 
of Alberta's NDP government for his national climate change framework. 
Back in March, Premier Rachel Notley tied meeting Ottawa's carbon tax 
targets to the future of the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking to next year's 
federal election, the demise of the Trans Mountain expansion would have 
meant giving opponents of Trudeau's carbon pricing strategy - starting 
with the federal Conservatives - a prime exhibit in their prosecution of
 the havoc they argue his policy will wreak on the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As so it is that while 
Trudeau is widely portrayed as having picked the polluters' side in the 
climate change debate, the Liberals will argue that they have done what 
they needed to do to continue to advance a pro-environment agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only time will tell 
whether this government has trapped itself in an intricate web of 
twisted logic. If so, as of this week's Trans Mountain announcement 
Trudeau is unlikely to untangle himself from that web in time for next 
year's election.</p>

be built. If this approach works, at the end of their first term the

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bankers are also working on plans to help Trans Mountain win an elusive <b>social license</b> by selling the project to a consortium of public sector pension plans with solid environmental credentials, including the <span class="companylink">British Columbia Investment Management Corp</span>. It’s worth noting that the country’s biggest fund, the <span class="companylink">Canada Pension Plan Investment Board</span>, said on Tuesday that it is “not actively assessing an investment in the extension opportunity.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That language is telling. The message from CPPIB is: We’re not interested now, but call us when the noise dies down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bright minds on Bay Street are also working on solutions to the problems that drove away <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>. If First Nations groups are raising concerns about the pipeline, bring them in as co-owners, as <span class="companylink">Suncor Energy Inc</span>. did by partnering with the Fort McKay and Mikisew Cree First Nations on a recent $500-million investment in an Alberta <b>oil</b> storage facility. Canadian banks might be able to provide the financing to make those investments possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Infrastructure assets 
such as pipelines, and the dependable cash they kick off, are currently 
hot investments. If Mr. Trudeau can do as his grandfather did and build a
 business that supplies energy to customers who need ever-increasing 
amounts of fuel, Trans Mountain will have no shortage of buyers. But the
 government needs to reduce the risks before those investors emerge.</p>

 it wasn't so darn important to our city, there'd be some degree of smug
 satisfaction with the awkward position in which both the premier and 
prime minister now find themselves embroiled in with this whole pipeline
 brouhaha.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, it was Premier
 Rachel Notley, when ensconced in opposition with barely a thought of 
ever getting the top job, who would regale the then-ruling Tories about 
the urgent need to wean the province off the endless energy 
rollercoaster.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And
 it was Prime Minister Justin Trudeau who once campaigned on a platform 
promising Indigenous groups and environmentalists there'd be a new dawn 
in Canada under his steel-eyed steerage, which would ensure the age of 
dastardly Big <b>Oil</b> would melt faster than any 21st century Arctic glacier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, Notley is now 
desperately clinging to that same disparaged roller-coaster with a 
white-knuckled fervour unmatched in modern-day Alberta politics. If it 
doesn't quickly kick into gear and help reduce the recession still 
lingering in Calgary, then the only coasting her party will do is into 
the Prairie political history dustbin this time next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, those Grits in
 Ottawa might as well be wording a help wanted ad aimed at anyone with a
 big shovel and broad back daft enough to try their hand at building a 
pipeline in this hopelessly divided country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reap what you sow springs to mind at this complete and utter farce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley set the scene in the early days of her premiership with all that long-since ditched blather about <b>social license</b>.
 Believing that the rest of Canada consisted of scrupulously fair folk 
without an ounce of self-interest, we were treated to the strange 
spectacle of marauding bands of ardent light bulb changing missionaries 
saving us from environmental Armageddon whether we liked it or not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that was then; this 
is now. (Though, to be honest, I've not noticed any real change in my 
monthly power bill since getting the blessed bulbs, other than the 
notorious carbon charge.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certainly, there's been 
no change either among many in the rest of Canada, despite our 
self-imposed emissions cap and carbon levy. Yep, they're quietly 
continuing to enjoy the fruits of those extra taxes Alberta generates, 
while merrily complaining we're turning the planet into some big black 
blob.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there's the prime 
minister, who happily stuck a stake through Enbridge's planned 
$7.9-billion Northern Gateway pipeline to Kitimat in B.C., while 
allowing his government to disparage the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span> and let a bunch of loudmouths, grandstanders and liars destroy <span class="companylink">TransCanada Corp</span>.'s $16-billion Energy East project aimed at shipping Alberta crude to New Brunswick refineries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just like Notley, he believed in this <b>social license</b>
 silliness. In Trudeau's case, he no doubt expected the Trans Mountain 
pipeline expansion to get a relatively easy passage as a type of payback
 for his government's success in screwing up the other national pipeline
 projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As we all now know, it didn't quite work out that way. So now the federal government is on bended knee to <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>,
 promising no doubt some huge taxpayer-funded payoff if the company 
agrees to continue putting up with the relentless sticks and stones of 
protest in B.C. and actually completes the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if they pull out as 
they have threatened to do at the end of this month? Well, according to 
federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau, there are other outfits that 
could step in to finish the job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, pray tell, who could they be? Maybe Morneau is thinking of those experienced Canadian pipeline builders. Yes, <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> and Enbridge - the same ones the Grits skewered a year or so ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And what would their 
reaction be, we wonder? Hold on a moment, folks. Can anyone else hear a 
strange, almost maniacal laughter emanating from those downtown Calgary 
office towers? Chris Nelson is a Calgary writer.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY, Alberta, May 11, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <span class="companylink">Questerre Energy Corporation</span>
 (“Questerre” or the “Company”) (TSX:QEC) (OSE:QEC) reported today on 
its financial and operating results for the first quarter ended March 
31, 2018.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, President and Chief Executive Officer of Questerre, 
commented, “Our production and cash flow growth this quarter was 
primarily driven by the increased investment in Kakwa. Production from 
the joint venture acreage almost doubled from the first quarter of 2017.
 With additional drilling scheduled for later this summer at Kakwa, we 
could see production dip in the next few quarters before a further 
increase by year-end.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, “Through a 
recent partnership with an experienced Montney operator, we plan to 
develop our immediately offsetting acreage. We are looking forward to 
the results from the first well given the strong condensate rates and 
low acid gas from our adjacent producing wells.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Highlights</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Average daily production over 2,000 boe/d for the quarter</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Adjusted funds flow from operations more than doubled to $4.7 million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Questerre partners with experienced operator to develop Kakwa North acreage</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Questerre commissions integration study for Jordan <b>oil</b>
 shale project Commenting on Quebec, he noted, “We were encouraged by 
comments this May from the Minister of Environment noting that the 
Minister of Energy and Natural Resources will soon be tabling 
regulations for hydrocarbons. Once finalized, we will be meeting with 
the municipalities to secure the local acceptability we need. We are 
confident there is interest in our clean gas pilot and its environmental
 and economic benefits.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Updating developments on its project in Jordan, he further added, “During the quarter, we engaged <span class="companylink">Hatch Ltd</span>., a global engineering firm, to review the engineering and economics for our <b>oil</b>
 shale project in Jordan. The initial project will target production of 
approximately 50,000 bbls/d and will include the costs to upgrade the 
produced <b>oil</b> to diesel and gasoline. Once this study is 
completed, we plan to commission a more detailed pre-FEED study as we 
commence negotiations for a concession agreement.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result of the 
increased capital investment in Kakwa last year, the Company reported 
higher production volumes over prior periods. Production averaged 2,013 
boe/d for the quarter compared to 1,123 boe/d for the same period last 
year with Kakwa accounting for over three quarters of production during 
both periods. Gross revenue more than doubled to $9.54 million with 
higher production volumes benefitting from higher <b>oil</b> prices in 
the period. The higher revenue contributed to adjusted funds flow from 
operations of $4.65 million for the period compared to $1.41 million 
last year. The Company reported net income of $0.06 million for the 
current quarter compared to a loss of $0.52 million for the first 
quarter last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capital investment for 
the quarter focused almost exclusively on Kakwa and totaled $8.66 
million (2017: $5.32 million). The Company anticipates incremental 
investment at Kakwa in 2018 could be up to $21 million and include six 
(1.5 net) wells subject to the operator’s final plans and continued 
results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The term "adjusted funds 
flow from operations" is a non-IFRS measure. Please see the 
reconciliation elsewhere in this press release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questerre Energy Corporation</span> is 
leveraging its expertise gained through early exposure to shale and 
other non-conventional reservoirs. The Company has base production and 
reserves in the tight <b>oil</b> Bakken/Torquay of southeast 
Saskatchewan. It is bringing on production from its lands in the heart 
of the high-liquids Montney shale fairway. It is a leader on <b>social license</b> to operate issues for its Utica shale gas discovery in the St. Lawrence Lowlands, Quebec. It is pursuing <b>oil</b> shale projects with the aim of commercially developing these massive resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questerre is a believer that the future success of the <b>oil</b>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The liquefied natural gas
 industry that B.C.'s government has been courting would have to fit in 
with the province's tough new targets for reductions in greenhouse gases
 if it wants to do business in B.C., NDP Environment Minister George 
Heyman says.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're
 not creating a climateaction strategy around LNG," Mr. Heyman said in 
an interview on Tuesday. “We're creating a climate-action strategy, and 
LNG [proponents] and the measures they can take to show us what their 
final lowest emissions can be in an overall context of reduced industry 
emissions will fit and have to fit." The NDP this week committed to 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent in the next 12 years, 
with cuts going to 60 per cent by 2040. The province is already 
committed to 80-per-cent reductions by 2050.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics - including the B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Green caucus, which has 
been supporting the NDP government - are skeptical that the NDP can have
 a robust climate-change strategy and an LNG sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a trip to Asia 
earlier this year, Premier John Horgan met with backers of a proposed 
LNG facility for the B.C. coast, but said any such projects would have 
to be in sync with his government's climate-action plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Heyman echoed that on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We've said that's a condition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A condition is something you have to meet to proceed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Heyman said details of how it will all fit together will be worked out in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP will develop that
 plan for release in the fall aimed at reducing emissions from 
transportation and industry, each at around 39 per cent of emissions, 
and “very aggressively" in buildings and communities, which account for 
22 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he has been meeting with representatives of the forestry, <b>oil</b> and gas and other industries. “They understand their <b>social license</b> depends on being as low-carbon as possible," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Andrew Weaver, leader of the BC Greens, who has been critical of the 
NDP's interest in LNG to the point of musing about voting down the 
government on the issue, said on Tuesday that he still thinks it is 
impossible to meet the targets with a major LNG facility, but added, “It
 doesn't preclude smaller facilities from being introduced."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decade ago, the former 
BC Liberal government promised to cut emissions by 33 per cent by 2020, 
but announced, in 2015, that it could not hit that target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Heyman said the NDP 
hopes to do better than the Liberals by engaging the public and 
stakeholders on their goals, and plans on being accountable for the 
results. “We're going to not just talk about it and forget about it, but
 report on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are committed to meeting the targets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weaver said he knows 
the civil service has been looking at policy measures for years to reach
 the goal. “It's like buttons, knobs and switches. The appropriate 
buttons, knobs and switches that are going to be used will be put 
together in the coming months for a full package to be put together in 
the fall," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environmental groups 
responded to the NDP targets by suggesting on Tuesday that they hinge on
 a concerted, sustained, serious plan that will not include room for 
LNG.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement, the <span class="companylink">David Suzuki Foundation</span>
 said the government will have to act very quickly on such priority 
items as regulating and applying the carbon tax to methane emissions 
from the <b>oil</b>-and-gas sector and enacting a zero-emission vehicle standard like Quebec's to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Merran Smith, who was 
cochair of a climate solutions committee commissioned by former B.C. 
Liberal premier Christy Clark, on Tuesday commended the NDP for its 
measures, but noted that if the government plans to add LNG to the B.C. 
economy, other industries and consumers will have to cut even more 
carbon.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As
 a Canadian visiting Ottawa - in a nod to our selfie-friendly Prime 
Minister - have you ever taken a photo on Parliament Hill at the 
Centennial Flame? For shame. You might have missed the opportunity. The 
federal government has now taken its fine-toothed climate comb to that 
Centennial Flame by studying options to cut the natural gas and 
extinguish the flame to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. In the 
meantime, Ottawa is spending $20,000 tax dollars every year to purchase 
carbon offsets for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a bit silly. As the 
developing world is dramatically ramping up its demand for fossil fuels 
thanks to undeniably positive progress, Canada is looking at ways to 
turn a small flame into a LED light bulb.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's
 the latest move in the federal government's fourpronged climate plan: 
first, collect and spend more money; second, make life less enjoyable 
for Canadians; third, ensure politicians like Justin Trudeau and 
activists like David Suzuki carry on their carbon-intensive lifestyles; 
and fourth, look mildly ridiculous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If our politicians want 
to give the illusion that they're saving the planet with symbolic 
gestures, how about starting with themselves? Stop taking international 
flights to meetings discussing why people should take fewer 
international flights. Perhaps Face-Time the Aga Khan instead of flying 
all the way to his private island. Live a little less high on the hog. 
But their hypocrisy knows no bounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At present, Prime 
Minister Trudeau is still flying all over the world for luxury 
vacations. Minister of Environment and Climate Change Catherine McKenna 
tweets often about jetting off to climate meetings with groups of people
 who have evidently never heard of Skype. Carbon taxing premiers and 
provincial ministers are no better. And how many homes does Suzuki own? 
Politicians and bureaucrats are shuttled around using a lot of energy. 
Those trips are taxpayer-funded, so regular Canadians foot the bill 
twice - once on their own travel costs and again for the increased 
travel costs of the government class.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To what end? Those who 
supported Justin Trudeau's carbon tax schemes, hoping for tangible 
returns - via the intangible so-called <b>social license</b> - must 
surely be frustrated with the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain Pipeline 
expansion. The project got a technical go-ahead from the federal 
government a year and a half ago, yet is at a total stand-still. It 
failed to win <b>social license</b> with British Columbia gatekeepers, 
despite Albertans swallowing the carbon tax for nearly 18 months and the
 Trudeau government promising to punish all Canadians with the same tax 
grab.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Social license</b> has always been a false bill of goods, but it convinced some in the <b>oil</b>
 and gas industry that they first must be punished to achieve progress. 
(How's that working out?) Thankfully, fewer Canadians will be forced to 
stomach this political hypocrisy as the provincial defense against 
Trudeau's $35-billion annual carbon tax is mounting. Saskatchewan is 
taking the federal government to court and Manitoba's premier says he'll
 do the same, Atlantic provinces are not moving closer to carbon taxes, 
and polls show anti-carbon tax political leaders are likely to win the 
next elections in Ontario and Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign demand for fossil
 fuels makes carbon dioxide taxes here essentially pointless - unless 
you agree shipping jobs to China is a good way to lower Canada's CO2 
emissions. But if our politicians are so convinced that changing 
Canadian behaviour is the key to saving the world, the least they could 
do is lead by example. Until they do, their scolding will be 
hypocritical and their gestures will be silly at best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the day comes when the
 carbon tax is imposed on all Canadians by a heavyhanded federal 
government, take heart: together, we can gather 'round the Centennial 
LED, partaking collectively in one very long eye roll - or to ensure we 
keep warm, perhaps a louder political protest.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">HTC Purenergy Inc</span>. has released its audited financial results for the fiscal year ending Dec. 31, 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HTC Purenergy and its 
subsidiaries has chosen to refocus its business units in the 
Environmental Technologies Sector. The acceptance of climate change and 
the <b>social license</b> that corporations are moving towards, are upon
 us in force. Carbon footprint and the capture and management of CO2 has
 become effectively a currency of business, a vehicle for penalty and 
taxation, and a statement to shareholders who expect environmental 
responsibility from the companies they invest in. We note as well, that 
all segments of the energy sector must contribute and as such, the 
management of CO2 from combustion-fired plants, can be used not only to 
reduce emissions, but also to improve <b>oil</b> production, through the use of enhanced <b>oil</b>
 recovery ("EOR") techniques. HTC has focused its efforts in this area 
over the past few years, as EOR provides an immediate economic benefit 
to an <b>oil</b> company, in addition to being able to meet its <b>social license</b> responsibilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The natural gas industry 
has taken on a new challenge of gas cleanup of CO2, SO2 and other 
contaminants, while ensuring that the solvents and the glycols that are 
used in the clean-up process are recycled and reused, while at the same 
time providing a significant cost reduction to the customer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HTC's Delta Purification 
Division and HTC's investment in Clear Glycol &amp; Solvents Inc. are 
showing promising results, as the energy industry and many larger 
Industrial companies have joined the re3 revolution: reclaim, recycle, 
reuse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tertiary <b>oil</b> 
production business requires a significant amount of water for 
production of steam and at the same time a significant capital cost to 
install traditional heavy <b>oil</b> production technologies. The Assist
 Energy Solutions Corp.'s "SCV" technology allows the use of brackish 
production water, that normal ly would have to be disposed of or 
treated, to be used as steam for energy production. The SCV technology 
also allows the heavy <b>oil</b> producer to bring existing non-producing wells back online, with a minimal investment in capital costs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total assets for the 
Period were $27,222,061 compared to $29,839,303 as at December 31, 2016.
 The primary reasons for the change is attributable to ClearGSI 
conversion from consolidation to equity accounting, and the substantial 
increase in property, plant and equipment associated with the 
development of grain and fertilizer handling facility projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Current liabilities were 
$1,584,236 for the Year as compared to $3,142,192 as at Dec. 31, 2016. 
Decrease of $1,557,956 is largely due to the reduction in overall debt 
as a result of the disposition of Pinnacle and reduced ownership in 
ClearGSI requiring equity accounting in 2017. The decrease is also due 
to the making of regular repayments on the current portion of finance 
leases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenues for the Year of 
$269,493 reflect an increase of $207,188 from Dec. 31, 2016, due to an 
increase in sales that came from HTC's subsidiary Maxx Group of 
Companies Corp. and its subsidiaries (together "Maxx Group") of 
$102,570, $66,923 comes from HTC CO2 Systems Corp. (December 31, 2016 
$30,859) and $100,000 (December 31, 2016 - $31,446) came from 
engineering and process design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Corporation had a 
commercial operating loss at December 31, 2017 of ($4,339,892) as 
compared to ($3,892,106) for the period ending December 31, 2016 for a 
net change of $447,786. The change between December 31, 2017 and 
December 31, 2016 was due to an increase in financing costs arising on 
allocation to funds on receivables due over the next few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Costs of sales reflect 
manufacturing and sales costs associated with Maxx Group. The increase 
is a result of the costs associated with inventory sales. Engineering 
and process design services include costs associated with the provision 
of consulting services. There were $100,000 costs in engineering 
projects during the Period, (2016 - $31,446). These costs resulted from 
sales reported in quarter two. There is no three-month comparison for 
this period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amortization for the 
Period reported was $370,793 (December 31, 2016 $368,124). Amortization 
in the periods are comparable with the slight increase in amortization 
relating to capital purchases. Amortization relating to buildings have 
not begun as the grain and fertilizer handling projects are still in the
 development phase. Operations are expected to commence in 2018 subject 
to project completion, at which time amortization will commence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finance expenses realized
 during the Period was $425,610 (December 31, 2016 - $14,735). The 
increase is a result of computations of interest charges on amounts 
receivable over the next few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deferred tax recovery of $1,359,877 results in tax associated with the renegotiation of the terms of the sale of <span class="companylink">Nuvision</span> resulting in recognition of the gains the year and eliminate contingent amounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Net Income for the Period
 was $2,372,965 compared to income of $3,773,662 as at December 31, 2016
 (see table above). The decrease is primarily due to fewer gains on 
dispositions realized in 2017 versus 2016. Comprehensive income (loss) 
includes the unrealized gains and losses on investments classified as 
available for sale of $(250,408) (December 31, 2016 $227,745) and 
represents the net change in the carrying value of the investments to 
the quoted value and transfer of impaired investments to the 
Consolidated Statement of Loss. These adjustments do not involve cash. 
Comprehensive Income for the Period is $2,122,557 compared to income of 
$4,001,407 as at December 31, 2016. The decrease is attributable to net 
income and the change in unrealized gain on investments classified as 
available for sale.</p>

of those imports originating from the U.S. The importation of crude <b>oil</b>
 and bitumen advanced 15.4 per cent, with imported refined petroleum 
products up by 24.1 per cent, the latter due largely to increased 
imports of gasoline into British Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's increased importation of <b>oil</b> and its products reflects a growing trend in the past two years. In December 2015, the <span class="companylink">U.S. Congress</span> ended a 40-year ban on <b>oil</b> exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accompanied by surging U.S. production, crude <b>oil</b>
 exports from the U.S. to Canada (seasonally adjusted), have risen from 
$6.4 billion from September 2015 to February 2016, to $8.4 billion from 
September 2017 to February of this year, or by about a third.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While these numbers 
fluctuate monthly, the point is that in February, while Canada exported 
$8.8 billion in energy, it also imported $3.38 billion from 
international sources which, according to <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span>, represents a year-to-year increase of 12.3 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada produces far more <b>oil</b> than it can consume, and hence it is the world's fourth largest producer and third largest exporter of <b>oil</b>. In 2016, Canada was the largest foreign supplier of crude <b>oil</b> to the U.S., with 99 per cent of our <b>oil</b> exports directed there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada accounted for 41 per cent of total U.S. crude <b>oil</b> imports and 20 per cent of U.S. refinery crude <b>oil</b> intake. However, <span class="companylink">Natural Resources Canada</span> also indicated that in 2016, Canada imported crude <b>oil</b> and equivalents from many countries, including the United States (62 per cent), Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Nigeria and Norway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when Canadian 
attentions, both public and political, are riveted on our pernicious 
lack of pipeline access to international <b>oil</b> markets, we question why so little attention is being paid to Canada's increasing importation of petroleum products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It cost Canadians $3.4 
billion in February alone. To be clear, we are not arguing that a trade 
surplus or deficit is an appropriate barometer of a country's health. 
However, we do suggest that growing U.S. exports, due to deregulation, 
and our inability to build infrastructure to export our energy, is not 
beneficial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada could enhance its 
security of supply, reduce its trade deficit and produce fewer global 
greenhouse gas emissions if we used more of our Canadian crude <b>oil</b> production. A recent study by the <span class="companylink">Canadian Energy Research Institute</span>, using 2016 data, indicates that substituting Canadian <b>oil</b> wherever possible using space on existing pipelines, railcars and ocean tankers, could reduce foreign <b>oil</b> imports into Eastern Canada by a whopping 47 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This would save 
refineries $210 million and reduce Canadian emissions of carbon dioxide 
by the equivalent of more than two million tonnes, or about 5.7 per cent
 annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute also found that eastern Canadian refineries process just over one million barrels of <b>oil</b>
 per day, of which only 39 per cent originates from Western Canada and 
five per cent originates from the eastern Canadian offshore; fully 56 
per cent is imported from the United States (amounting to 260,000 
barrels of imported <b>oil</b> per day).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly, lower regulatory
 and fiscal costs would benefit all Canadians. Hence, we urgently need 
better policies to resolve our pipeline infrastructure problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a precarious B.C. government opposes <b>oil</b>
 pipelines, the Trudeau government's avowed transition away from fossil 
fuels appears to be directed solely at penalizing Canadian producers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is over-regulating
 domestic producers with misdirected policies that allow foreign 
petroleum imports - unimpeded by Canadian environmental laws, so-called <b>social license</b>,
 greenhouse gas reduction strategies and associated taxes - to flood 
into Canada to displace jobs and discourage investment. Ron Wallace has

 River-Westlock MP Arnold Viersen emphasized the need for more pipelines
 in the region, including around the Whitecourt area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pipelines are currently at maximum capacity in Alberta.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Pipelines
 are integral to the Canadian economy, but especially northern Alberta,"
 Viersen said. "Most of the petroleum products from Alberta are produced
 in northern Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It affects us immensely."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Viersen, alternatives for <b>oil</b>
 transportation such as railways should be ruled out due to the 
increased danger and inefficiency. Using railways also takes up space 
that could be used for other products, such as grain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's just very expensive to ship <b>oil</b> by other processes other than by pipelines," Viersen said. "When we already have a discounted <b>oil</b> price, to then have to put that extra cost on it just makes it a nonstarter for <b>oil</b> companies."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Viersen explained that less exploration leads to less people in the area, which negatively affects the local economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He noted that the region had a high of 1,800 drilling rigs in 2013, but now has only around half that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Just that alone means there's thousands of people not working," Viersen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> recently announced it 
would suspend work on the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion after 
pushback from British Columbia and environmental activists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Since Prime Minister 
Justin Trudeau has taken power, we've seen Northern Gateway get 
cancelled, we've seen the Energy East project get cancelled as well, and
 now we're look at Trans Mountain, which is probably the last major 
pipeline project that was in the cue," Viersen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also noted how the carbon tax was supposed to give Alberta "<b>social license</b>" for the building of more pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've been underneath 
the weight of a significant carbon tax before many of the other 
provinces and it doesn't seem to be helping," he said.</p>

conservatives, including himself, are now calling on Trudeau to take 
action and convince the opposition to allow more pipeline projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's his job to convince

 is not just pipelines that Canada has a hard time getting done. Putting
 money where the country's mouth is on climate change is turning out to 
be at least as hard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, two provinces 
turned to the courts to challenge core elements of Prime Minister Justin
 Trudeau's plan to reconcile Canada's energy ambitions with its 
climate-change obligations.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As
 previously announced, the government of British Columbia is asking that
 province's top court to clarify whether it has the constitutional 
authority to regulate the amount of bitumen <b>oil</b> that transits 
through its territory. The answer will not be forthcoming for a while 
and certainly not in time for the May 31 deadline set by <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> to fish or cut bait on its expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A favourable court ruling
 for B.C. could have consequences for the profitability of all future 
interprovincial pipelines, starting with the Trans Mountain expansion. 
In the immediate future, the move by the province's minority NDP 
government means that project will likely not go ahead without an 
injection of public funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If he loses the court 
battle, Premier John Horgan says he will consider the pipeline matter 
closed. But that might only happen once the province has exhausted all 
its legal recourses. If the case makes its way to the Supreme Court, 
this debate could stretch beyond the next B.C. election. The government 
of Saskatchewan has also gone to its top court to challenge the federal 
government - Trudeau's plan to impose a carbon tax on provinces that 
fail to take steps to meet the carbon-pricing threshold set by Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ontario and Alberta, 
the Conservative opposition parties support Saskatchewan's move. If 
elected to power later this spring and next year, Doug Ford and Jason 
Kenney have both said they would fight Trudeau's carbon-pricing policy 
in court. Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is planning to campaign next
 year on a promise to repeal the Liberal climate-change framework.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all the drama 
surrounding the battle to stop the Trans Mountain project, the political
 forces aligning against Trudeau's climate-change strategy are no less 
consequential. They are also just as uncompromising in their stance as 
the anti-pipeline foes, whose intractable opposition to the Trans 
Mountain project they so vehemently denounce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he set out the terms 
of his province's carbon tax challenge on Wednesday, Saskatchewan 
Premier Scott Moe argued that provinces are not subsidiaries of the 
federal government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent Supreme Court 
beer ruling demonstrated that contention has a constitutional 
foundation. But the irony that Saskatchewan is invoking the same 
federalism principle to fight Trudeau's carbon tax as B.C. is in its 
challenge to the federally backed pipeline is apparently lost on Moe and
 his federal and provincial allies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau came to power 
touting a two-pronged approach to energy and climate change. His 
government would put in place a national framework for carbon pricing 
and make a start toward meeting Canada's international obligations to 
reduce greenhouse gases. But it would also have the back of the fossil 
fuel industry as it sought to expand its reach to markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two-and-a-half years 
later, few of the protagonists in the debate have bought into Trudeau's 
proposed compromise, they have sidestepped it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notwithstanding the prime
 minister's carbon-pricing initiatives, climate change activists in B.C.
 and elsewhere and their like-minded Indigenous allies are not about to 
give a <b>social license</b> to pipeline projects. Opposition to the Trans Mountain expansion is more deeply rooted in concerns over the increased risk of <b>oil</b> spills at sea than in the project's contribution to greenhouse-gas emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other side of the 
debate, the Conservative opposition to Trudeau's carbon-pricing policy 
is not tied to the obstacles standing in the way of the Trans Mountain 
expansion. If those obstacles were removed tomorrow, Scheer, Ford, 
Kenney and Moe would not blink an eye in their battle against a federal 
carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Trudeau, winning the 
pipeline battle would not translate into winning the carbon-pricing war.
 It would only impose on his government an even greater obligation to 
ensure its carbon-pricing plan is equally implemented. The prime 
minister has said he will see the Trans Mountain project done, even if 
that means forcing the hand of B.C.'s government and losing support in 
B.C. before next year's federal election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By all indications, 
Trudeau will have to show the same determination to ensure his national 
climate change framework becomes a reality in every province - again, at
 some potential risk to his party's electoral fortunes.</p>

However, <span class="companylink">Natural Resources Canada</span> also indicated that in 2016, Canada imported crude <b>oil</b> and equivalents from many countries, including the United States (62 per cent), Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Nigeria and Norway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when Canadian 
attentions, both public and political, are riveted on our pernicious 
lack of pipeline access to international <b>oil</b> markets, we question why so little attention is being paid to Canada's increasing importation of petroleum products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It cost Canadians $3.4 
billion in February alone. To be clear, we are not arguing that a trade 
surplus or deficit is an appropriate barometer of a country's health. 
However, we do suggest that growing U.S. exports, due to deregulation, 
and our inability to build infrastructure to export our energy, is not 
beneficial to Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada could enhance its 
security of supply, reduce its trade deficit and produce fewer global 
greenhouse gas emissions if we used more of our Canadian crude <b>oil</b> production. A recent study by the <span class="companylink">Canadian Energy Research Institute</span>, using 2016 data, indicates that substituting Canadian <b>oil</b> wherever possible using space on existing pipelines, railcars and ocean tankers, could reduce foreign <b>oil</b> imports into Eastern Canada by a whopping 47 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This would save 
refineries $210 million and reduce Canadian emissions of carbon dioxide 
by the equivalent of more than two million tonnes, or about 5.7 per cent
 annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute also found that eastern Canadian refineries process just over one million barrels of <b>oil</b>
 per day, of which only 39 per cent originates from Western Canada and 
five per cent originates from the eastern Canadian offshore; fully 56 
per cent is imported from the United States (amounting to 260,000 
barrels of imported <b>oil</b> per day).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly, lower regulatory
 and fiscal costs would benefit all Canadians through the more efficient
 utilization of Canadian resources. Hence, we urgently need better 
policies to resolve our pipeline infrastructure problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a precarious B.C. government opposes <b>oil</b>
 pipelines, the Trudeau government's avowed transition away from fossil 
fuels appears perversely to be directed solely at penalizing Canadian 
producers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is over-regulating
 domestic producers with misdirected policies that allow foreign 
petroleum imports - unimpeded by Canadian environmental laws, so-called <b>social license</b>, greenhouse gas reduction strategies and associated taxes - to flood into Canada to displace jobs and discourage investment.</p>

 Daily Times -- The Trans Mountain Expansion pipeline has dominated news
 in the past few weeks. The public is divided over whether we should 
build this pipeline and allow Alberta <b>oil</b> sands output to increase, or whether it presents too much risk to BC's rivers and coastal environments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many experts described 
the original project approval process as deeply flawed. The Liberals 
ignored their campaign promise of a new, improved process and instead 
sent a ministerial panel along the pipeline route in the summer of 2016.
 Many communities and First Nations governments criticized this process 
as inadequate as well. However the panel did write a report that ended 
with a list of six clear questions for the government to answer before 
making a decision.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think it would be useful to review those questions to see more clearly how we got into this quagmire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Can construction of a 
new Trans Mountain Pipeline be reconciled with Canada's climate change 
commitments? Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr often proclaims "This 
pipeline will be built", but I have never heard him say "We will meet 
our Paris targets." For many pipeline opponents this is the crux of the 
problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. In the absence of a 
comprehensive national energy strategy, how can policy-makers 
effectively assess projects such as the Trans Mountain Pipeline? Canada 
needs a national energy strategy that would answer broader questions 
such as: what role new pipelines would play in a world where world <b>oil</b> demand (according to the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span> itself) will begin declining in 2019; how we might refine our <b>oil</b> resources for our own use rather than exporting bitumen and importing foreign <b>oil</b> on the Atlantic coast; and how we can create good jobs in renewable energy as the world shifts to a low carbon future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. How might Cabinet 
square approval of the Trans Mountain Pipeline with its commitment to 
reconciliation with First Nations and to the UNDRIP principles of "free,
 prior, and informed consent?" This is perhaps the key question that the
 federal government failed to answer before it approved the Trans 
Mountain Expansion. There is strong opposition to the project from many 
First Nations, and a number of lawsuits are in the courts arguing that 
the approval process did not involve proper consultation. If this is 
found to be the case (as it was in the Northern Gateway pipeline 
decision) it could delay the project another year or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. Given the changed 
economic and political circumstances, the perceived flaws in the NEB 
process, and also the criticism of the Ministerial Panel's own review, 
how can Canada be confident in its assessment of the project's economic 
rewards and risks? According to Nanos Research only 2% of Canadians have
 strong confidence in Canada's energy regulation system, a fact that 
bears on the discontent seen on both sides of this debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. If approved, what 
route would best serve aquifer, municipal, aquatic and marine safety? 
Kinder Morgan has not yet asked the government for approval of the exact
 route for much of the pipeline; in many cases the old route will not be
 followed, especially in the Lower Mainland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6. How does federal policy define the terms "<b>social license</b>"
 and "Canadian public interest" and their inter-relationships? Through 
the election campaign, Justin Trudeau repeated the mantra "governments 
can grant permits, but only communities grant permission". The federal 
government now finds itself in a very difficult situation, having to 
tell coastal British Columbians that the project is in the national 
interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is now too late to 
answer these questions before Kinder Morgan's self-imposed deadline of 
May 31, but we would have been in a much better situation had the 
government fully dealt with them before approving the Trans Mountain 
expansion project.</p>

<span class="companylink">Sherritt International Corporation</span> 
("Sherritt" or the "Corporation") (TSX: S), a world leader in the mining
 and hydrometallurgical refining of nickel and cobalt from lateritic 
ores, today reported its financial results for the first quarter ended 
March 31, 2018. All amounts are in Canadian currency unless noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CEO COMMENTARY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sherritt's results for 
Q1 reflect the positive impact of improving commodity prices and our 
continuing efforts to strengthen our balance sheet," said David Pathe, 
President and CEO of Sherritt International. "We ended the quarter with 
more cash on hand, less debt, and higher cash received from the Moa JV 
-- all clear signs of progress."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pathe added, "With 
production challenges at the Moa JV caused by excessive rainfall and 
rail transportation delays largely behind us, we are bullish about our 
prospects for the balance of 2018 given the favorable outlook for nickel
 and cobalt prices due to favorable demand trends, particularly within 
the electric vehicle battery market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q1 HIGHLIGHTS </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">   -- Average-realized prices at the Moa Joint Venture ("Moa JV") for nickel 
      improved 26% to $7.80 per pound while average-realized prices for cobalt 
      increased 100% to $48.47 per pound. 
 
   -- Sherritt ended the quarter with $237.3 million in cash, cash equivalents 
      and short-term investments, up from $203.0 million at December 31, 2017. 
 
   -- Sherritt strengthened its balance sheet by purchasing for cancellation 
      $121.2 million of outstanding debentures at an aggregate cost of $110.3 
      million through a modified Dutch auction tender offer. The transaction, 
      which was funded by a unit offering that generated net proceeds of 
      approximately $125 million, brings the total amount of indebtedness 
      eliminated by the Corporation over the past four years to approximately 
      $2 billion. 
 
   -- Received $16.0 million from the Moa JV as repayment on its working 
      capital facility and US$40.7 million in Cuban energy payments, lowering 
      overdue scheduled receivables to $126.7 million from $132.6 million at 
      year end 2017. 
 
   -- Net direct cash cost (NDCC)(1) at the Moa Joint Venture was US$2.06 per 
      pound of finished nickel sold, marking the fourth consecutive quarter 
      that the Moa JV is in the lowest cost quartile. 
   -- Sherritt's share of finished nickel production at the Moa JV was 2,854 
      tonnes in Q1 2018, down 26% from Q1 2017, while its share of finished 
      cobalt was 336 tonnes, down 23% from Q1 2017. Consistent with previous 
      disclosure, the decline in production in Q1 2018 was attributable to the 
      reduced availability of mixed sulphides due to the highest level of 
      rainfall at Moa's operations in more than 20 years and rail 
      transportation delays to the refinery in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta by 
      the rail service provider. Subsequent to quarter end, delays with rail 
      transportation service have largely been resolved and mixed sulphides 
      availability has been restored to normal levels. 
   -- Executed a three-year extension of the Puerto Escondido/Yumuri <b>oil</b> 
      production sharing contract to 2021. 
 
   -- Adjusted EBITDA was $36.4 million, relatively flat when compared to Q1 
      2017. Adjusted EBITDA in Q1 2018 reflected the impact of the 
      restructuring of the Ambatovy Joint Venture completed in December 2017 
      that reduced Sherritt's ownership interest from 40% to 12%. 
 
   -- Net loss for Q1 2018 was $0.6 million or $nil on a per share basis. In Q1 
      2017, net loss was $72.6 million or $0.25 per share. 
 
   -- Q1 results marked Sherritt's first full quarter of operations since its 
      ownership interest at Ambatovy was reduced to 12% as a result of the 
      Joint Venture restructuring completed in December 2017. </pre>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HIGHLIGHTS SUBSEQUENT TO QUARTER END </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">   -- Sherritt finalized the evaluation of available and proven technology to 
      complete drilling of the second well on Block 10 targeting the Lower 
      Veloz reservoir. A proven technology solution has been selected and will 
      be deployed when drilling is slated to resume in early July 2018. 
      Preliminary drilling results are expected in Q3 2018. Capital budgeted to 
      complete the drilling is expected to be approximately US$13 million. </pre>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">METAL MARKETS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nickel</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nickel prices continued 
to rally in Q1 2018, sustaining the momentum established in second half 
of 2017. The average reference price in Q1 2018 was US$6.03/lb, up 29% 
from US$4.66/lb in the first quarter of 2017. The average reference 
price for Q1 2018 marked the highest since Q1 2015 when it was 
US$6.50/lb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year-over-year price 
improvement was driven by a number of developments, Chief among them is 
the growing understanding of the important role that Class I nickel will
 play in the growing electric vehicle (EV) market. Class I nickel, along
 with cobalt, are key metals needed to manufacture EV batteries. Demand 
for Class I nickel and cobalt are expected to grow significantly 
beginning in 2019 when China expects to begin production quotas 
requiring that 10% of all vehicles manufactured be electric.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(MORE TO FOLLOW)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sherritt Reports First Quarter 2018 Results -2-</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in the nickel reference price was also driven by the decline in inventories. Combined <span class="companylink">LME</span>
 and SHFE nickel inventories at March 31 2018, declined to 367,694 
tonnes (from 410,828 tonnes) at the start of the year. A further decline
 in visible inventories is expected to sustain the price increase 
momentum through the end of 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond 2018, nickel 
supply deficits are expected to widen as stainless steel sector growth 
is expected to outpace nickel production. The supply deficit is expected
 to be exacerbated with the rise of the electric vehicle market and the 
need for Class I nickel for battery production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cobalt</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cobalt prices rose in Q1 
2018, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of higher reference 
prices. The average-reference price for Q1 2018 was US$39.01/lb, up 97% 
from US$19.80/lb for Q1 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The near doubling of 
cobalt prices over the past year is primarily linked to the growing 
strong demand emanating from the EV battery market. Higher cobalt prices
 were also driven by geopolitical and supply risk concerns given that 
the Democratic Republic of Congo is currently the world's largest source
 of cobalt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As cobalt prices have a 
limited impact on overall battery pack costs, high prices are not 
expected to cause supply-chain disruptions or delay EV market growth. As
 a result, the risk of cobalt substitution in EV battery production in 
the near term is relatively low given cobalt's unique energy 
transference properties. While battery manufacturers continue to explore
 alternatives to cobalt, the likely beneficiary of any substitution is 
expected to be Class I nickel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the cobalt 
market's limited size, significant product orders cause price surges. As
 end-users are trying to build cobalt positions or to secure long-term 
supply, spot metal availability is sporadic and prices are expected to 
remain elevated in the near term.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Moa JV produced 2,854
 tonnes of finished nickel in Q1 2018, down 26% from 3,840 tonnes 
produced in Q1 2017. Finished cobalt production in Q1 2018 was 336 
tonnes, down 23% from 436 tonnes produced in Q1 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The production decline in
 Q1 2018 was principally due to reduced availability of mixed sulphides 
caused by the highest level of rainfall at Moa's operations in more than
 20 years that limited access to planned mining areas as well as by 
transportation delays to the refinery by the rail service provider. The 
adverse impact of excessive rain fall and rail transportation delays 
have been alleviated since the start of the second quarter, and Sherritt
 expects to achieve the lower end of its 2018 production guidance for 
finished nickel and finished cobalt at the Moa JV. Second quarter 
production will be impacted, however, by the annual shutdown of the 
refinery in Fort Saskatchewan due to scheduled maintenance activities. 
This year's shutdown is expected to be similar in duration to prior 
years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q1 2018 revenue for the 
Moa JV and the Fort Site totaled $96.3 million, up 7% from $90.4 million
 for the comparable period of 2017. The growth was driven by higher 
realized prices in 2018 for nickel (+26%), cobalt (+100%) and fertilizer
 (+4%) although offset by lower sales volume and a higher Canadian 
dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nickel sales represented 
52% of total Q1 2018 revenue while cobalt sales represented 36%. 
Fertilizer sales in Q1 2018 were down 29% from last year, reflecting 
lower demand and timing of shipments ahead of the spring season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mining, processing and 
refining (MPR) costs for Q1 2018 were US$5.26 per pound, up 11% from 
US$4.75 per pound for Q1 2017. The increase was due to the impact of 
lower production as well to higher input costs, including increased 
sulphur and energy costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite higher energy and
 sulphur input costs and lower production, Moa's NDCC of US$2.06/lb for 
Q1 2018 was in the lowest cost quartile relative to other nickel 
producers, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of such distinction. 
NDCC in Q1 2018 declined by 37% compared to the prior year period, 
largely because of a higher cobalt by-product credit. The cobalt credit 
of US$4.27/lb reflects Moa's high cobalt to nickel production ratio as 
well as the 100% growth in cobalt prices since Q1 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given current commodity 
prices and the expected rate of production for the balance of the year, 
NDCC guidance at Moa for 2018 has been lowered to US$1.75/lb to 
US$2.25/lb from US$2.50/lb to US$3.00/lb of finished nickel previously 
announced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash provided by 
operations in Q1 2018 totaled $18.1 million, up 22% from $14.8, 
reflecting the year-over-year improvement in commodity prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moa's sustaining capital 
spending in Q1 2018 was $4.5 million, up from $2.1 million in Q1 last 
year. The increase was due to planned spending, including the start of 
work at a new slurry preparation plant dump pocket at Moa. The Moa JV is
 expected to continue to operate and fund capital expenditures through 
cash flow generated by the joint venture, or external loans.</p>

Sherritt Reports First Quarter 2018 Results -3-</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sherritt's financial 
results at Ambatovy are presented on a 12% basis for Q1 2018 and on a 
40% basis for Q1 2017. Production totals are presented on a 12% for both
 periods for better comparison purposes. Along with its partners, 
Sherritt completed the restructuring of the Ambatovy Joint Venture on 
December 11, 2017. The restructuring led to Sherritt's ownership 
interest being reduced to 12% in exchange for the elimination of $1.4 
billion of debt. Sherritt will continue to serve as operator of Ambatovy
 at least through 2024, however, as a result of the reduction in its 
ownership interest, Sherritt's ability to direct local decision-making 
at Ambatovy has diminished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On January 6, the 
operations of the Ambatovy Joint Venture were significantly impacted by 
Tropical Cyclone Ava, a Category 2 hurricane equivalent storm. The 
cyclone necessitated a plant shutdown and caused extensive damage to 
facilities and equipment. Production resumed at the end of January 
following the completion of critical repairs. Repairs to damage caused 
by Cyclone Ava are still ongoing. Metal production in Q1 2018 was also 
lower due to limited production of sulphuric acid as a result of a 
failed economizer in Acid Plant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consistent with previous 
disclosure, metal production at Ambatovy will continue to be constrained
 by lower production of sulphuric acid in Q2 2018. Lower production of 
sulphuric acid is due to the failed economizer in Acid Plant 1, which is
 currently operating at approximately 50% of capacity. Acid Plant 2 is 
operating at 100% capacity. Production capacity is expected to be back 
to normal once the economizer in Acid Plant 1 is replaced in May 2018. 
Replacement of the economizer will necessitate a shutdown of Acid Plant 1
 for approximately three weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finished nickel 
production at Ambatovy in Q1 2018 was 668 tonnes (12% basis), down from 
1,145 tonnes (12% basis) produced in Q1 2017. Finished cobalt production
 in Q1 2018 was 49 tonnes (12% basis), down from 97 tonnes (12% basis) 
for Q1 2017. The decline was principally due to the impact of Cyclone 
Ava and effects of the failed economizer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MPR costs for Q1 2017 
were US$7.90 per pound, up from US$5.53 per pound in Q1 2017. The 
year-over-year increase was largely due to the impact of lower 
production volumes in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NDCC for finished nickel 
at Ambatovy in Q1 2018 was US$5.34/lb, up from the US$3.93/lb for Q1 
2017. The increase was due to lower production, higher maintenance costs
 and higher energy and sulphur input costs offset by higher cobalt 
by-product credits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In light of current 
commodity prices and the expected rate of production for the balance of 
the year, NDCC guidance at Ambatovy for 2018 has been lowered to 
US$2.50/lb to US$3.00/lb from US$3.00/lb to US$3.50/lb of finished 
nickel previously announced.</p>

natural reservoir declines and the absence of new development drilling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue in Q1 2018 was

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime
 Minister Justin Trudeau is traveling through Europe this week, standing
 shoulder-to-shoulder with world leaders as he charmingly promotes 
Canada as a nation that is open for investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, we at home are
 left to muse about Trudeau's seeming inability to ensure that such 
opportunity truly exists in Canada and for Canadians.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite his many promises, Trudeau has done nothing to ensure the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 pipeline will become a reality. His unwillingness to take an 
authoritative and supportive stand behind the project now has investors 
in the $7.4-billion pipeline prepared to take their dollars elsewhere. 
Thousands of jobs, the viability of Alberta's economy and Canada's "open
 for business" status are all at stake, yet Trudeau appears content to 
remain on the sidelines as tensions rise across the country, with 
threats of interprovincial trade wars and constitutional challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years of careful reviews and innumerable environmental studies, the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>,
 the federal government and the prime minister all concluded that the 
pipeline is safe. Every court challenge has ruled in favour of the 
project going ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet noisy protestors have
 somehow managed to strip away the legitimacy of the authority that 
stands behind those decisions. They refuse to recognize the rule of law,
 in part because Trudeau himself has allowed them to become legitimate 
influencers of his energy policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2015, he said that pipelines were the most responsible way to get <b>oil</b> to markets, but then added that pipelines "have to achieve the public trust and the <b>social license</b> that is necessary." <b>Social license</b>? Cue the protestors. With that one comment, Trudeau has given them equal standing with facts, science and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau has long been a 
master of doublespeak, using his smile and adorable socks to take the 
edge off words that might offend. Even as he promises to build a 
pipeline, he has promised to "phase out" the oilsands (the very same 
oilsands for which he claims he is building the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline). He has said he is committed to moving <b>oil</b>
 out of Alberta, yet has sold his soul to the environmentalists with his
 unquestioning support for carbon taxes as a means of influencing 
climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunday's pipeline summit 
in Ottawa lasted just a couple of hours and proved to be just one more 
demonstration of Trudeau's inability to exert federal authority for a 
project that is, in his own words, "of vital strategic interest to 
Canada." He offered his usual prime ministerial promises to get the 
pipeline built and even vowed to invest Canadian dollars as a surety of 
his government's support. In doing so, Trudeau played the kind of 
politics that Canadians most loathe - throwing taxpayer money at a 
problem that could (and should) have been handled previously and sans 
lucre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, Trudeau did 
nothing to reduce interprovincial tensions. Alberta Premier Rachel 
Notley has since introduced legislation to stop the flow of <b>oil</b> 
to B.C., while Premier John Horgan has vowed to continue to resist just 
so he can stay in power. Saskatchewan and Quebec are now getting 
involved and investigating possible actions in support of Alberta and 
B.C., respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The whole country seems on the cusp of a crisis. Well done, Mr. Trudeau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, when a 
Vancouver Sun online poll asked readers if they were surprised by the 
outcome of the so-called pipeline summit, 80 per cent agreed with the 
comment, "No, this is exactly how I thought it would play out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not exactly support 
for Trudeau as a man of action. Rather, it's confirmation that Trudeau 
has played both sides of this debate for too long - neither side sees 
him as able to restore federal authority over the provinces or provide 
the necessary support for a megaproject of vital interest to Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Lead, follow, or get out of the way." It's a basic axiom for successful leadership. Mr. Trudeau would do well to consider it.</p>

 SOLOMON: Welcome back to "Question Period". Well, the stakes could not 
be higher. The prime minister is, right now, in an emergency meeting 
with the premiers of BC and Alberta. He's clearly desperate to emerge 
with a way to get the Trans Mountain pipeline built. Earlier in the 
program, the natural resource minister, Jim Carr, strongly hinted that 
the government will financially support the pipeline, so <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 doesn't pull the plug on it before their May 31st deadline. Clearly 
though, BC opposes it. And Alberta's ready to start a trade war over it.
 What does the prime minister have to deliver today? We're waiting for 
them all to emerge from this meeting. So, it could happen at any moment,
 and we'll go live to that, but the scrum is here waiting for that. 
Laura Stone, reporter with the Globe and Mail is here; Craig Oliver, 
CTV's chief political commentator is here; and Bob Fife, the Globe and 
Mail's Ottawa bureau chief is here. Look, we don't know. At any moment, 
they could emerge. We're expecting, actually, the BC premier, Mr. 
Horgan, to emerge first. I don't know, he seems intractable. Bob, what 
are you expecting the government to emerge from this meeting with?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ROBERT FIFE (The Globe 
and Mail): Well, federal officials are saying they did not expect any 
kind of significant movement from Premier Horgan on that. So they 
already have their game plan. Their game plan, as one official said to 
me, the main objective is to remove during the period of construction, 
the risk that the company can't or won't do. And so what we're going to 
expect later today when the prime minister makes an announcement, I 
think, around 1:00 o'clock, he will announce that Finance Minister Bill 
Morneau will now open discussions with the company on a number of 
options. One of them is, do you take an equity stake in this? Or do we 
provide some kind of risk insurance? There are other options. A big 
trigger is, do they expropriate the pipeline route? That's probably 
going to be mentioned in that meeting, which may give heart palpitations
 to Premier Horgan. Whether we'll actually go that route, I don't know. 
And they will certainly be told with, raise the issue of let's take this
 to the Supreme Court. The feds have already done their homework on 
that. They do not believe that the court would see this as an emergency,
 and besides that, it would take twelve to eighteen months for a court 
to make that kind of hearing, and we have the deadline marching on to 
May 31st.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: All right. 
Likely financial backing, likely invoking what's called expropriation, 
which means the government can just expropriate the land, and that's a 
flexing of federal jurisdiction muscles. Sources also telling me, don't 
expect a firm detailed plan financially. It's not like Bill Morneau and 
the prime minister are going to come out and say we're buying this 
pipeline. They are going to outline a process to get there. So, I would 
not look for details. That's what I'm hearing right now. Laura?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAURA STONE (The Globe 
and Mail): I think it's four against one in that room, in the prime 
minister's office, right now, on Parliament Hill. There is immense 
pressure on John Horgan to save face, and I think that the message to 
him is how little do you want to be humiliated in this fight? They're 
going to try to paint him as extremely unreasonable on this. The prime 
minister is going to come out with all the environment protections that 
they've given to the oceans. That's going to be a big focus of his media
 availability today, I suspect. And so the message in there, I think why
 they're going so long is they're trying to pitch to John Horgan, how 
can you get out of this alive, because they know he's not going to 
change his mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Craig?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CRAIG OLIVER (<span class="companylink">CTV</span>
 News): Well, for Alberta, this is really the last chance saloon. I 
mean, that's what's at stake here. They will never have another chance, 
probably, to get Alberta <b>oil</b> to Canadian tidewater. The country 
has a lot to lose here, too, many will, many will say. I think this 
meeting will come out, if Bob is right, and he always is, with all sides
 having taken a decision, say good-bye to the great old Canadian 
compromise. They will have been taken an irreconcilable position from 
which they cannot retreat. The question is, is it going to be enough for
 <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Right. Here's 
what we, we do expect Premier Horgan to be the first one out of this 
meeting. We'll take it live. Just expect him to say he is not giving an 
inch. There's no indication, and the federal government sources have 
told all of us this, that Horgan will give an inch. For him, Bob, is 
this all just political theatre? He's got to show his constituency, 
which is the Green party, I ain't going to be bullied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FIFE: Well, what he is, really, is the puppet of the Green leader in BC, who is really, he's, he's the guy who's...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Andrew Weaver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FIFE: Andrew Weaver's the
 man who's making this guy go up and down. Mr. Trudeau had tried, early 
on, to work with Premier Horgan. He said, in privately, to him, look, 
let's, we've got to get this pipeline built. Ask me what concessions you
 want. You come out. I'll say, oh, I had to give into these things. 
It'll make you look good. And he wouldn't do so. And so they don't 
really trust this guy anymore, because they've given him some options, 
and he doesn't want to play. And he doesn't want to play because he 
doesn't want to lose his government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: I'll tell you 
now, now, Laura, you said it's four against one, because the finance 
minister, the natural resource minister, Jim Carr, the prime minister 
are all in the room with Rachel Notley and Premier Horgan. I'll tell 
who's not in the room? There is no First Nations representative. And we 
spoke to the national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, Perry 
Bellegarde, about this. And they are livid that they have been excluded 
from this summit. Here's what Perry Bellegarde said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NATIONAL CHIEF PERRY BELLEGARDE (<span class="companylink">Assembly of First Nations</span>):
 I think it's a very big miss for the government. You've got the federal
 crown. You've got the provincial crowns. You're missing out the rights 
and titleholders. And that's the most important element. We have the 
right to self-determination. The rights and titleholders have to be 
involved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Okay, Perry Bellegarde saying it's a big mistake. How big a mistake?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STONE: This is a huge 
oversight on the part of the federal government. How can they say that 
they're negotiating in good faith with First Nations when you hold this 
extremely important meeting on Parliament Hill, and you exclude a voice 
from that community? I'm very shocked, in fact. I think it just shows 
how quickly this whole meeting was slapped together, as the prime 
minister was taking off for Peru. So, I think it's a big oversight, and 
it's going to do damage, I believe, to their reconciliation agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: I'm not so sure that it is that big a mistake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STONE: Oh, Craig...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: An awful lot of First Nations don't agree with the coastal chiefs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STONE: But that doesn't mean they have to be against it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: And furthermore, 
if they're there, why are they there? Are they there, is that suggesting
 that they have a veto over resource development? And that's a huge 
issue. The Supreme Court has never said they do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STONE: Well, it says they have a voice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: But Perry...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: So, are they there just to listen? That's not power. This is a time for political decision-making.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Perry Bellegarde
 said that First Nations, of course, are divided on this, as many other 
Canadians are. But this was the most important file for Justin Trudeau. 
To exclude a First Nations voice there, and Perry Bellegarde...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FIFE: Well, you know, I disagree with Laura, as well because that's not the place for the <span class="companylink">Assembly of First Nations</span>
 to be dealing with the provincial government, dealing with two resource
 issues. And I'll tell you the other thing, who does Perry Bellegarde 
speak for? There are 600 status bands that he represents, and they are

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STONE: And it doesn't 
mean it's in opposition. It's representing all the diverse views. It 
doesn't mean he's going to go and say we want to stop the pipeline, but 
he could present the different points of view of First Nations that he 
represents. Of course, it's on everyone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Perry 
Bellegarde, Perry Bellegarde was adamant. He said that pipeline, without
 First Nations, cannot be built. And when they're not there, the optics,
 I think, are very bad for that. And I think that, that could be very 
damaging. And I wonder, Craig, if that leads to very big protests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: This will be, if 
this pipeline goes ahead, it will be the biggest example of civil 
disobedience in Canadian history. It will be violent. It will be massive
 law breaking. Remember, Clayoquot Sound in 1993, 900 people went to 
jail. But that was way out in the woods. Nobody could get there. This is
 downtown Vancouver. It will be ugly and the prime minister will be seen
 to be behind those bulldozers and the people in front of the bulldozers
 will be the people who, for years, have been his biggest supporters. 
Indigenous people and environmentalists. It will be a mess for Trudeau.</p>

They're still in the meeting right now. We don't expect Horgan to have a

JUSTIN TRUDEAU (Canadian Prime Minister): The question is not whether 
the pipeline is going to get built. The question is how the pipeline 
gets built. And we are looking at all options.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON:
 Well the stakes could not be higher for the prime minister today. 
Rushing back from the conference in Peru, Justin Trudeau is now hosting 
an urgent meeting with the premiers of BC and Alberta to try to find a 
way to make sure the Trans Mountain pipeline is going to get built. But 
the company, the proponent, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>,
 they own the pipeline, they've set a deadline, get this going before 
May 31st or we will kill it. Now we just heard from the minister of 
natural resources, Jim Carr, tell us that the government is ready to do 
everything they can to make sure the pipeline gets built. He used the 
word de-risk, which might mean paying for it. Is that enough? Joining us
 from Calgary, Conservative MP Michelle Rempel; and in Victoria, we're 
joined by the NDP MP Murray Rankin. Great to have both of you here. 
Michelle Rempel, let me start with you. What more do you think the 
government can do to make sure this pipeline gets built?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MICHELLE REMPEL 
(Conservative – Alberta): They can invoke section 92.10 C of the 
Constitution Act to ensure that any remaining issues that have 
provincial jurisdiction fall into federal purview. They can make sure 
that any court cases that Premier Horgan might put forward to try and 
delay the pipeline becomes directly referred to the Supreme Court. They 
can scrap Bill C-69 which the pipeline association has said if this bill
 goes through there will be no more pipelines built in Canada. They can 
enforce the rule of law in terms of protests. You know, I could go on 
and on. The thing that you just said, de-risk, this is what Jim Carr 
just said to you. They want to use taxpayer dollars to, I'm assuming it 
will be like a guarantee or something, Evan, all they want to do is kick
 this down the road past the election so that their BC Liberal MPs can 
get re-elected. So when you think about that, when you think about the 
fact that they ask Canadians to pay a carbon tax to get <b>social license</b>
 to get this built, which it didn't, and now they want federal tax 
dollars to de-risk it for them. This isn't about de-risking it for <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 or for energy sector workers, this is about politically de-risking it 
in the hopes that it will die somewhere after the election. And that is 
disgusting, and every Canadian, regardless of what side of the pipeline 
debate they're on, should be holding the government to attack. It's just
 fekless arrogance. It's disgusting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Okay, strong 
words there. They say they're trying to de-risk it, Murray Rankin. In 
other words, to try to get out of this May 31st deadline in some way, 
and support Rachel Notley's idea of investing in the pipeline. What's 
your view of what they're doing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MURRAY RANKIN (NDP – BC):
 Well, first of all, May 31st is a deadline set by a Houston-based 
company. Since when do allow American companies to tell us what to do in
 Canada? We have a federal government. We have provincial governments 
that do that. We wouldn't be in this mess, as you know, I think, if it 
weren't for the fact that Mr. Trudeau came to my riding of Victoria in 
the election when he was a candidate and said, you know, we're going to 
redo this whole process, and look at how diluted bitumen performs in 
marine environment, get First Nations better involved, etcetera. They 
didn't do any of that. Now we are faced with two things. We're faced 
with massive opposition to this on our coast, and we're faced with a 
provincial government of Mr. Horgan that has a strong mandate from the 
people to oppose the risk, to deal with the risks that this pipeline is 
going to create.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Now this 
meeting, this summit, Michelle Rempel, he's have got Rachel Notley in a 
room, and he's got Mr. Premier Horgan in the room, and he's got to come 
up with something. Horgan's political life depends on opposing this. 
He's in a coalition with the Green Party. They don't want the pipeline. 
They're trying to either, "A", delay it to death, they don't want to do 
it. They say they have jurisdiction over the environment. What does 
Justin Trudeau have to say to Premier Horgan right now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: Find his spine 
and be the prime minister of Canada. This is a project that's in the 
national interest that passed one of the most rigorous environmental 
review processes in the world. We are not talking with Venezuela or 
Saudi Arabia. And, you know, Murray's comment about we won't let 
Houston-based organizations tell us where to go, that organization is 
about to put $7.4 billion into the Canadian economy. And, frankly, how 
much money have American environmental NGOs put into the opposition of 
this pipe pipeline? So I find it a little rich that an NDP MP, who many 
organizations that are funding the anti-pipeline protests have money 
from outside of the country. To me this is about a project that unites 
the country. I mean I have a lot of respect for Murray. The reality is, 
though, is that this isn't just about British Columbia, this isn't about
 Alberta. This is a project that's in the national interest. To me, this
 is, it's mindboggling that Trudeau won't just come out and say there 
are five or six things that need to be done. Bailing out this project 
will not do those things. He has to get those things done first. And I 
just, you know, it's very frustrating. RANKIN: Evan, I respect Michelle 
enormously, but we're proud Canadians on the west coast too, and I 
resent this notion that Mr. Trudeau is brandishing the term the national
 interest around as if somehow be standing up for our oceans, standing 
with First Nations, standing in favour of endangered killer whales, that
 somehow we're less Canadian. I resent that implication tremendously. 
People out here are proud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Mr. Rankin, just
 to be fair, the term national interest is a legal term of what's in 
the, to invoke what's in the national interest and the federal 
jurisdiction. But let me just try to understand, just a second. Let me 
just, and you're a lawyer, so you know this, I'm trying to appreciate 
the NDP's position. Your leader, Jagmeet Singh, says he doesn't support 
the pipeline, but then he says he wants to go to court to try to 
understand if the government, the federal government has the 
jurisdiction to build it. My question to you, if the courts decide, if 
it went to court, that the government does have the jurisdiction, would 
he flip his support and suddenly the federal NDP would support this 
pipeline?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RANKIN: His position has been I thought constructive to try to suggest that we have a reference to the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>, which we can do very quickly with the support of the government of British Columbia, the <span class="companylink">government of Canada</span>,
 perhaps First Nations, perhaps Alberta. We can go and get a quick 
ruling on whether or not British Columbia's jurisdiction over air, land,
 and water, which all provinces have, give it some ability to stop this 
project, or at least to have a change in regulations at the provincial 
level to address the legitimate concerns that a province like British 
Columbia has. Now if the court comes up with a clear statement that, no,
 British Columbia, you have no jurisdiction at all in the face of a 
federal undertaking, then of course we believe in the rule of law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Okay, so then 
you would support, that's interesting. So then Mr. Singh would say, yes,
 I support the pipeline. I just want to get that clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RANKIN: He would, he's a 
lawyer. He understands that the court has spoken. Now whether or not 
there are other issues that need to be addressed outside of the legal 
process is another thing. But you're asking what that would mean in 
terms of a legal argument, of course he would have to abide and accept 
the judgment of the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Michelle Rempel?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: What you have 
here, Evan, is you've got two political parties that do not want this 
pipeline built. So what we have seen over the last 10 years is these two
 political parties use the environmental review process to put in place 
uncertainty with the hope that these projects will just die or go away 
without them having to make the political decision, or the words coming 
out of their mouth we do not want this pipeline built. And that's what 
Murray just danced around. This is really the shamefulness of this. I 
would actually, I would rather have the discussion where, you know, I 
remember sitting with an NDP candidate during the election on national 
TV where she just said, you know, <b>oil</b> should stay in the ground. I would rather have that debate than the sort of...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RANKIN: We're not talking about that. That is not our position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: Yeah, but we are. We are. That is where the...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RANKIN: No. Absolutely 
not! REMPEL: That is where, that's where the debate is at right now. So 
why should we raise taxpayer resources guaranteeing things, tying up the
 court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RANKIN: Well the debate is Mr. Carr is talking about de-risking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: De-risking for who? For politicians!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RANKIN: Yeah, exactly. Exactly! What does that do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: This just needs to get built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RANKIN: What does that 
do? What does the ownership of part of this pipeline by the governments 
of Alberta and Canada have to do the legal jurisdiction at all? Nothing!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> didn't ask for the nationalization. <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 did not ask for the nationalization of energy infrastructure. And 
frankly the last time a socialist nationalized Canada's energy industry,
 it didn't go so well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Okay. I got to 
leave it there, Murray Rankin and Michelle Rempel. We'll find out more 
today what does happen. Thanks so much for joining us. Coming up, after 
the missile strikes in Syria, what is next? Was it really mission 
accomplished, or is the situation about to spin out of control? Retired 
Major General Dave Fraser and Canada's former top spy Dick Fadden are 
here next. Stay right here with "Question Period".</p>

 investors spooked by the uncertainty plaguing the planned Trans 
Mountain pipeline expansion, Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr said 
Friday as a high-level, make-or-break meeting loomed on the horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government is still 
examining its options, Carr said, but won't commit to a course of action
 before Sunday, when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau jets home from Peru 
for a hastily organized meeting in Ottawa with British Columbia Premier 
John Horgan and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What
 we're now faced with is to find ways to make sure there is more 
certainty than there is now," Carr said in an interview with The <span class="companylink">Canadian Press</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One of the ways to make 
sure there is more certainty is to look at possible financial 
arrangements that would help de-risk the project."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pipeline builder Kinder 
Morgan has halted all non-essential spending on the project until it 
gets assurances from Ottawa that the issues will be resolved. The 
federal government has until May 31 to respond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau has put a lot of 
political eggs in the Trans Mountain basket, risking political capital 
among climate-change activists in search of middle ground that allows 
for pipeline construction alongside improved <span class="companylink">environmental safeguards</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau, who is currently
 in Peru for the Summit of the Americas, was originally supposed to fly 
to Paris directly from Lima on Sunday for meetings with French President
 Emmanuel Macron. Instead, he'll be back in the national capital in 
search of a resolution to an intractable — and politically perilous — 
dispute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carr refused to discuss 
the specific financial options available, other than to say there are 
many of them on the table and they're all being considered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of those options, 
however, is to buy a stake in the pipeline, something Notley has already
 said Alberta would be willing to do. Canada and Alberta could jointly 
buy the pipeline outright, or at least a significant stake in the 
project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another option is to 
provide a guaranteed source of revenue for private investors if the 
pipeline completion date misses the target for when returns on their 
investments were supposed to start flowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company had targeted 
May 31 as the make-or-break deadline to start construction if the 
pipeline was to hit those investment targets. That date is now the 
drop-dead date <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> has given Canada to prove the company should have the confidence to move forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Political strategist 
Robin Sears, a principal at Earnscliffe Strategy Group, said another 
option would be to increase spending on the environmental protection 
side, including on improved research into preventing and mitigating the 
impacts of a diluted bitumen spill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The company has not done
 what it needs to have done to satisfy the people of B.C. they have 
taken the steps necessary to protect the environment," said <span class="companylink">Sears</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sears said the Trudeau 
government has an oceans protection plan on paper, but hasn't done much 
if anything to put it into action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carr was only prepared to
 say Sunday's meeting between Trudeau and the premiers would be a chance
 for the various sides to share their positions and try and talk things 
out — not necessarily a day when further action would be announced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, said <span class="companylink">Sears</span>, would be a bad political move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If they come out of that
 meeting on Sunday and (Trudeau) says, 'We've made good progress and I'm
 off to Paris,' it will cost them severely," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">University of British 
Columbia politics professor Kathryn Harrison said she doesn't know that 
there is a way for everyone to come out of Sunday's meeting with a win.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They have drawn lines in the sand that are simply incompatible," said Harrison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau and Carr have 
spent more than two years accusing the former Conservative government of
 themselves failing to build pipelines because they stacked the deck 
against environmental concerns, failing in the process to get the <b>social license</b> necessary to allow the projects to proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals introduced 
new review processes that accounted for things like the potential 
greenhouse gas emissions resulting from increased <b>oil</b> flows. The <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>'s 2016 approval of Trans Mountain required monitoring and upstream emissions offsets related to construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But environmental 
concerns remain — including the risk of higher emissions from increased 
oilsands production and the environmental impact of a spill. As a 
result, environmentalists who helped get Trudeau elected are now 
doubting his commitment to the cause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harrison said Trudeau has
 staked a claim on being able to reconcile both interests, offering up 
the pipeline — and the resulting ability to get resources to market — as
 a quid pro quo to get provincial and stakeholder support for a carbon 
price and environmental investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That was the compromise 
and they got pretty far with it," Harrison said, noting all provinces 
but Saskatchewan signed onto the climate change framework.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're at that point now 
where the trains are colliding. This is a moment of truth for Canada and
 a country that relies heavily on producing fossil fuels."</p>

built, but if the company building it is now wavering, and the Green 
party dependent NDP premier of the province through which it must pass 
hasn't yet found a body he won't chuck in front of it, at what point do 
you call a spade no spade and concede the Earth will not be moving?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps fearing for its economic and constitutional credibility, the answer from Team Trudeau is a ringing "not now, not ever."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are determined to see
 (Trans Mountain) built," Trudeau has told reporters. "It is in the 
national interest. It doesn't make any sense for us to continue to have a
 $15-billion discount on our <b>oil</b> resources because we are trapped with an American market. We need to get our resources to new markets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed. The same words could have - and did - come out of Stephen Harper's mouth. Trudeau now has to bell the cat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Green Party Leader Elizabeth May, centre, is arrested by RCMP officers after joining protesters outside <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s facility in Burnaby, B.C., on March 23, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't meant to be 
this way. Harper's confrontational "cram-them-down-your-throats" 
pipeline policy was to be replaced with Trudeau's more charismatic 
approach that would accrue the "<b>social license</b>" needed to grease 
construction, a canard that happens to be, despite the environmental 
hysteria, the only fauna killed to date along the pipeline's route.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To frame the debate as pro-economy versus pro-environment is to miss the point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Trans Mountain 
ultimately proves is the past 20 years of debate in Canada has split 
people into two irreconcilable camps: pro-<b>oil</b> and anti-<b>oil</b>. Preening at climate summits and taxing carbon won't make exporting <b>oil</b>
 kosher to those who are resolutely opposed. Over their dead bodies is 
the message being passed to Trudeau at the minute. It's not a question 
of law, it's a matter of will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Giddy though the 
opposition parties might be, now is not the time for them to revel in 
Trudeau's mire. Seeing your opponent hoist with his own petard is 
satisfying, but if the pipeline really is in Canada's national interest -
 and it is - the opposition should offer some constructive suggestions 
along with any withering scorn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the rather shouty and petty state of modern politics, this won't happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The partisan urge to 
nanny-nanny-boo-boo is too strong and besides, Conservatives will say, 
the Liberals didn't exactly lift a finger of support in opposition 
before assuming office and turning the matter into a constitutional 
crisis. Further disincentivizing bipartisan efforts is the Trudeau 
carbon tax, a big part of the government's <b>social license</b> play that is not particularly well-read by any capital-C Conservative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Alberta Premier Rachel Notley talks to cabinet members about the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline expansion, in Edmonton on Monday, April 9, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here, Trudeau shoulders a
 good chunk of the blame. For all his talk of kumbaya, Trudeau's Pan 
Canadian Framework for Clean Energy and Climate Change - with its plan 
for carbon "pricing" - was effectively crammed down provincial throats. 
And with Rachel Notley and Kathleen Wynne's governments now in severe 
financial distress, voters there and across Canada will surely begin to 
wonder why the hell they're on the road to higher taxes if those uppity 
British Columbians aren't holding up their end of the <b>social-license</b> bargain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is where federal NDP
 leader Jagmeet Singh should have a useful intervention to make, given 
it's his provincial brethren on opposite sides of the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 dispute. But to hope for substance from Singh is to wish for unicorns. 
Singh has done the easy thing and sided with B.C. and its brighter 
federal electoral prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where does this leave Trans Mountain? Shorn of friends and solutions, but all is not yet lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government can, and 
should, re-assert its constitutional right to build the pipeline. And 
yes, the feds can join Alberta in slapping down money and insurance 
guarantees. But that's only half the battle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Protesters chant as they wait for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's arrival to meet with members of the <span class="companylink">Canadian Coast Guard</span> to discuss marine safety and spill prevention, in Victoria on Thursday, April 5, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the communities along 
the pipeline route remain ready to obstruct its construction it's going 
to take a lot more than bucks and words to clear the way. Even the stern
 words of a judge urging protesters out of the way might not do the 
trick. What then?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do the sunny ways of Trudeau the son even allow for a hint of the army steel flashed by his father? Do we just ... watch him?</p>

 who have grown increasingly concerned about the barriers facing 
Canada's energy industry have even more reason to despair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's well known that 
Canada's regulatory environment is among the most robust in the world, 
ensuring the highest regard for the environment, including limiting 
greenhouse gas emissions. In recent years, Alberta has imposed a carbon 
tax and capped oilsands emissions in the naive hope of securing 
so-called <b>social license</b> for pipeline development. Everyone knows how that has turned out.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An
 ocean away, the United Nations body that regulates the international 
shipping industry is meeting in London this week to see if it can agree 
on a strategy to reduce emissions from the cargo ships, <b>oil</b> 
tankers and other vessels that traverse the planet's oceans. This is 
serious work, because such emissions were excluded from the Paris 
Climate Agreement in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This means that when Eastern Canada buys its fuel from countries such as Saudi Arabia, Azerbaijan, Nigeria and Angola, the <b>oil</b> isn't just produced using less rigorous environmental standards than those in Canada. It also means the <b>oil</b> tankers that transport foreign <b>oil</b> to our shores aren't subjected to controls on their greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">UN</span>'s <span class="companylink">International Maritime Organization</span> says such vessels risk becoming the singlelargest source of planet-warming greenhouse gases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet Eastern Canadians welcome the tankers with open arms, while vehemently opposing Canadian pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If action isn't taken, 
the organization says emissions from shipping could grow by up to 250 
per cent by 2050. International shipping emissions are not assigned to 
any one country, according to The <span class="companylink">Canadian Press</span>,
 but on their own, they are higher than the total emissions from all but
 the six biggest national emitters - China, the United States, India, 
Russia, Japan and Germany.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's an indignity that 
Albertans and their economy have been placed in a straitjacket for no 
apparent purpose by Premier Rachel Notley and Prime Minister Justin 
Trudeau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government 
even changed the rules recently to require future pipeline projects to 
calculate the upstream and downstream environmental emissions - which is
 pollution produced during extraction and when the fuel is burned in 
vehicles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No such burden is placed on Eastern Canadian carmakers or plane manufacturers, of course. Or on ships that deliver foreign <b>oil</b> to Eastern ports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta is being unfairly treated.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunday, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada</span> announced its halting all "non-essential activities and related spending" on the project.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $7.4 billion Trans Mountain project would twin an existing pipeline, tripling the flow of <b>oil</b> flowing from Edmonton to Burnaby. To date, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> says it has spent about $1.1 billion on the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is bad news for the
 energy sector, and all the workers and families in the Peace Country 
that rely on our natural resources for their livelihood," said Member of
 Parliament for Grande Prairie - Mackenzie Chris Warkentin, in a 
statement on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Albertans were promised that the imposition of a carbon tax by the Trudeau and Notley governments would buy them '<b>social license</b>'to build pipelines to get our resources to competitive markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The loss of the Northern
 Gateway, Energy East, and now the suspension of the Trans Mountain 
expansion has confirmed that this promise was worthless."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pointed to the 
"uncertainty" created by the opposition of the B.C. government as the 
reason for the sudden announcement and said it will take until May 31 to
 consult with stakeholders to determine whether the project will 
continue construction through B.C. and whether shareholders can be 
protected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the company cannot 
reach an agreement with the various stakeholders by the May 31 deadline,
 Kinder Morgan chairman and CEO Steve Kean said it is "difficult to 
conceive of any scenario in which we would proceed with the project."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a Sunday press 
conference, Premier Rachel Notley said "this pipeline will be built". 
and threatened government action against B.C. if John Horgan's 
government - whom she called "short-sighted" - continued to oppose the 
project. She called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to act in defence 
of the project, which the federal government has approved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Albertans have been clear: Get this pipeline built. And Albertans are right," said Notley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Never count Alberta out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This pipeline will be 
built. Tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars to the economy.
 Better public schools. Better public hospitals. That's what this 
pipeline means for us and for our country as a whole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are also calling on 
the federal government to act in the defence of Alberta and working 
people in Western Canada in the way they have in the past for other 
parts of this country. A federal approval of a project must be worth 
more than the paper it's written on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warkentin said he shares "the frustration of Albertans" but is not surprised to see the project "faltering".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Canadians have come to expect this lack of progress, given the Prime Minister's track record of failure," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Canadians deserve a 
government that will actually get the job done. On behalf of the 
residents in the Peace Country and across Alberta and Canada, I'll 
continue to fight for economic opportunities in the energy sector and 
advocate for important pipelines that will help export our products to 
the world."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late Sunday, Trudeau tweeted the federal government "will act within national interests".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Access to world markets 
for Canadian resources is a core national interest. The Trans Mountain 
expansion will be built," tweeted Trudeau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley said Sunday the 
province is prepared to invest in the pipeline directly if it would help
 keep investors on board - a notion opposition rival, UCP Leader Jason 
Kenney, said he would support as long as Ottawa also puts money on the 
table.</p>

 SACHEDINA: Hello everyone, and welcome to "Power Play" for Friday, 
April 6th, the day when of fears of a US trade war with China sent the 
Dow plunging more than 500 points to the end week. More on that in just a
 moment. Coming up on the show, we'll talk to federal Conservative 
leader Andrew Scheer about trade tensions between Canada and the US, and
 his new demand that he will only accept a private classified briefing 
about the prime minister's trip to India after MPs get an unclassified 
one first. Also ahead, the prime minister's trip to Canada's <b>oil</b> 
heartland and how successful he was in winning over those who say his 
leadership on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion has been weak. And 
mega millionaire Kevin O'Leary talks to us about the money troubles 
stemming from his failed Conservative campaign bid. But first, a steep 
sell-off on the markets today after Donald Trump threatens China with an
 additional $100 billion in new tariffs, but the US's trading 
relationship with Canada and Mexico was also in the spotlight today. 
With his take on how <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> talks are 
going, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer joins me now. Mr. Scheer, it's 
great to have you on. I want to play a clip of the prime minister who 
was in Fort McMurray today and then get your reaction on that if we can.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
JUSTIN TRUDEAU (Canadian Prime Minister): We're pleased at the amount of
 chapters that have been closed, at the progress that has been made on a
 number of issues, but we're going to keep going and demonstrate that we
 take this issue very seriously. We'll continue to defend Canadian jobs,
 but we're hopeful to get positive news in the coming times. We're going
 to accept a good deal for Canada, not just any old deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: There is word 
that there may be an agreement in principle they may be ready to sign 
and approve at the Summit of the Americas next week. Can you at least 
give the government credit for coming as far as they have?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
ANDREW SCHEER (Conservative Leader): Well I'll give the government 
credit in the sense that dealing with President Trump on trade is no 
easy task. Usually you have a president that has a philosophical 
approach, either a free marketer or a protectionist, and you can kind of
 see that applied across. Mr. Trump seems to have a sector-by-sector 
approach all through the lens as to whether or not the US has a trade 
surplus or deficit in each specific commodity, which is not a 
conventional way to adopt that. We've been critical of the Liberal 
response early on. We think that they were late to the game in building 
the alliances throughout the US that we needed to build to get American 
pressure on the US administration. That started to happen recently, but 
we would have liked to have seen it earlier. We've been supportive of 
the government's efforts. I led a Conservative delegation down to 
Washington to show that united front. We want to help. We want Canada to
 get the very best deal that we can. It's so important. It transcends 
political lines. Encouraged to see the focus on actual market access and
 trade. You'll remember the Liberals were trying to bring in a lot of 
social policy into the negotiations, that didn't seem to go well. We 
hear a lot of talk that they've now pulled back from that and are 
focusing more on the economics and the reduction of trade barriers. 
We'll have to wait and see what comes out, though. No one has any 
details on specifics. We don't know if this is a general agreement with 
not a lot of details, or if this is a more substantial conclusion. We'll
 have more to say once we know what's in the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: One of the 
issues that you have not been supportive of is the government's plan 
when it comes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. You have spoken out 
strongly about the carbon tax, and this was one of the issues that has 
come up during the prime minister's tour of western Canada. First of 
all, do you believe that global warming is manmade? SCHEER: I believe 
that human beings absolutely have an impact on climate change. I believe
 that human beings emit all kinds of things into our environment that we
 need to address, that we need to reduce what we do emit into the 
environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: So if it's not
 a carbon tax, I haven't heard you talk much about what your plan is to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. SCHEER: Well keep in mind that the 
previous Conservative government actually reduced emissions without a 
carbon tax. We did that through incentivizing efficiencies, with, in 
encouraging people to, all kinds of things, from retrofitting their 
homes to regulating emissions on a sector-by-sector approach. I believe 
it's possible. But I'd like to flip this around a little bit, because 
here we have the environment minister and the prime minister both not 
being able to say how much the carbon tax will reduce emissions by. They
 were asked point blank questions, the minister of environment at 
committee, Justin Trudeau by myself in question period, I asked him by 
how much will emissions go down with a carbon tax. They don't have an 
answer. So I would challenge them to say what is the proof that the 
carbon tax actually works? Canadians don't support it. It hasn't given 
us the so-called <b>social license</b> to get important energy projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: But there are 
targets that Canada has signed on to in the Paris accord. So if you were
 to be prime minister after next year's election, is that an accord that
 you would stay in, or would you withdraw from that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: Well, we voted in
 favour of the motion upholding the Paris accord targets. I would also 
point out that after campaigning against the Conservative targets for 
reductions of greenhouse emissions, Justin Trudeau went to Paris and 
signed on to the exact same targets the Conservatives were proposing. So
 he's adopted our approach on this. But one thing that's not our 
approach is a carbon tax. I'm against it. I will repeal it. I don't 
believe it will reduce emissions. I think there's a more positive way to
 incentivize people and companies to reduce emissions without just 
grabbing more money from the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: I want to talk
 a little bit about the Atwal affair and switch gears. Today you are now
 saying that you will not accept this private classified briefing until 
MPs get one that's unclassified. Is there a danger here? Are you worried
 that you're overplaying your hand? I mean you know there's a filibuster
 in the house. MPs were up for a long time. You can basically just claim
 victory and walk away. Why this new demand now? SCHEER: It's not a new 
demand. When you look at the letter that I sent the clerk of the Privy 
Council, it was saying, look, we'll have a briefing, and we'll have it 
all together, and we'll go through all the publicly available 
information that can be disseminated publicly, and then anything 
classified I will stay and receive that. In a counter response, the 
clerk, Daniel Jean, has effectively indicated he'd be willing to go to 
committee. The reason why I'm concerned about this is because just a few
 weeks ago, Justin Trudeau used his majority on that committee, on the 
very committee that now Daniel jean is offering to go in front of, used 
his majority to vote against inviting him to committee. So their track 
record on this is not one that I have a lot of confidence in. They voted
 against the motion to invite him to testify. They put their MPs through
 20 hours of a marathon vote in order to avoid the very thing that now 
we're seeing. So all I've said to the Privy Council office is, great, 
happy to have a classified briefing, let me know when the public 
briefing takes place and then we can work on a date after that. I 
believe it's so important. Why the cover-up? Why they're going to such 
great lengths to avoid what was already told to reporters and 
journalists being told to parliament. We have conflicting information. 
Ralph Goodale , the minister of public safety, says that if we want to 
know information we can read it all in the media because it's all been 
reported, and then we have journalists who were on the call, on that 
conference call saying, no, no, we were told not to report some things. 
So there's, someone is not saying something that's true, and we want to 
get to the bottom of this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: So walk me through this. When will that briefing happen with you, and when will it happen with the committee?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: Well, as, my 
understanding is that Mr. Jean has reached out to the chair of the 
committee, the Liberal chair. We want that to happen very quickly. We 
want Liberals on that committee to support the idea of having a public 
hearing on this. We understand that there are some things that the 
national security advisor would know that's classified that can't be 
said in a public forum. That's fine. And he can instruct the committee 
as to when that happens. But everything that was said to journalists and
 reporters, I believe it's only right that the Canadian people have 
their elected representatives hear the same thing. After that I will 
very quickly find the right time to have that briefing on the classified
 side as was offered to me. I think that's important too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: I also want to
 get your reaction. We know that Rob Ford , who is vying to be Ontario's
 premier, is not going to have a campaign bus for journalists. What's 
your reaction to that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: I really don't have one. I don't know the logistics of running.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: Surely you must be able to say something about that. Do you support the idea or not?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: Look, every 
individual campaign will come up with their own media strategy. I have a
 media plan myself. I try to be as accessible as I can and speak to 
journalists when they're covering topics that they want to hear my voice
 on. We'll have our own plan for the federal campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: But this is a 
guy, if you're prime minister, you might have to work alongside. Can you
 say, you have talked about the role of the media, you know the previous
 Conservative government had somewhat of a fractious relationship with 
the media. Do you endorse Mr. Ford's...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: I really don't 
have views on how other people run their campaigns. When I ran for the 
leadership I had my own plan, I was often asked to comment on other 
people's style or other people's camps. I do my own thing. I run my own 
campaign. I'll be happy to work with the next premier of Ontario on 
issues. Hopefully it's a Conservative premier who wants to repeal the 
carbon tax, who wants to balance the budget and lower taxes. We'll work 
together on issues. I'm not going to weigh in on how he runs his 
campaign, whether or not he has a media bus or prints certain types of 
flyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: Then let me 
ask you this. Are journalists going to be allowed on your campaign bus 
in the campaign next year and on the plane?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: You know what, we
 haven't actually got to the point where we know exactly what we're 
doing in terms of buses and planes, but we'll have a healthy contingent 
of media officials at our events. It's important that I get my message 
out to as many people as I can, and of course the traditional media will
 be important, as will new media, as will new platforms to communicate 
to Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: All right, Mr. Scheer, great having you on. Thanks so much for joining us today. SCHEER: Thank you very much.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company has recently engaged <span class="companylink">Hatch Ltd</span>.
 (“Hatch”), a global engineering firm, to integrate and support its 
internal work on the technical and economic feasibility of this project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “This
 is an important milestone. Our preliminary feasibility work has been 
completed. It has not identified any red flags or unexpected technical 
challenges. It also suggests this project could be economic at today’s <b>oil</b> prices. We are looking forward to the results of the Hatch integration study later this summer to endorse our internal work.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commenting on next steps 
Mr. Binnion added, “Depending on the results of this integration study, 
we would move to pre-FEED engineering. These results and the subsequent 
pre-FEED and FEED engineering will form part of the proposed work 
program for the pre-development phase of a future concession agreement 
with the Jordanian government.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, the 
Company completed a review of the last of its nine studies covering all 
four aspects of the production of crude <b>oil</b> from its project in 
Jordan. These include mining and feed preparation, retorting, power, 
including utilities and infrastructure, and marketing and refining. The 
studies were completed by independent engineering firms including Hatch 
to develop technical and cost-effective solutions for these processes. 
Due to the size of the existing Jordanian refining infrastructure and 
the market for crude products in Jordan, the Company has included the 
costs to upgrade the produced crude <b>oil</b> to finished products 
including gasoline and diesel. Hatch completed four of the nine studies 
and will integrate all the studies into an independent assessment. The 
design basis for this assessment will be an initial project capable of 
sustaining production of 50,000 bbls/d.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The feasibility study follows the assessment of the <b>oil</b>
 shale resource completed by an independent qualified resource 
evaluator, Millcreek Mining Group, in accordance with National 
Instrument 51-101 – Standards of Disclosure for <b>Oil</b> and Gas Activities of the Canadian Securities Administrators (“NI 51-101”) and the Canadian <b>Oil</b>
 and Gas Evaluation Handbook (“COGE Handbook”) (the “Resource 
Assessment”). The Resource Assessment estimates a best estimate of 
Discovered Petroleum Initially In Place (“DPIIP”) of between 7.8 billion
 and 12.2 billion barrels. The Resource Assessment was prepared in 
accordance with NI 51-101 and the COGE Handbook with an effective date 
of October 1, 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DPIIP was the most 
specific assignable category of resources at the time of the Resource 
Assessment given the preliminary nature of the Resource Assessment, the 
nature of recovery of the hydrocarbons by means of mining and retorting 
and that a program of work to determine commercial viability using 
established technology had not yet been completed. In addition, as a 
result of the preliminary nature of the Resource Assessment, it did not 
contain any estimates regarding the timing or cost to obtain commercial 
development. The accuracy of resource estimates is, in part, a function 
of the quality and quantity of available data and of engineering and 
geological interpretation and judgment. Given the data available at the 
time the Resource Assessment was prepared, the estimates presented 
therein are considered reasonable. The availability of additional data 
and analysis, after the date of the estimates, may necessitate 
revisions. These revisions may be material. There is no certainty that 
any portion of the resources will be discovered. If discovered, there is
 no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion
 of the resources.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advisory Regarding Forward-Looking Statements</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This news release 
contains certain statements which constitute forward-looking statements 
or information (“forward-looking statements”) including the discovery of
 resources in respect of the Jordan <b>oil</b> shale project and the 
commercial viability of producing any resources so discovered, the 
Company’s opinion that its preliminary feasibility work has not 
identified any unexpected technical challenges, that preliminary 
feasibility work suggests the project could be economic at current <b>oil</b>
 prices, the Company’s expectations of the timing and results from the 
Hatch integration study, the timing and decision to proceed to pre-FEED 
and FEED engineering, the Company’s plans to include this in the 
pre-development phase of a future concession agreement with the 
Jordanian government and its plans to apply for this concession 
agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forward-looking 
statements are based on a number of material factors, expectations or 
assumptions of Questerre which have been used to develop such statements
 and information, but which may prove to be incorrect. Although 
Questerre believes that the expectations reflected in these 
forward-looking statements are reasonable, undue reliance should not be 
placed on them because Questerre can give no assurance that they will 
prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements address future 
events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks 
and uncertainties. The Company choose to base their study on a 50,000 
barrel per day project, as that is the amount of production required to 
justify the cost of upgrading the product produced by the Company, such 
cost being factored into such feasibility study. There is nothing to 
indicate that this level of production will actually be achieved in 
respect of the Jordan <b>oil</b> shale project, as there is no history 
of production and no reserves have been attributed to such property. 
Although the Company believes that this assumption is reasonable in 
light of the current information available to it at this time, there is a
 significant risk that such level of production will not be achieved and
 that the estimated total capital and operating costs set forth above 
will not be achieved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further, events or 
circumstances may cause actual results to differ materially from those 
predicted as a result of numerous known and unknown risks, 
uncertainties, and other factors, many of which are beyond the control 
of the Company, including, without limitation: whether the Company's 
exploration and development activities respecting its prospects will be 
successful or that material volumes of petroleum and natural gas 
reserves will be encountered, or if encountered can be produced on a 
commercial basis; the ultimate size and scope of any hydrocarbon bearing
 formations on its lands; that drilling operations on its lands will be 
successful such that further development activities in these areas are 
warranted; that Questerre will continue to conduct its operations in a 
manner consistent with past operations; results from drilling and 
development activities will be consistent with past operations; the 
general stability of the economic and political environment in which 
Questerre operates; drilling results; field production rates and decline
 rates; the general continuance of current industry conditions; the 
timing and cost of pipeline, storage and facility construction and 
expansion and the ability of Questerre to secure adequate product 
transportation; future commodity prices; currency, exchange and interest
 rates; regulatory framework regarding royalties, taxes and 
environmental matters in the jurisdictions in which Questerre operates; 
and the ability of Questerre to successfully market its <b>oil</b> and 
natural gas products; changes in commodity prices; changes in the demand
 for or supply of the Company's products; unanticipated operating 
results or production declines; changes in tax or environmental laws, 
changes in development plans of Questerre or by third party operators of
 Questerre's properties, increased debt levels or debt service 
requirements; inaccurate estimation of Questerre's <b>oil</b> and gas 
reserve and resource volumes; limited, unfavourable or a lack of access 
to capital markets; increased costs; a lack of adequate insurance 
coverage; the impact of competitors; and certain other risks detailed 
from time-to-time in Questerre's public disclosure documents. Additional
 information regarding some of these risks, expectations or assumptions 
and other factors may be found under in the Company's Annual Information
 Form for the year ended December 31, 2017 and other documents available

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resource Definitions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resources encompasses all
 petroleum quantities that originally existed on or within the earth's 
crust in naturally occurring accumulations, including Discovered and 
Undiscovered (recoverable and unrecoverable) plus quantities already 
produced. "Total resources" is equivalent to "Total Petroleum Initially 
In Place". Resources are classified in the following categories:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total Petroleum Initially
 In Place ("TPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is estimated to 
exist originally in naturally occurring accumulations. It includes that 
quantity of petroleum that is estimated, as of a given date, to be 
contained in known accumulations, prior to production, plus those 
estimated quantities in accumulations yet to be discovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovered Petroleum 
Initially In Place ("DPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is 
estimated, as of a given date, to be contained in known accumulations 
prior to production. The recoverable portion of discovered petroleum 
initially in place includes production, reserves, and Contingent 
Resources; the remainder is unrecoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources are 
those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established 
technology or technology under development but which are not currently 
considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more 
contingencies. Economic Contingent Resources (“ECR”) are those 
contingent resources that are currently economically recoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undiscovered Petroleum 
Initially In Place ("UPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is 
estimated, on a given date, to be contained in accumulations yet to be 
discovered. The recoverable portion of undiscovered petroleum initially 
in place is referred to as "prospective resources" and the remainder as 
"unrecoverable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective Resources are
 those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application 
of future development projects. Prospective resources have both an 
associated chance of discovery and a chance of development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unrecoverable is that 
portion of DPIIP and UPIIP quantities which is estimated, as of a given 
date, not to be recoverable by future development projects. A portion of
 these quantities may become recoverable in the future as commercial 
circumstances change or technological developments occur; the remaining 
portion may never be recovered due to the physical/chemical constraints 
represented by subsurface interaction of fluids and reservoir rocks. 
Uncertainty Ranges are described by the Canadian <b>Oil</b> and Gas Evaluation Handbook as low, best, and high estimates for reserves and resources as follows:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low Estimate: This is 
considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities
 recovered will exceed the low estimate. If probabilistic methods are 
used, there should be at least a 90 percent probability (P90) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the low estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best Estimate: This is 
considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will actually be
 recovered. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities 
recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate. If 
probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50 percent 
probability (P50) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or 
exceed the best estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High Estimate: This is 
considered to be an optimistic estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual remaining 
quantities recovered will exceed the high estimate. If probabilistic 
methods are used, there should be at least a 10 percent probability 
(P10) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the 
high estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certain resource estimate
 volumes disclosed herein are arithmetic sums of multiple estimates of 
DPIIP, which statistical principles indicate may be misleading as to 
volumes that may actually be recovered. Readers should give attention to
 the estimates of individual classes of resources and appreciate the 
differing probabilities of recovery associated with each class as 
explained under this Resource Definitions section.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's
 New Democratic government introduced its 2018-19 budget last week, and 
it is likely to be a pivotal moment for the grand and indubitably noble 
cause of democratic socialism, or social democracy, or whatever we're 
calling it now, in Alberta. Our next provincial election is supposed to 
happen, by statute, next spring - "on or before" May 31. If that is how 
things pan out, the New Democrats will get to introduce, and in theory 
run behind, an election budget. But in the meantime, a full year of 
campaigning will have taken place, and will have been conducted on the 
basis of last week's budget.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One
 of the key themes will be carbon taxation. In arguments about the 
Alberta carbon tax, the design of the actual instrument has mostly been 
beside the point until now. The whole idea of taxing carbon, as such, 
strikes at the heart of Alberta's cultural self-identification: to many 
Albertans, raised on tales of Leduc No. 1 and the National Energy 
Program and the Heritage Fund, it is morally offensive in itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta is about 
hydrocarbons in sort of the same deep sense in which Quebec can be 
thought of as being "about" the French language. An Alberta carbon tax 
(a pioneering, world-leading one!) was always going to play, with large 
Alberta audiences, as an act of hysterical self-mortification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP had to know that 
there would be an inherent political price to be paid for its approach -
 that its carbon policy would, for some Albertans, be altogether beyond 
rational discussion. But nobody should underestimate the number of 
Albertans who are at the far opposite end of this spectrum - equally 
beyond reason in the other direction. A lot of Albertans hate that 
Alberta is about hydrocarbons: they go about in a state of constant 
low-level eco-spleen. Almost certainly the business of 
hydrocarbon-digging brought their parents here, or their grandparents, 
but they have grown up with endless propaganda about the 
species'planet-killing error of ever using fossil fuels, and they 
naturally feel trapped or swindled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP's carbon tax 
rhetoric was designed to appeal to those who lie between these two poles
 of irrationality. The United Conservatives have already spent a lot of 
time heckling the New Democrats over their implied promise that a carbon
 tax would provide <b>social license</b> for pipeline projects that might help Alberta realize un-discounted world prices for ecologically laundered <b>oil</b>. The preferred rebuttal of carbon tax advocates is that "<b>social license</b>" is actually <b>oil</b>-industry
 jargon. But there can be no doubt that the carbon tax was designed, and
 politically marketed, on the basis of reputational benefits that have 
not yet panned out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Rachel Notley has talked a pretty good game about Alberta deserving to 
benefit from appropriately taxed carbon-grubbing, but the UCP can show 
that her caucus and her braintrust are full of former Splenetics who 
used to wave handmade protest signs about Dirty <b>Oil</b>. The fallback
 argument, for the NDP, is that the carbon tax is a worthwhile incentive
 in itself. The point is not merely to hoover up new revenue, but simply
 to price, and thereby discourage, carbon pollution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be useful for 
the NDP to show, in making this argument, that the tax was wholly 
revenue-neutral - that it was not being used to increase the size of 
government, but was being given back to Albertans. The 2018-19 budget 
makes that part of the case more complicated for them. Under the new 
implied provincial price of $30 per ton of carbon emitted, the revenues 
from carbon taxation are expected to come to about $1.4 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only $525 million of that
 will be handed back to Alberta taxpayers directly, in rebate cheques to
 lower-income households. The government intends to spend more than 
what's left over from that revenue - over a billion dollars - on 
carbonabatement projects under the Climate Leadership Plan. Close to 
half will go to public transit and other public infrastructure; over 
$200 million will be used to support coal towns being annihilated by the
 decarbonization of Alberta electricity; some of it will go to favoured 
"clean tech" researchers and businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New Democratic 
narrative will be that this should not really count as a tax grab, 
because the money, having most definitely been grabbed, is to be 
"reinvested" within Alberta. But if the most important point of the 
carbon tax was the price incentive, the NDP could have cut other taxes 
to make it truly revenue-neutral. It could even have provided a bigger, 
even more progressive cash rebate that wasn't a mere fraction of the 
revenue yield. (Mind you, I am aware of no leftist radical anywhere who 
is criticizing the Alberta carbon tax on this basis.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's worse, the federal
 government's umbrella carbon tax plan will increase the implied carbon 
price to $40 a ton in 2021, while passing the money along to Alberta, 
and the NDP's fiscal plan admits that, if it is still in charge, it will
 keep the additional money for use in "general revenue." If you're a 
middle-ground Albertan who is comfortable with a carbon tax as a 
concept, what do you have left to say to anyone who warned that such a 
tax could easily be increased, and might become another way of stiffing 
the taxpayer and increasing government expenditure? This is a surrender 
of moral high ground to essentially religious procarbon sentiment: those
 zanies, it seems, warned us of a millennium that is arriving fast.</p>

 ("Pulse" or the "Company") (TSX-V: PUL and PUL.WT) reports today that 
Pulse has initiated Phase 1 of the Bigoray Nisku Pinnacle Reef Enhanced <b>Oil</b> Recovery ("EOR") project in the Bigoray area of Alberta ("Bigoray").</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As previously announced on January 9, 2018, and as summarized below, <span class="companylink">Sproule Associates Limited</span>
 ("Sproule"), an independent qualified reserves evaluator, completed an 
independent resource assessment that includes the Bigoray EOR project 
potential only, and is in addition to the previously disclosed baseline 
independently assessed reserves in the Company's core areas at Bigoray 
and Queenstown.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sproule assessed a best estimate Discovered Petroleum Initially in-Place (PIIP) of 23.292 million barrels of <b>oil</b>
 ("boe") within Pulse's 100% controlled Nisku D and Nisku E Pools, which
 Pulse views as conservative, given the Alberta Regulator lists PIIP as 
26.51 million boe's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Resource Assessment was prepared in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 –Standards of Disclosure for <b>Oil</b> and Gas Activities&nbsp;of the Canadian Securities Administrators ("NI 51-101") and the Canadian <b>Oil</b> and Gas Evaluation Handbook ("COGE Handbook").</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more information on the Sproule independent resource assessment, please see "Independent Resource Assessment Details" below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulse also announces the 
appointment of a Bigoray EOR Project Manager, Bill Sawchuk, a 
Professional Petroleum Engineer and an EOR expert to oversee all 
technical and planning aspects of the EOR program. With over 20 years 
of&nbsp;experience as a senior engineering manager and a technical 
expert in reservoir engineering and enhanced <b>oil</b> recovery methods. Bill has previously served as an Exploitation Engineer for Anderson Exploration Ltd. and <span class="companylink">Devon Canada Corporation</span>
 and most recently, as Manager of Engineering for ARC Resources Ltd. 
where he led teams to optimize production and implement valuable 
Enhanced <b>Oil</b> Recovery projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulse is excited that 
initial critical facility aspects of the Bigoray EOR project are now 
underway, using working capital on hand in preparation for the EOR 
Injection Phase to be implemented in 2018 as planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phase 1 of the EOR 
project ("Phase 1"), which includes re-activation of existing injection 
facilities, will also allow Pulse to cost-effectively reactivate up to 3
 current shut-in <b>oil</b> producers to add approximately 400 BOE/d (100% working interest) of new light <b>oil</b> and gas production prior to the EOR project taking place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Cadenhead, President and COO of Pulse <b>Oil</b>,
 commented, "We are eagerly awaiting the Bigoray EOR project to be fully
 underway later this year and the start of Phase 1 is a very low-cost 
starting point; it's really exciting for everyone involved.&nbsp; This 
critical facility work not only marks the start of the EOR project for 
us, it allows us to get additional shut-in production re-activated in 
the near-term while we prepare for the water injection phase of the 
project in 2018. This interim production boost will provide additional 
revenues which will be reinvested in the Bigoray EOR program later this 
year as planned."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Independent Resource Assessment Details:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sproule Independent 
Resource Assessment provides estimates categorized as "high", "best" and
 "low" for contingent resources associated with the Bigoray EOR project 
on the two pools, with the unrisked high estimate being 8.07 million boe
 (92.6% <b>Oil</b>), a best estimate of 6.136 million boe (91.3% <b>Oil</b>) and a low estimate of 3.668 million boe (89.1% <b>Oil</b>).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, the 
Resource Assessment prepared by Sproule calculated risked contingent 
resources where the risked assessment assigned a 77% chance of Pulse 
proceeding with the EOR project (see Table 2 below) and resulting in a 
best estimate of risked contingent resources net to Pulse of 4.694 
million boe (91.2% <b>Oil</b>).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Cadenhead, President and COO of Pulse <b>Oil</b>, commented, "The Sproule Resource Assessment is a positive independent commercial confirmation for our Bigoray Nisku Enhanced <b>Oil</b>
 Recovery project. Although this assessment used a more conservative 
approach to Petroleum Initially in-Place ("PIIP") compared with the PIIP
 estimates of the Alberta Energy Regulator, we are excited to see that 
even this more conservative approach resulted in a strong endorsement 
for the project. With an independent un-risked high case upside 
estimated at over 8 million boe's of contingent resources (92% <b>oil</b>),
 the opportunity to move forward with our EOR project to bring on stream
 substantial cashflow while targeting to recover those types of <b>oil</b> volumes without drilling a well, creates a substantial opportunity to enhance value for Pulse and our shareholders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Resource Assessment 
focussed exclusively on two Nisku pools only in the Bigoray area, and 
included just 2,720 acres of Pulse's 44,720 acre core area holdings 
which includes 14,000 acres at Bigoray alone. Future evaluations may be 
done on Pulse's Mannville, Cardium and Pekisko formations that are 
thought to also provide significant growth opportunities for the Company
 as well as additional Nisku assets/pools held within Pulse's existing 
holdings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cadenhead further 
added, "As part of the Resource Assessment, the evaluator assessed a 
total risk of 77% that the project would proceed, citing economic 
factors and/or timing of development as one of the only risks associated
 with the project. All technical risks such as&nbsp;evaluation drilling,
 regulatory approvals, technology, legal factors, infrastructure and 
markets, political factors and social licence were all assigned 100% 
chance of commerciality.&nbsp;Our goal is to make this project happen in
 2018 and with the <b>oil</b> prices holding firmly above US$60 WTI 
pricing, the economics of this EOR project and return for shareholders 
continue to look more and more attractive alongside improving <b>oil</b> prices." &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Resource Assessment 
is based on the results from seventeen wells and, where available, core 
data. Where core was not available, the assessment considered log data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resource 
volumes for these discovered resources have been classified as 
'development unclarified' with Sproule assessing that there is a high 
probability of the Bigoray EOR project becoming a commercial 
development. Pulse will continue to complete project planning associated
 with the project and move forward with its execution plans in 
2018.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resource Definitions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resources encompasses all
 petroleum quantities that originally existed on or within the earth's 
crust in naturally occurring accumulations, including Discovered and 
Undiscovered (recoverable and unrecoverable) plus quantities already 
produced. "Total Resources" is equivalent to "Total Petroleum Initially 
In-Place". Resources are classified in the following categories:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total Petroleum Initially
 In-Place ("TPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is estimated to 
exist originally in naturally occurring accumulations. It includes that 
quantity of petroleum that is estimated, as of a given date, to be 
contained in known accumulations, prior to production, plus those 
estimated quantities in accumulations yet to be discovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovered Petroleum 
Initially In-Place ("DPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is 
estimated, as of a given date, to be contained in known accumulations 
prior to production. The recoverable portion of DPIIP includes 
production, reserves, and Contingent Resources; the remainder is 
unrecoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources are 
those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established 
technology or technology under development but which are not currently 
considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more 
contingencies. Economic Contingent Resources (ECR) are those contingent 
resources that are currently economically recoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undiscovered Petroleum 
Initially In Place ("UPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is 
estimated, on a given date, to be contained in accumulations yet to be 
discovered. The recoverable portion of UPIIP is referred to as 
Prospective Resources and the remainder is unrecoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective Resources are
 those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application 
of future development projects. Prospective Resources have both an 
associated chance of discovery and a chance of development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unrecoverable is that 
portion of DPIIP and UPIIP quantities which is estimated, as of a given 
date, not to be recoverable by future development projects. A portion of
 these quantities may become recoverable in the future as commercial 
circumstances change or technological developments occur; the remaining 
portion may never be recovered due to the physical/chemical constraints 
represented by subsurface interaction of fluids and reservoir rocks. 
Uncertainty Ranges are described by the Canadian <b>Oil</b> and Gas Evaluation Handbook as low, best, and high estimates for reserves and resources as follows:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low Estimate: This is 
considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities
 recovered will exceed the low estimate. If probabilistic methods are 
used, there should be at least a 90 percent probability (P90) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the low estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best Estimate: This is 
considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will actually be
 recovered. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities 
recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate. If 
probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50 percent 
probability (P50) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or 
exceed the best estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High Estimate: This is 
considered to be an optimistic estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual remaining 
quantities recovered will exceed the high estimate. If probabilistic 
methods are used, there should be at least a 10 percent probability 
(P10) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the 
high estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development Unclarified 
is a project maturity sub-class of contingent resources that refers to 
the development plan evaluation is not complete and there is ongoing 
activity to resolve any risks or uncertainties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certain resource estimate
 volumes disclosed herein are arithmetic sums of multiple estimates of 
DPIIP or UPIIP, which statistical principles indicate may be misleading 
as to volumes that may actually be recovered. Readers should give 
attention to the estimates of individual classes of resources and 
appreciate the differing probabilities of recovery associated with each 
class as explained under this&nbsp;Resource Definitions&nbsp;section.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a line," says 
Cedar. "There's a line that's not even in the sand anymore. It's in the 
fricken mud. We can't cross it anymore. Yes, we need jobs for people, 
but we need good, sustainable jobs in renewable resources. To keep using
 these fossil fuels, and expanding their use, isn't the right way to 
provide them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cedar says the fact that 
projects like the Kinder Morgan pipeline expansion and Site C Dam 
Project keep getting approved show us that we're not taking the health 
of our planet seriously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It makes no sense to me 
that all these things are continuing when they are polluting and 
destroying our Earth," Cedar says. "In terms of full-cost economics – 
because we don't calculate the cost of pollution, we continue on with 
the status quo – It makes no sense. It makes no eco-logic."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the protest, 
Cedar and the other protesters delivered jars of water to Blaney's 
office, "representing the fact that we have to take care of it and stand
 for what is right before it's too late," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blaney was not at the 
constituency office Friday, but those jars were received on her behalf 
by constituency assistant Lucas Schuller, who says he also delivered a 
statement on Blaney's behalf in support of the protester's efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Kinder Morgan 
expansion was given federal approval through a review process that the 
Trudeau government acknowledged was flawed, yet have refused to fix," 
the statement reads. "Our communities have legitimate environmental 
concerns that have not been addressed. Without <b>social license</b>, 
without meeting the commitments of the UN Declaration of Rights of 
Indigenous peoples, this project should not have been approved. We will 
continue to stand with those who fight for our coast."</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 throne speech that marked the opening of the legislature earlier this 
month was clearly aimed at more than just Albertans. One of its key 
themes was the need to get our <b>oil</b> to tidewater, where it will 
fetch a higher price than fuel sold to the United States, which is where
 the great majority of our energy is exported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The speech, read by 
Lt.-Gov. Lois Mitchell, had British Columbians in mind; in particular, 
Premier John Horgan, who has voiced strong opposition to the Trans 
Mountain pipeline.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The
 dispute British Columbia triggered with its attack on Canadian workers 
will not stand," the government said in the speech. "We won't let it. We
 have been vigilant in defending our workers and we will remain 
vigilant."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a well-crafted 
message, but when the government's budget is released Thursday 
afternoon, the Rachel Notley government must ensure Albertans' interests
 are at the heart of its fiscal blueprint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since coming to power in 
2015, the NPD has posted irresponsible deficits. Its predecessor, the 
Conservative party, also failed to balance the books under successive 
premiers, but there was nothing like the NDP has done in the supposed 
defence of front-line services such as health care and education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP has spent 
taxpayer money with abandon, to the point that credit agencies, which 
determine how much Albertans will pay in interest on the massive amount 
of borrowing, have downgraded the province's rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP is clearly an 
ally of the organized labour movement, but it needs to expand its reach 
and popularity if it hopes to win reelection next spring. Many Albertans
 are seeking some financial prudence as opposed to the spending 
free-for-all we've been witness to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worryingly, that's not 
likely to be the case when Thursday's budget is revealed. Finance 
Minister Joe Ceci said Tuesday that the document will include 
anticipated revenue from expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, 
apparently with the aim of balancing the budget within five years - well
 after the next election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No sensible homeowner 
would cobble together a budget with the assumption they'd be getting a 
pay increase in a few years. And yet this is what passes for NDP 
mathematics - the hope that having imposed a punitive carbon tax on its 
citizens to win so-called <b>social license</b> for pipelines, that 
politicians who are indifferent to energy infrastructure, or openly 
oppose them, are going to facilitate the flow of billions of dollars 
into Alberta's coffers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP have proven to be
 poor money managers, but surely we're not to have faith in such wild 
speculation. Opposition Leader Jason Kenney sees the danger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We obviously hope that 
Trans Mountain gets built quickly, but what we've seen is a year of 
delays already and the very strong potential of yet further delays," 
said the United Conservative Party leader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is putting a lot of eggs in one uncertain basket, and that's not how you budget."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government should 
focus instead on reducing costs. Last year's budget projected that by 
2020, Alberta's debt will be $70 billion - which is the equivalent of 
$16,500 for every person in the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists Janice 
MacKinnon and Jack Mintz argue that Alberta can learn lessons from other
 provinces, such as Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia, which spent an
 average of $9,233 per capita last year on services. Alberta spent 
$12,409 per person - that's $3,176 more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In health care alone, 
they note, Alberta spends $915 more per capita than the average of the 
other three large provinces, which means spending $3.8 billion more 
annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP shouldn't put 
revenue from incompleted pipelines in its ledgers. It should engage in 
the thoughtful work Albertans elected them to do and focus on reducing 
expenses.</p>

2019 starting with the implementation of five waterflood pilots. 
Assuming a positive reservoir response to the pilot flood, a full-scale 
water injection project would be implemented by BEL. Initially the 
drilling of two down dip injection wells located in the water leg of the
 FS reservoir would be carried out. The drilling of a total of nine 
injection wells is planned over a five-year period from three existing 
platforms and one new platform to be constructed on the western flank of
 the reservoir.</p>

 Notes:
 
 (1)   Contingent Resources are estimates of volumes that are potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established technology or technology under development, but which are not currently considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more contingencies.
 
 (2)   The volumes reported here are “risked” in the sense that they have been adjusted for chance of development. The chance of development is defined as the probability of a project being commercially viable. Quantifying the chance of development requires consideration of both economic contingencies and other contingencies, such as legal, regulatory, market access, political, <b>social license</b>, internal and external approvals and commitment to project finance and development timing. As many of these factors are extremely difficult to quantify, the chance of development is uncertain and must be used with caution. ERCE determined that a 70 percent chance of development is appropriate for the Contingent Resources.
 
 (3)   Gross Contingent Resources are all volumes estimated to be recoverable from the field without any economic cut-off being applied. Gross Weight Interest Contingent Resources is adjusted for the Company’s 80% working interest fraction of the Gross Contingent Resources. Net Contingent Resources are adjusted for the Company’s working interest share after deduction of royalty obligations.
 
 (4)   Project maturity for Contingent Resources has been classified as Development Unclarified.

 Notes:
 
 (1)  The above table has been disclosed consistent with the classification and reporting requirements of PRMS. 
 
 (2)  “Gross Unrisked Prospective Resources” are all volumes estimated to be recoverable from an accumulation. There is no equivalent COGEH definition.
 
 (3)  “Net Unrisked Prospective Resources” are the Company’s working interest fraction of the Gross Unrisked Prospective Resources. The equivalent COGEH definition disclosed below is “Gross Working Interest Prospective Resources” which is the Company’s working interest fraction in Prospective Resources prior to the deduction of royalties. 
 
 (4)  “Net Risked Prospective Resources” are the Company’s working interest fraction of the Net Unrisked Prospective Resources multiplied by the geological chance of success (“COS”).  The COS is an estimate of the probability that drilling the prospect would result in a discovery as defined under PRMS. ERCE has assigned a chance of success of 32% to the Prospective Resources. Under COGEH, prospective resources are risked by a chance of commerciality, being the product of the chance of development and the chance of discovery. For further detail, see below notes (2)-(4) of the table entitled “Prospective Resources, Gum Deniz Miocene Prospect”.
 
 (5)  Prospective Resources reported here are both “unrisked” in that they have not been multiplied by the COS and “risked” in that the volumes have been multiplied by the COS.

Fasila horizon in the Bahar field and a significant Miocene exploration 
objective beneath the Gum Deniz <b>Oil</b> field that can be drilled from Gum Island with a suitable land based rig, with combined original <b>oil</b> in place estimates in excess of a hundred million barrel of <b>oil</b> equivalent if a discovery is made.”</p>

</pre>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reason for Variance</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The primary factors 
contributing to lower than expected production were: (i) the slower pace
 of executing scheduled workovers, reflecting, in part, limited access 
to heavy lift vessels; (ii) the lower than expected post-workover 
production rates; and (iii) the slow pace of south Gum Deniz Electric 
Submersible Pumps (ESP) installations as workovers in old wellbores 
required additional cleaning and scraping runs. The Corporation plans to
 address the limited access to heavy lift vessels through the 
acquisition of a heavier rig that is better suited to deal with the 
challenges imposed by the old wells and difficult workovers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, Bahar 
Energy Operating Company Limited elected to defer both capital and 
operating expenditures until the development plan and reservoir studies 
were completed which would further facilitate the delineation and 
selection of the best projects going forward. The reservoir studies were
 initially expected to be completed by April of 2017, in respect of the 
gas field, and by midyear 2017, in respect of the <b>oil</b> field. 
However, the studies were not completed until Q1 2018 as a result of the
 identification of development opportunities (particularly waterfloods),
 additional evaluation work requested by the reserve auditors (<span class="companylink">GLJ Petroleum Consultants</span>
 and ERCE), and data inconsistencies resulting from scribed logs and 
well files that required clarification and further delineation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In light of lower than 
expected production, the Company revised its 2017 budget, resulting in 
downward adjustments to capital expenditures to $9.7 million (from 
guidance of USD$21 million) and operating expenses to $23 million (from 
guidance of USD$28 million). The deferral of projected expenditures 
intended to increase gross lease production from 4,167 boe/d at December
 31, 2016 resulted in the realization of approximately 24% less revenue 
than originally expected by the Company.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disclosure of <b>Oil</b> and Gas Information</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Information Regarding Disclosure on <b>Oil</b>
 and Gas Resources. The resources data set forth above is based upon an 
independent resource assessment and evaluation prepared by ERCE with an 
effective date of March 2, 2018. The resources were evaluated in 
accordance with the standards contained in the Canadian <b>Oil</b> and 
Gas Evaluation Handbook and the resource definitions contained in NI 
51-101, and consistent with the classification and reporting 
requirements of PRMS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OOIP Disclosure. The term original-<b>oil</b>-in-place (“OOIP”) is equivalent to total petroleum initially-in-place (“TPIIP”). TPIIP, as defined in the Canadian <b>Oil</b>
 and Gas Evaluation Handbook, is that quantity of petroleum that is 
estimated to exist in naturally occurring accumulations. It includes 
that quantity of petroleum that is estimated, as of a given date, to be 
contained in known accumulations, prior to production, plus those 
estimated quantities in accumulations yet to be discovered. A portion of
 the TPIIP is considered undiscovered and there is no certainty that any
 portion of such undiscovered resources will be discovered. If 
discovered, there is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to
 produce any portion of such undiscovered resources. With respect to the
 portion of the TPIIP that is considered discovered resources, there is 
no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion 
of such discovered resources. A significant portion of the estimated 
volumes of TPIIP will never be recovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOE Disclosure. For the 
purpose of calculating unit costs, natural gas volumes have been 
converted to a boe using six thousand cubic feet equal to one barrel 
unless otherwise stated. A boe conversion ratio of 6:1 is based upon an 
energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner 
tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. This 
conversion conforms to NI 51-101. Boe may be misleading, particularly if
 used in isolation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources and 
Prospective Resources. Contingent resources are the quantities of 
petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable 
from known accumulations using established technology or technology 
underdevelopment, but which are not currently considered to be 
commercially recoverable due to one or more contingencies. Contingencies
 are conditions that must be satisfied for a portion of contingent 
resources to be classified as reserves that are: (a) specific to the 
project being evaluated; and (b) expected to be resolved within a 
reasonable timeframe. Contingencies may include factors such as 
economic, legal, environmental, political and regulatory matters or a 
lack of markets. It is also appropriate to classify as contingent 
resources the estimated discovered recoverable quantities associated 
with a project in the early evaluation stage.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective Resources are
 those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application 
of future development projects. Prospective resources have both an 
associated chance of discovery and a chance of development. Not all 
exploration projects will result in discoveries. The chance that an 
exploration project will result in the discovery of petroleum is 
referred to as the chance of discovery. Thus, for an undiscovered 
accumulation the chance of commerciality is the product of two risk 
components-the chance of discovery and the chance of development. There 
is no certainty that any portion of the Prospective Resources will be 
discovered. If discovered, there is no certainty that it will be 
commercially viable to produce any portion of the Prospective Resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estimates of the 
Contingent Resources and Prospective Resources are based upon the report
 prepared by ERCE, the Company’s independent qualified resources 
evaluators, effective as of March 2, 2018. The estimates of Contingent 
Resources and Prospective Resources provided in this press release are 
estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated Contingent 
Resources and Prospective Resources will be recovered. Actual contingent
 and prospective resources may be greater than or less than the 
estimates provided in this in this press release and the differences may
 be material. There is no certainty that any portion of the Prospective 
Resources will be discovered. If discovered, there is no certainty that 
it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the Prospective
 Resources. There is also uncertainty that it will be commercially 
viable to produce any part of the Contingent Resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estimates of contingent 
and prospective resources are by their nature more speculative than 
estimates of proved reserves and would require substantial capital 
spending over a significant number of years to implement recovery. 
Actual locations drilled and quantities that may be ultimately recovered
 from our properties will differ substantially. In addition, we have 
made no commitment to drill, and likely will not drill, all of the 
drilling locations that have been attributable to these quantities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective resources 
estimates that are referred to herein are risked as to both chance of 
discovery and chance of development and both risked and unrisked to the 
COS under PRMS. Contingent resources estimates that are referred to 
herein are both risked and risked as to chance of development. Risks 
that could impact the chance of discovery and chance of development 
include, without limitation: geological uncertainty and uncertainty 
regarding individual well drainage areas; uncertainty regarding the 
consistency of productivity that may be achieved from lands with 
attributed resources; potential delays in development due to product 
prices, access to capital, availability of markets and/or take-away 
capacity; and uncertainty regarding potential flow rates from wells and 
the economics of those wells. Risk assessment is a highly subjective 
process dependent upon the experience and judgment of the evaluators and
 is subject to revision with further data acquisition or interpretation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The following classification of contingent and prospective resources is used in the press release:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Low Estimate (or 1C) 
means there is at least a 90 percent probability (P90) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the low estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Best Estimate (or 2C) 
means there is at least a 50 percent probability (P50) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the best estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* High Estimate (or 3C) 
means there is at least a 10 percent probability (P10) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the high estimate. In
 general, the significant factors that may change the Contingent 
Resources estimates include further delineation drilling, which could 
change the estimates either positively or negatively, future technology 
improvements, which would positively affect the estimates, and 
additional processing capacity that could affect the volumes recoverable
 or type of production. Additional facility design work, development 
plans, and reservoir studies are expected to be completed by Greenfields
 in accordance with its long-term resource development plan.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there's one thing I hope all Albertans can agree on, it's the desperate need for more pipelines to get our abundant <b>oil</b>
 and gas resources to market. According to recent reports, Alberta is 
losing $7 billion per year because of lack of pipeline capacity, with 
industry losing $6.7 billion more annually.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While
 we disagree with how the NDP has handled the strategy surrounding the 
Trans Mountain expansion, we don't doubt the need for the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't that long ago 
when pipelines were built in this country with little controversy. Under
 the previous Harper government, four major pipeline projects were 
completed. Keystone, Alberta Clipper, the Line 9 reversal and Anchor 
Loop were all successfully completed under the previous government, 
adding 1.73 million barrels per day of capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, it is true that none
 of these projects were to tidewater, as the NDP is happy to point out. 
But Trans Mountain was not up for government approval under the previous
 Conservative government. The NDP's cousins in Ottawa would no doubt 
have howled with outrage if the Harper government dared to short circuit
 the regulatory process by approving a pipeline before a thorough review
 was completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northern Gateway, the one
 tidewater pipeline up for decision under the Harper Conservatives, was 
indeed approved. Sadly, the project was retroactively cancelled by the 
Trudeau Liberals as part of their plan to ban tanker traffic off B.C.'s 
northern coast (never mind that Alaskan tankers have travelled down that
 route for decades). And the Trudeau Liberals later rigged the approval 
process midstream to scuttle Energy East, another pipeline to tidewater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, radical activists have engaged in a concerted effort to specifically target and sideline Canada's <b>oil</b>
 and gas industry, viewing us as ripe for the picking. Millions of 
dollars of foreign funding have flooded into the Canadian environmental 
movement with the clear goal of starving our resources of markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta NDP government promised that imposing a carbon tax on Albertans would buy so-called <b>social license</b>
 in B.C. for a pipeline to the Pacific. We are baffled that the Alberta 
government bought this specious argument, since it's their fellow 
travellers - both the B.C. NDP and radical environmental activists such 
as Tzeporah Berman - who are leading the fight against the approved 
Trans Mountain expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surely, the Alberta NDP 
understood that their friends would not be willing to trade a carbon tax
 for a pipeline. In fact, Premier Rachel Notley finally acknowledged 
this reality in a recent interview with <span class="companylink">CBC Radio</span>.
 When asked why not put a hold on the carbon tax until the pipeline 
begins construction, she responded, "quite honestly, I don't know that 
B.C. would care one way or another if we did that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The truth is that the 
Trudeau Liberals provided paper regulatory approval for the pipeline, 
purportedly because of Alberta's willingness to impose a carbon tax on 
its citizens. Yet today, the Trudeau Liberals are willing to do little 
beyond rhetoric to fight for Trans Mountain in the face of vociferous 
opposition in B.C., hurting the 51 First Nations that have signed off in
 support of the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's in all Albertans 
interest to see this pipeline succeed. We in the United Conservative 
Party welcome the government's recent about face. After months mocking 
our suggestions to threaten the B.C. NDP with serious consequences, 
including potentially cutting off <b>oil</b> shipments and tolling B.C. natural gas, the premier has finally accepted our advice, albeit far too late.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We welcome a robust, 
serious debate on what's needed to get this pipeline built. But we 
should not be deluded into the fantasy that punitive taxes on everyday 
Albertans will appease the fringe yet extremely vocal anti-pipeline 
minority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, we must make it 
clear to the vast majority of reasonable Canadians that the success of 
our energy sector is critical for the success of our country, and that 
Alberta cannot be taken for granted any longer.</p>

 they might be ideologically opposed on various issues, right-of-centre 
Brad Wall, former Saskatchewan premier, is in “totally support” of 
left-leaning Alberta Premier Rachel Notley’s promise to do whatever it 
takes to see the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion come to fruition, 
even if it means shutting off the flow of <b>oil</b> and gas to B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That would get a lot of 
attention, as a last resort, if the people in the province of Alberta 
said: ‘Alright, we are going to try and show you just how important 
these pipelines are to you economically, and to the quality of life for 
B.C. and for the rest of the country,’” he told a Calgary Chamber of 
Commerce luncheon event on Monday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Just as a has-been premier, I would cheer from the sidelines if it needs to be done.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, during his 
speech and onstage Q&amp;A session with W.Brett Wilson, Wall also 
emphasized differences he has with Alberta’s NDP government, as well as 
with the current federal Liberal government. The long-time head of the 
conservative <span class="companylink">Saskatchewan Party</span> 
discussed his concerns regarding what he calls the “new left,” which 
seems to place matters such as (what he considers) ineffective carbon 
pricing ahead of government’s primary concern — the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The problem with this 
carbon tax is that you’d be hard pressed to find it working to actually 
reduce emissions, absolutely, where it is implemented. In our own 
country, it has been around since 2008 in the province next door, and 
their emissions are up. Now, B.C. would say: ‘Wait a minute. The 
intensity of the emissions is down.’ But [the Paris Agreement] isn’t 
about intensity of emissions; Paris is about absolute emissions 
reductions.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall’s presentation to 
the chamber was his first public address since leaving office following a
 decade as premier. Earlier this year, the governing party chose Scott 
Moe as Saskatchewan’s new premier (DOB, Jan. 29, 2018).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Wall, 
federal documents suggest the carbon tax must reach $200 per tonne for 
Canada to meet those Paris Agreement targets. While that would reduce 
emissions, he noted, such a price would do so only with widespread 
hardship through such results as many people being unable to afford to 
drive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That’s where the emperor has no clothes. That’s the discussion we need to have.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: “Federally, in 
terms of the economy priorities, we’ve seen a carbon-based budget, we’ve
 seen a gender-based budget, but I long for the day for our country when
 we see an economy-based budget.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall asks: What is <b>social license</b>?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever “<b>social license</b>”
 means, Wall believes the energy sector paid for it long ago, and 
industry does not require a carbon tax to justify its existence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was paid for in the 
transfer payments that were supported because of [Alberta’s] economy and
 ours,” he told reporters following this week’s chamber event. “It was 
paid for in jobs for Canadians from coast to coast to coast, and the 
quality of life implications of that. That’s <b>social license</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It has been paid for in 
meaningful land partnerships with First Nations, who built 
transformational businesses and created jobs because of this sector. All
 of this sounds like <b>social license</b> to me.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall believes this “self-immolation of a carbon tax” — whereby Alberta and Saskatchewan punish themselves because of their <b>oil</b>
 and gas assets — is ineffective anyway. It will not win support from 
those who are anti-industry, he said, as those individuals will still 
support ENGOs, they will still vote in accordance to their pre-carbon 
tax views, and they will still pressure their governments to act in 
accordance with anti-industry sentiments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If someone from B.C. or some other part of the country doesn’t like the <b>oil</b> and gas sector, the fact you implement a carbon tax is not going to change that person’s opinion.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: “This is something that has frustrated me since the very beginning.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technology to tackle climate change</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Focus on developing 
technology rather than on carbon pricing: That is Wall’s proposed 
‘made-in-Canada’ solution to man-made climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Could we as a country 
have a ‘man-to-the-moon’ sort of approach of finding a way to lower the 
cost of what we are already doing in [Saskatchewan] in terms of clean 
coal technology? That is our experience at home. The technology works; 
we have to drive the costs down. Isn’t it more important to do that and 
perhaps provide a technological solution that would actually reduce 
emissions?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the former 
premier, there are 2,000 coal plants being built around the world, 
principally in Asia, as countries such as India strive to grow their 
economies. He suggested carbon taxation has taken hold in Canada, in 
part, because various sectors of the economy hesitated to point out that
 pricing does not reduce absolute emissions, but it does have an impact 
on jobs. He challenges Canadians to stand up against ineffective policy 
that hurts competitiveness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In our province, it 
wasn’t good enough just to say we weren’t going to have a carbon tax. We
 unveiled in the fall our action plan on climate change, and it is a 
serious plan. It’s meaningful. It includes the possibility of a levy on 
high emitters, the likes of which you have had in Alberta.”</p>

the results of its December 31, 2017 Reserves Assessment and Evaluation 
of its <b>oil</b> and natural gas properties (the “Report”), as evaluated by <span class="companylink">McDaniel &amp; Associates Consultants Ltd</span>.(“McDaniel”) with an effective date of December 31, 2017, prepared in accordance with the standards contained in the Canadian <b>Oil</b> and Gas Evaluation Handbook (the “COGE Handbook”) and National Instrument 51-101 – Standards of Disclosure for <b>Oil</b> and Gas Activities ( “NI 51-101”).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Our 
reserve growth reflects the active drilling program at Kakwa this year 
and the light <b>oil</b> acquisition at Antler. Corporate proved and 
probable reserves gross reserves grew by 20% or 3.22 MMBoe from 15.7 
MMBoe to 18.41 MMBoe, net of production during the year. The before tax 
NPV-10% estimated for the corporate proved and probable reserves using 
McDaniel’s year-end price forecast is $174.70 million.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commenting on Questerre’s
 Utica resources in Quebec, he added, “The reserve engineers updated our
 resource report from last year for their current price forecast. The 
best estimate of risked contingent resources net to Questerre for the 
Becancour and Lotbiniere project areas is unchanged at 214 Bcf. These 
project areas as assessed only cover 5% of our total acreage. The risked
 net present value discounted at 10% before tax for this limited 
development area is $301 million compared to $311 million last year.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credit Facility</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company also reported
 on the status of its credit facility review that was conducted in the 
fourth quarter of 2017. The lender has advised that the primary credit 
facility will be renewed at $18 million. The facility will include a 
$17.9 million revolving operating demand facility (“Credit Facility A”).
 Credit Facility A can be used for general corporate purposes, ongoing 
operations and capital expenditures within Canada.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">December 31, 2017 Quebec Resource Information</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questerre also reported on the year-end update prepared by <span class="companylink">GLJ Petroleum Consultants Ltd</span>.
 (“GLJ”) to the independent resource assessment of its 735,910 gross 
(190,800 net) acres in the St. Lawrence Lowlands Quebec that have 
potential for the Upper Utica Shale effective December 31, 2017 in a 
report dated March 5, 2018 (the “GLJ Resource Assessment”). The GLJ 
Resource Assessment was prepared in accordance with NI 51-101 and the 
standards contained in the COGE Handbook. The GLJ Resource Assessment 
did not include any of the Corporation’s other properties. All 
anticipated results disclosed herein were prepared by GLJ, which is an 
independent qualified reserves evaluator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GLJ used probabilistic 
methods to generate low, best and high estimates of total petroleum 
initially in-place ("TPIIP"), both discovered and undiscovered. 
Recoverable Contingent and Prospective Resources over Questerre's 
acreage were estimated by analogy and based on available well data over 
the Quebec Utica and public data from US Utica and Marcellus shale 
plays. The evaluation consisted of the Upper Utica which includes the 
Indian Castle and Dolgeville members as well as the Flat Creek. The Flat
 Creek, the lower most member, was only evaluated to estimate 
undiscovered petroleum initially-in-place ("UPIIP"). No recoverable 
resources were assigned to the Flat Creek given the lack of test data 
showing established technology can support commercial development at 
this time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GLJ Resource 
Assessment is based on the results from several vertical and horizontal 
wells on the Questerre’s acreage that have all encountered pay in the 
Utica. Test data from these wells in conjunction with offset development
 and studies of the analogous US Utica supports the prospective 
commercial development of these resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Significant positive 
factors relevant to the estimate of Questerre’s resources include the 
importation of all natural gas consumed in Quebec creating demand for 
local production, premium realized pricing due to the transportation 
costs associated with importing natural gas for consumption, production 
test data from Questerre’s existing wells and the development of the 
analogous Utica shale in the United States. Significant negative factors
 include the limited number of wells on Questerre’s acreage, lack of a 
developed service sector providing uncertainty regarding estimates of 
capital and operating costs, developing hydrocarbon regulations and 
environmental legislation and the requirement to obtain social 
acceptability for <b>oil</b> and gas operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Questerre believes 
it will have sufficient financial capability to fund its share of costs 
associated with the development program in the GLJ Resource Assessment, 
it may not have access to the necessary capital when required. 
Conducting the development program is also dependent on the 
participation by Questerre’s joint venture partners. There is no 
guarantee that they will elect to participate in the program to the 
extent required. Questerre retains the right to conduct activities 
without the operators’ participation on an independent operations basis 
whereby it can fund 100% of the capital costs for certain well 
operations and facilities in return for net revenue equal to 400% of its
 capital investment before the operators can elect to either remain in a
 penalty position or hold a working interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The TPIIP was determined 
probabilistically on a permit basis with estimates of 45 to 145 Bcf per 
square mile for the Upper Utica. This compares favorably to analogous US
 shale plays with estimates of the Utica in Ohio at between 35 to 85 Bcf
 per square mile and 25 to 150 Bcf per square mile for the Marcellus 
shale in Pennsylvania. Of the TPIIP estimated over Questerre’s acreage, 
only land within a 3 mile radius of a successfully tested well was 
quantified as discovered gas-in-place. Based on this qualification only 
16% of the total mapped TPIIP in the Upper Utica was considered 
discovered Contingent Resource.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Upper Utica was 
considered undiscovered for approximately 84% of the total mapped TPIIP.
 Recovery factors of 18%, 26% and 37% were applied to the low, best and 
high estimates resource cases respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Summary information 
regarding contingent resources and net present value of future net 
revenues from contingent resources are set forth below and are derived, 
in each case, from the GLJ Resource Assessment. All contingent resources
 evaluated in the GLJ Resource Assessment were deemed economic at the 
effective date of December 31, 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questerre’s average 
working interest in its gross best estimate Contingent Resources is 
25.9%. In addition to Questerre’s working interest, the Company also 
holds a royalty interest in the acreage and associated resources. As a 
result, in some cases Questerre’s net volumes (after royalties) exceed 
its working interest volumes. For clarity, included in the following 
tables are Questerre’s volume before royalties, gross working interest 
volumes and net volumes after royalties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A range of contingent 
resources estimates (low, best and high) were prepared by GLJ. See notes
 5 to 7 of the tables below for a description of low estimate, best 
estimate and high estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GLJ Resources 
Assessment estimated gross risked contingent resources with a project 
maturity subclass of development on hold of 18.6 million boe (low 
estimate) to 50.0 million boe (high estimate), with a best estimate of 
30.4 million boe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GLJ Resources 
Assessment estimated gross risked contingent resources with a project 
maturity subclass of development unclarified of 8.9 million boe (low 
estimate) to 23.8 million boe (high estimate), with a best estimate of 
14.6 million boe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estimate of risked net
 present value of future net revenue of contingent resources is 
preliminary in nature and is provided to assist the reader in reaching 
an opinion on the merit and likelihood of the Company proceeding with 
the required investment. It includes contingent resources that are 
considered too uncertain with respect to the chance of development to be
 classified as reserves. There is uncertainty that the risked net 
present value of future net revenue will be realized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent resources can 
be sub-classified based on their project maturity sub-class which help 
identify a project’s change of commerciality. The project maturity 
subclasses for contingent resources are “development pending”, 
“development on hold”, “development unclarified” or “development not 
viable”, all as defined in the COGE Handbook. “Development pending” is 
when resolution of the final conditions for development is being 
actively pursued (high chance of development). “Development on hold” is 
when there is a reasonable chance of development, but there are major 
non-technical contingencies to be resolved that are usually beyond the 
control of the operator. “Development unclarified” is when the 
evaluation is incomplete and there is ongoing activity to resolve any 
risks or uncertainties. “Development not viable” is when no further data
 acquisition or evaluation is currently planned and hence there is a low
 chance of development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those areas classified as
 development on hold are primarily contingent on the passage of 
applicable hydrocarbon and environmental legislation and regulations as 
well as local acceptability. Remaining areas classified as development 
unclarified have additional contingency or risk associated with securing
 <b>social license</b> to operate and are thereby a lower priority for 
development. Additional contingencies include firm development plans, 
detailed cost estimates and corporate approvals and sanctioning. There 
is no certainty that any portion of the Contingent Resources will be 
economic to develop. Though pilot horizontal development plans have been
 proposed, the project evaluation scenario for the Contingent Resources 
is not sufficiently defined to make an investment decision to proceed to
 development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources are 
evaluated based on the same fiscal conditions used in the assessment of 
reserves, and as such, are forecasted to be economic. Contingent 
Resource values are estimated on the basis of established technology, 
namely multistage hydraulic fracturing recovery technologies that are 
widely used in the development of shale gas plays including in the 
Montney in Canada and the Utica formation in Ohio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chance of 
commerciality for Contingent Resources is equal to the product of the 
chance of discovery and the chance of development. “Chance of discovery”
 is the estimated probability that exploration activities will confirm 
the existence of a significant accumulation of potentially recoverable 
petroleum. “Chance of development” is the estimated probability that, 
once discovered, a known accumulation will be commercially developed. 
Based on contingencies related to the passage of applicable hydrocarbon 
and environmental legislation, regulations, local acceptability, and 
additional risk associated with securing <b>social license</b> to 
operate, firm development plans, detailed cost estimates and corporate 
approvals GLJ estimated the Chance of Development for the development 
unclarified subclass ranges between 10% and 25% as detailed in the table
 below. By definition the chance of discovery for Contingent Resource is
 100%. The corresponding chance of commerciality for the development 
unclarified subclass is therefore estimated at between 10% and 25% as 
detailed in the table below.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notes:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Contingent resources 
are defined in the COGE Handbook as those quantities of petroleum 
estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from known 
accumulations using established technology or technology under 
development, but which are not currently considered to be commercially 
recoverable due to one or more contingencies. There is no certainty that
 it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the contingent
 resources or that Questerre will produce any portion of the volumes 
currently classified as contingent resources. The estimates of 
contingent resources involve implied assessment, based on certain 
estimates and assumptions, that the resources described exists in the 
quantities predicted or estimated, as at a given date, and that the 
resources can be profitably produced in the future. The risked net 
present value of the future net revenue from the contingent resources 
does not represent the fair market value of the contingent resources. 
Actual contingent resources (and any volumes that may be reclassified as
 reserves) and future production therefrom may be greater than or less 
than the estimates provided herein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* GLJ prepared the 
estimates of contingent resources shown for each property using 
deterministic principles and methods. Probabilistic aggregation of the 
low and high property estimates shown in the table might produce 
different total volumes than the arithmetic sums shown in the table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* "Gross” contingent 
resources are Questerre's working interest (operating or non-operating) 
share before deduction of royalties and without including any royalty 
interests of Questerre. "Net” contingent resources are Questerre's 
working interest (operating or non-operating) share after deduction of 
royalty obligations, plus Questerre's royalty interests in contingent 
resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The risked net present 
value of future net revenue attributable to the contingent resources 
does not represent the fair market value of the contingent resources. 
Estimated abandonment and reclamation costs have been included in the 
evaluation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Low Estimate Contingent
 Resources are considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity 
that will actually be recovered. It is likely that the actual remaining 
quantities recovered will exceed the low estimate. If probabilistic 
methods are used, there should be at least a 90 percent probability 
(P90) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the 
low estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Best Estimate 
Contingent Resources are considered to be the best estimate of the 
quantity that will actually be recovered. It is equally likely that the 
actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the 
best estimate. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at 
least a 50 percent probability (P50) that the quantities actually 
recovered will equal or exceed the best estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* High Estimate 
Contingent Resources are considered to be an optimistic estimate of the 
quantity that will actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual
 remaining quantities recovered will exceed the high estimate. If 
probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 10 percent 
probability (P10) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or 
exceed the high estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Chance of 
Development (CoDev) is the estimated probability that, once discovered, a
 known accumulation will be commercially developed. Five factors have 
been considered in determining the CoDev as follows:CoDev = Ps (Economic
 Factor) × Ps (Technology Factor) × Ps (Development Plan Factor) ×Ps 
(Development Timeframe Factor) × Ps (Other Contingency Factor) wherein 
Ps is the probability of successEconomic Factor – For reserves to be 
assessed, a project must be economic. With respect to contingent 
resources, this factor captures uncertainty in the assessment of 
economic status principally due to uncertainty in cost estimates and 
marketing options. Economic viability uncertainty due to technology is 
more aptly captured with the Technology Factor. The Economic Factor will
 be 1 for reserves and will often be 1 for development pending projects 
and for projects with a development study or pre-development study with a
 robust rate of return. A robust rate of return means that the project 
retains economic status with variation in costs and/or marketing plans 
over the expected range of outcomes for these variables.Technology 
Factor - For reserves to be assessed, a project must utilize established
 technology. With respect to contingent resources, this factor captures 
the uncertainty in the viability of the proposed technology for the 
subject reservoir, namely, the uncertainty associated with technology 
under development. By definition, technology under development is a 
recovery process or process improvement that has been determined to be 
technically viable via field test and is being field tested further to 
determine its economic viability in the subject reservoir. The 
Technology Factor will be 1 for reserves and for established technology.
 For technology under development, this factor will consider different 
risks associated with technologies being developed at the scale of the 
well versus the scale of a project and technologies which are being 
modified or extended for the subject reservoir versus new emerging 
technologies which have not previously been applied in any commercial 
application. The risk assessment will also consider the quality and 
sufficiency of the test data available, the ability to reliably scale 
such data and the ability to extrapolate results in time.Development 
Plan Factor – For reserves to be assessed, a project must have a 
detailed development plan. With respect to contingent resources, this 
factor captures the uncertainty in the project evaluation scenario. The 
Development Plan Factor will be 1 for reserves and high, approaching 1, 
for development pending projects. This factor will consider development 
plan detail variations including the degree of delineation, reservoir 
specific development and operating strategy detail (technology decision,
 well layouts (spacing and pad locations), completion strategy, start-up
 strategy, water source and disposal, other infrastructure, facility 
design, marketing plans etc) and the quality of the cost estimates as 
provided by the developer.Development Timeframe Factor – In the case of 
major projects, for reserves to be assessed, first major capital 
spending must be initiated within 5 years of the effective date. The 
Development Timeframe Factor will be 1 for reserves and will often be 1 
for development pending projects provided the project is planned 
on-stream based on the same criteria used in the assessment of reserves.
 With respect to contingent resources, the factor will approach 1 for 
projects planned on-stream with a timeframe slightly longer than the 
limiting reserves criteria.Other Contingency Factor – For reserves to be
 assessed, all contingencies must be eliminated. With respect to 
contingent resources, this factor captures major contingencies, usually 
beyond the control of the operator, other than those captured by 
economic status, technology status, project evaluation scenario status 
and the development timeframe. The Other Contingency Factor will be 1 
for reserves and for development pending projects and less than 1 for on
 hold. Provided all contingencies have been identified and their 
resolution is reasonably certain, this factor would also be 1 for 
development unclarified projects.These factors may be inter-related 
(dependent) and care has been taken to ensure that risks are 
appropriately accounted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Contingent resources 
for the Lowlands have been estimated based the results from several 
vertical and horizontal wells on the Company’s acreage that have all

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Summary information 
regarding prospective resources and net present value of future net 
revenues from prospective resources are set forth below and are derived,
 in each case, from the GLJ Resources Assessment. The GLJ Resources 
Assessment was prepared in accordance with COGE Handbook and NI-51-101 
by GLJ, an independent qualified reserve evaluator. All prospective 
resources evaluated in the GLJ Resources Assessment were deemed economic
 at the effective date of December 31, 2017. Prospective resources are 
in addition to reserves estimated in the GLJ Report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Upper Utica was 
considered undiscovered for approximately 84% of the total mapped TPIIP.
 Recovery factors of 19%, 27% and 40% were applied to the low, best and 
high estimates resource cases respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A range of prospective 
resources estimates (low, best and high) were prepared by GLJ. See notes
 6 to 8 of the tables below for a description of low estimate, best 
estimate and high estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GLJ Resources 
Assessment estimated gross risked prospective resources of 87 million 
boe (low estimate) to 238 million boe (high estimate), with a best 
estimate of 143 million boe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chance of 
commerciality for Prospective Resources is equal to the product of the 
chance of discovery and the chance of development. “Chance of discovery”
 is the estimated probability that exploration activities will confirm 
the existence of a significant accumulation of potentially recoverable 
petroleum. “Chance of development” is the estimated probability that, 
once discovered, a known accumulation will be commercially developed. 
Based on contingencies related to the passage of applicable hydrocarbon 
and environmental legislation, regulations, local acceptability, and 
additional risk associated with securing <b>social license</b> to 
operate, firm development plans, detailed cost estimates and corporate 
approvals GLJ estimated the Chance of Development at 19 percent. 
Proximity to extensional and compressional-related fault systems 
presents risk of structuring resulting in leak off and reduced pressures
 in some prospective regions, additionally, lack of delineation data 
provides reservoir risk associated with uncertainty regarding reservoir 
quality and rock mechanics amicable to hydraulic fracturing. Therefore, 
GLJ has estimated the Chance of Discovery at 81 percent. The 
corresponding chance of commerciality is 15 percent. This also takes 
into account Questerre’s working interest and operatorship of its assets
 as Questerre is subject to the priorities of working interest partners 
for such assets. Production and development forecasts were not completed
 by GLJ as part of the prospective resources evaluation.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notes:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Prospective resources 
are defined in the COGE Handbook as those quantities of petroleum 
estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from 
unknown accumulations by application of future development projects. 
Prospective resources have both an associated chance of discovery 
(CoDis) and a chance of development (CoDev). There is no certainty that 
any portion of the prospective resources will be discovered. If 
discovered, there is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to
 produce any portion of the prospective resources or that Questerre will
 produce any portion of the volumes currently classified as prospective 
resources. The estimates of prospective resources involve implied 
assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the 
resources described exists in the quantities predicted or estimated, as 
at a given date, and that the resources can be profitably produced in 
the future. The risked net present value of the future net revenue from 
the prospective resources does not represent the fair market value of 
the prospective resources. Actual prospective resources (and any volumes
 that may be reclassified as reserves) and future production therefrom 
may be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* GLJ prepared the 
estimates of prospective resources shown for each property using 
deterministic principles and methods. Probabilistic aggregation of the 
low and high property estimates shown in the table might produce 
different total volumes than the arithmetic sums shown in the table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The forecast price and 
cost assumptions utilized in the year-end 2017 reserves report were also
 utilized by GLJ in preparing the GLJ Resource Assessmen</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* "Gross” prospective 
resources are Questerre’s working interest (operating or non-operating) 
share before deduction of royalties and without including any royalty 
interests of the Company. "Net” prospective resources are Questerre’s 
working interest (operating or non-operating) share after deduction of 
royalty obligations, plus Questerre’s royalty interests in prospective 
resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The risked net present 
value of future net revenue attributable to the prospective resources 
does not represent the fair market value of the prospective resources. 
Estimated abandonment and reclamation costs have been included in the 
evaluation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Low Estimate 
Prospective Resources is considered to be a conservative estimate of the
 quantity that will actually be recovered. It is likely that the actual 
net remaining quantities recovered will exceed the low estimate of 87 
million boe. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least
 a 90 percent probability (P90) that the quantities actually recovered 
will equal or exceed the low estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Best Estimate 
Prospective Resources is considered to be the best estimate of the 
quantity that will actually be recovered. It is equally likely that the 
actual net remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than 
the best estimate of 143 million. If probabilistic methods are used, 
there should be at least a 50 percent probability (P50) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the best estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The High Estimate 
Prospective Resources is considered to be an optimistic estimate of the 
quantity that will actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual
 net remaining quantities recovered will exceed the high estimate of 238
 million boe. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at 
least a 10 percent probability (P10) that the quantities actually 
recovered will equal or exceed the high estimate.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This news release 
contains certain statements which constitute forward-looking statements 
or information (“forward-looking statements”) including its estimated 
future net revenues, price forecasts and the filing of an Annual 
Information Form. In addition, statements relating to reserves and 
resources are deemed to be forward-looking ?statements ?as they involve 
the implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that
 the reserves and resources described exist in the quantities predicted 
or estimated and can be profitably produced in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forward-looking 
statements are based on a number of material factors, expectations or 
assumptions of Questerre which have been used to develop such statements
 and information but which may prove to be incorrect. Although Questerre
 believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking 
statements are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on them 
because Questerre can give no assurance that they will prove to be 
correct. Since forward-looking statements address future events and 
conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks and 
uncertainties. Further, events or circumstances may cause actual results
 to differ materially from those predicted as a result of numerous known
 and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors, many of which are 
beyond the control of the Company, including, without limitation: 
whether the Company's exploration and development activities respecting 
its prospects will be successful or that material volumes of petroleum 
and natural gas reserves will be encountered, or if encountered can be 
produced on a commercial basis; the ultimate size and scope of any 
hydrocarbon bearing formations on its lands; that drilling operations on
 its lands will be successful such that further development activities 
in these areas are warranted; that Questerre will continue to conduct 
its operations in a manner consistent with past operations; results from
 drilling and development activities will be consistent with past

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All evaluations and 
reviews of future net revenue are stated prior to any provision for 
interest costs or general and administrative costs and after the 
deduction of estimated future capital expenditures for wells to which 
reserves have been assigned. The estimated future net revenue from the 
production of disclosed <b>oil</b> and gas reserves does not represent 
the fair market value of the Company’s reserves. There is no assurance 
that such price and cost assumptions will be attained and variances 
could be material. The recovery and reserve estimates of crude <b>oil</b>,
 NGLs and natural gas reserves provided herein are estimates only and 
there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered. 
Actual light and medium crude <b>oil</b>, shale gas and natural gas 
liquids reserves may be greater than or less than the estimates provided
 herein. All of the Company’s light and medium crude <b>oil</b>, shale gas and natural gas liquids reserves are located in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barrel of <b>oil</b> 
equivalent (“boe”) amounts may be misleading, particularly if used in 
isolation. A boe conversion ratio has been calculated using a conversion
 rate of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of <b>oil</b>
 and the conversion ratio of one barrel to six thousand cubic feet is 
based on an energy equivalent conversion method application at the 
burner tip and does not necessarily represent an economic value 
equivalent at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the 
current price of crude <b>oil</b> as compared to natural gas is 
significantly different from the energy equivalent of 6:1, utilizing a 
conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estimates of reserves
 and future net revenue for individual properties may not reflect the 
same confidence level as estimates of reserves and future net revenue 
for all properties, due to the effects of aggregation.</p>

 (“Questerre” or the “Company”) (TSX:QEC) (OSE:QEC) announced today that
 it has entered into an agreement with an experienced operator to 
develop its 100% acreage in the Kakwa area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, President and Chief Executive Officer of Questerre, 
commented, “The first well at Kakwa North should spud next quarter, 
subject to rig availability. Given the strong condensate production and 
low sour content from nearby wells on our joint venture acreage we are 
looking forward to the results.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He further added, “With 
this joint venture we are developing our operated acreage and preserving
 capital primarily for Quebec. We are working on our Quebec Clean Gas 
pilot as we wait for the release of the final regulations later this 
spring.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The farm-in partner is an
 exploration and production company with extensive operating experience 
with the Montney Formation in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subject to the terms of 
the agreement, the farm-in partner has the right to drill, complete, 
equip and tie-in two horizontal wells targeting the Montney Formation to
 earn a 50% interest in certain acreage held by Questerre at Kakwa 
North. The partner has the option to drill, complete, equip and tie-in 
additional wells to earn a similar interest in other acreage held by 
Questerre at Kakwa North and Kakwa South. Questerre will hold a royalty 
interest in these initial wells and certain subsequent wells subject to 
standard payout provisions. Questerre currently holds a 100% interest in
 4,480 acres at Kakwa North along with 3,840 acres at Kakwa South and a 
25% interest in 10,240 acres on its joint venture block.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questerre also reported 
on plans for additional activity targeting its shallow mineral rights, 
above and excluding Montney rights, at Kakwa North. The Company was 
recently advised by the operator that it plans to drill up to six 
horizontal wells on this acreage in 2018. Questerre holds an overriding 
royalty interest in 4160 acres of shallow rights at Kakwa North.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questerre Energy Corporation</span> is 
leveraging its expertise gained through early exposure to shale and 
other non-conventional reservoirs. The Company has base production and 
reserves in the tight <b>oil</b> Bakken/Torquay of southeast 
Saskatchewan. It is bringing on production from its lands in the heart 
of the high-liquids Montney shale fairway. It is a leader on <b>social license</b> to operate issues for its Utica shale gas discovery in the St. Lawrence Lowlands, Quebec. It is pursuing <b>oil</b> shale projects with the aim of commercially developing these massive resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questerre is a believer that the future success of the <b>oil</b>
 and gas industry depends on a balance of economics, environment and 
society. We are committed to minimizing our footprint wherever possible,
 being transparent and are respectful that the public must be part of 
making the important choices for our energy future.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OK, so let me see if I've got this right: After three years of raising taxes on <b>oil</b>
 companies and everyone who works in the patch (plus just about everyone
 else in Alberta), after the carbon tax, a 50% increase in the tax on 
large industrial emitters, the coal shutdown, the hard cap on oilsands 
emissions and a pile of other red tape and regulations on the <b>oil</b>
 industry, the Notley government announces $1 billion in grants and 
loans guarantees for bitumen upgraders and we're all supposed to be 
blown away by their commitment to Alberta's energy industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By modest estimates, Alberta has lost between $30 billion to $35 billion in <b>oil</b>
 and gas investment since the NDP nightmare began in May 2015, and now 
the Notley government wants Albertans to be grateful that it is putting 
$1 billion back into the industry over eight years.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without doubt, much of the lost investment was due to the downturn in world <b>oil</b> prices and to the fact that we cannot get pipelines built that will take our <b>oil</b> to international markets - neither of which is the fault of the NDP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's not as if we are losing out to developing countries in the investment race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We certainly are losing out to places such Egypt and Kazakhstan and Tanzania.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But mostly we are losing 
out to jurisdictions that are the most like Alberta: Texas, Oklahoma, 
North Dakota. We are losing out to places where the geology and the 
financial landscapes are similar to Alberta. Often in the past, when 
they've boomed we've boomed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we are being passed 
by now, while they surge ahead, in large part because our New Democrats 
have been operating under the ridiculous belief that if we could just 
beggar ourselves with environmental regulations and taxes, we could buy "<b>social license</b>" that would cause "green" politicians and environmentalists to grant us permits to build pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And after that strategy 
has turned out to be such a spectacular failure, the NDP think Albertans
 can be bought off with an investment of $125 million a year for eight 
years to "diversify" our <b>oil</b> and gas sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industrial goal of 
the Notley government's diversification strategy, released Monday is 
sound. Indeed, it's clever and practical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Get a few upgraders built
 that don't fully refine oilsands bitumen, but rather upgrade it part 
way. That reduces the need to add diluent to the bitumen, which means 
more bitumen can fit down a pipeline and there is no need to remove 
diluent at the other end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP also want to see 
more liquification of natural gas done in Alberta so our methane and 
other gases can be shipped more easily to west coast terminals. That's 
all very sensible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the NDP hadn't 
sucked (taxed) so much money out of the patch already (not to mention 
discouraging so much investment and destroying so many jobs), maybe they
 wouldn't have to put back a billion dollars they don't have, just to 
try to stimulate some "diversification."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We should do some 
valueadded processing of our natural resources here, rather than always 
shipping our raw resources down a pipeline to be refined and turned into
 usable products somewhere else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was always shortsighted of former Tory governments not to get more refineries and upgraders built when the price of <b>oil</b> was high and environmental opposition was low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Give the NDP credit for 
taking a step in that direction. But maybe they won't have to spend tax 
dollars trying to force upgraders into existence if they hadn't 
undermined the energy sector so thoroughly in the first place.</p>

heartily loved and duly respected by our Canadian peers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nope, that naïve dream 
died on the vine. Instead, we've seen how the rest of Canada will 
merrily take our teeth and come back for the gaping gums when it comes

 wasn't supposed to be this way. Not when our premier introduced her 
much-vaunted carbon tax - not in an election campaign, mind you, but 
after the NDP was somewhat unexpectedly ensconced in power. Back then, 
Rachel Notley waxed lyrical about the benefits of imposing this "levy" 
on us rubes while shutting down our nasty coal industry, capping 
emissions from the oilsands and sending out environmental missionaries 
bearing gifts of free light bulbs and the wherewithal to screw them into
 our sockets. Ouch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It began well enough - 
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was giggly and gung-ho at telling the 
world "Canada is back" and pulling its weight in the fight to slow 
global warming. Heck, at one point, early on in this dreary debacle, 
Alberta and Notley even got a shout out from Barack Obama himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, that was after
 he'd repeatedly stuck a presidential fork into the Keystone XL pipeline
 project aimed at boosting the amount of our <b>oil</b> traveling through his country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, those were the days. 
Yet, like a prairie summer, they didn't last. Soon, Notley got a 
reminder winter was a-coming, and not because she was watching Game of 
Thrones on <span class="companylink">Netflix</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First to put the boot into this brave new world of <b>social license</b>, where we'd scratch the environmental inch and in turn have our tummies tickled in getting <b>oil</b> to tidewater, was Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">La belle province placed 
so many obstacles into the path of the Energy East pipeline project 
aimed at taking crude to the Atlantic coast that <span class="companylink">TransCanada Corp</span>. eventually called it quits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now it's British 
Columbia's turn, using the same endless delays to thwart the Trans 
Mountain extension project, despite construction being given a federal 
nod.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's left Trudeau 
twisting in the wind, so no wonder he's merrily messing about in India, 
even if no one there is that keen to greet him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, we've got the 
now-notorious wine ban. Glory be - whatever next? Maybe a B.C. salmon 
boycott? There are so many billions of dollars at stake for the province
 and country that such weak symbolism is akin to taking a penknife to a 
gunfight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nope, if we want to see action, it's time to kick into gear the anti-<b>social license</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It goes like this. First,
 we're ditching the carbon tax. Next, we're reversing the mothballing of
 our coal industry that threatened the existence of so many Alberta 
towns and, finally, that cap on emissions - well, poof, it's gone. David

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In
 October 2016, Prime Minister Trudeau's announcement that Canadian 
provinces would be required to adopt carbon pricing was met with wide 
political agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both the United States 
and China had recently agreed to the Paris climate accord, and 
provincial governments in Canada's three largest provinces had already 
committed to some form of carbon pricing.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta,
 home of Canada's most abundant oilsands and a traditional bastion of 
conservative support, had broken with decades of Progressive 
Conservative leadership, electing an NDP government that presented 
carbon pricing as a critical part of the <b>oil</b> industry's <b>social license</b>
 to export its products to market. Across the country, Liberal 
provincial governments held power. Conservatives were at a historically 
low ebb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former Prime Minister 
Harper's inability to adequately address climate change had hurt 
perceptions of Canadian resources; a new approach was needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What a difference 16 
months make. Alberta is locked in a battle with its provincial 
counterparts in British Columbia over the Trans Mountain Pipeline. While
 the federal government has expressed support for the project, the 
provincial governments are no longer in the same agreeable position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Albertans, who have long 
memories of the misguided National Energy Program devised by Pierre 
Elliott Trudeau's government, are increasingly conscious of the 
oilsands' vulnerabilities and are strongly resistant to any measures 
that may diminish its growth. Enter Jason Kenney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Breaking from years of 
the Alberta Progressive Conservative Party's efforts to court a bigger 
tent of voters, the former Harper cabinet minister has united the 
province's right-wing forces under a series of unapologetically 
conservative stances, including strident opposition to the carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As this takes place, action and rhetoric from the Trump administration has added pressure to Canadian <b>oil</b> producers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Prime Minister Trudeau and President Barack Obama struck similar tones about building <b>social license</b> for <b>oil</b> extraction, Trump has a drastically different vision for competitiveness, unlocking millions of jobs by slashing regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suddenly, carbon pricing is facing serious political headwinds as conservatives across Canada spring into action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some Conservatives 
briefly toyed with Michael Chong's plan for a revenue neutral carbon 
tax, Andrew Scheer won the leadership race by promising to scrap carbon 
pricing. He rejects the premise that taxes can fight climate change and 
has ardently emphasized their impact on affordability. The recent 
political climate has only contributed to his resolve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has allies. With 
Trump's election, the Liberal's newly created Canadian Energy Regulator 
and the harsh impact of the oilsands downturn on our national 
productivity, carbon pricing is beginning to feel like too much too soon
 for many Canadians. And in an era where political conversations are 
increasingly framed around affordability, the added burden of taxes has 
become problematic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This explains the recent 
shift in Ontario politics. Former Progressive Conservative Party of 
Ontario leader Patrick Brown shocked pundits and delegates alike when he
 announced his support for a revenue neutral carbon tax in March 2016. 
Many pundits saw this as a critical point in national discussions around
 carbon pricing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But his swift removal as 
leader has provided a window for anti-carbon pricing advocates to 
rebound in Ontario. While there may have been no appetite for such a 
position in 2016, leadership candidates are now willing to fight against
 carbon taxation in spades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All three leading 
leadership candidates for the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario 
have promised to oppose cap and trade, carbon taxation and any former of
 carbon pricing in no uncertain terms. Call it pandering. Call it 
impractical. But it represents a growing and formidable opposition from 
the most likely candidates to take over as premier of Canada's largest 
province this June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To add to that, 
Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe threatened that Trudeau's government 
would enforce the carbon tax on his province over “[his] dead body.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's clear is that 
after several years of standing down on the issue of the carbon tax, 
conservative parties and politicians are no longer willing to sit idly 
by and allow the Liberals to steer the agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's problematic for 
the federal government is that in many provinces, those same vocal 
opponents look to be set on a path to power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as the political 
tides have turned on this issue before, it seems they have once again — 
at least amongst the conservative base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result? Prime Minister Trudeau has a fight on his hands.</p>

Mr. Chris Bruijnzeels reports</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHAMARAN ANNOUNCES 25% INCREASE IN ATRUSH RESERVES ESTIMATES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Shamaran Petroleum Corp</span>. has increased by 25 per cent its estimated proven plus probable (2P) <b>oil</b>
 reserves for the Atrush block as of Dec. 31, 2017, after accounting for
 Atrush 2017 production. Reserves and contingent resources estimates 
were provided by <span class="companylink">McDaniel &amp; Associates Consultants Ltd</span>.
 ("McDaniel"), the Company's independent qualified resources evaluator, 
and were prepared in accordance with standards set out in the Canadian 
National Instrument NI 51-101 and Canadian <b>Oil</b> and Gas Evaluation Handbook (COGEH).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Chris Bruijnzeels, President and CEO of ShaMaran, commented: "These 
year-end reserve estimates demonstrate the world class nature of the 
Atrush field. Total Field Proven plus Probable ("2P") Reserves on a 
property gross basis for Atrush increased from 85.1 MMbbl to 102.7 MMbbl
 which, when 2017 Atrush production of 3.4 MMbbl is included, represents
 an increase of 25 percent. Total Field Unrisked Best Estimate 
Contingent <b>Oil</b> Resources ("2C") on a property gross basis for 
Atrush remained essentially the same at around 296 MMbbl, resulting in 
an overall increase in Atrush best estimate resources of 5%. Our 2018 
work program aims to move more of the contingent resources into 
reserves."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McDaniel's estimates 
reflect the encouraging production results from the Atrush field 
following start of production in July 2017, as well as the positive 
drilling results of Chiya Khere-7 well which found the top of the 
reservoir 114 meters higher to prognosis. McDaniel's reserves estimates 
assume that four extra production wells will be drilled to further 
develop the medium gravity <b>oil</b> in the reserves area of the field, increasing medium <b>oil</b> recovery. Reserves associated with the heavy <b>oil</b>
 extended well test planned in 2018 for the Chiya Khere-6 well have also
 been included. Reserves which were included in McDaniel's previous 
estimate for heavy <b>oil</b> production from the wells currently 
producing have now been transferred to Contingent Resources because 
production to date has shown no indication of heavy <b>oil</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(1)This estimate of

Notes: 
(1)Based on a 20.1 percent Company working interest share of the property gross resources.
(2)There is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the resources.
(3)The Atrush Field contains crude <b>oil</b> of variable density. Fluid type is classified according to
   COGEH: Light/Medium <b>Oil</b> is based on density less than 920 kg/m3 and Heavy <b>Oil</b> is between 920 and
   1000 kg/m3.
(4)These are unrisked contingent resources that do not account for the chance of development which
   is defined as the probability of a project being commercially viable. Quantifying the chance of
   development requires consideration of both economic contingencies and other contingencies, such
   as legal, regulatory, market access, political, <b>social license</b>, internal and external approvals
   and commitment to project finance and development timing. As many of these factors are extremely
   difficult to quantify, the chance of development is uncertain and must be used with caution. The
   chance of development was estimated to be 80 percent for the Crude <b>Oil</b> and 5 percent for the
   Natural Gas.
(5)The contingent resources are sub-classified as "development unclarified" with an "undetermined"
   economic status.

Chris Bruijnzeels, President and CEO of ShaMaran, commented: "These 
year-end reserve estimates demonstrate the world class nature of the 
Atrush field.&nbsp;Total Field Proven plus Probable ("2P") Reserves on a
 property gross basis for Atrush increased from 85.1 MMbbl to 102.7 
MMbbl which, when 2017 Atrush production of 3.4 MMbbl is included, 
represents an increase of 25 percent. Total Field Unrisked Best Estimate
 Contingent <b>Oil</b> Resources ("2C") on a property gross basis for 
Atrush remained essentially the same at around 296 MMbbl, resulting in 
an overall increase in Atrush best estimate resources of 5%. Our 2018 
work program aims to move more of the contingent resources into 
reserves."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McDaniel's estimates 
reflect the encouraging production results from the Atrush field 
following start of production in July 2017, as well as the positive 
drilling results of Chiya Khere-7 well which found the top of the 
reservoir 114 meters higher to prognosis. McDaniel's reserves estimates 
assume that four extra production wells will be drilled to further 
develop the medium gravity <b>oil</b> in the reserves area of the field, increasing medium <b>oil</b> recovery. Reserves associated with the heavy <b>oil</b>
 extended well test planned in 2018 for the Chiya Khere-6 well have also
 been included. Reserves which were included in McDaniel's previous 
estimate for heavy <b>oil</b> production from the wells currently 
producing have now been transferred to Contingent Resources because 
production to date has shown no indication of heavy <b>oil</b>.</p>

<span class="companylink">Sherritt International Corporation</span> 
("Sherritt" or the "Corporation") (TSX: S), a world leader in the mining
 and hydrometallurgical refining of nickel and cobalt from lateritic 
ores, today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and 
year ended December 31, 2017. All amounts are in Canadian currency 
unless noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CEO COMMENTARY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sherritt ended 2017 with
 a significantly strengthened balance sheet and a much improved outlook 
as a result of a number of key developments over the past year," said 
David Pathe, President and CEO of Sherritt International. "Most notably,
 we completed the restructuring of the Ambatovy Joint Venture, achieved 
our nickel and cobalt production as well as our unit cost targets at the
 Moa Joint Venture, and benefitted from higher realized prices for each 
of the primary commodities that we produce."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pathe added, "We have
 sustained this momentum since the start of 2018 with our first equity 
financing in more than a decade, and are currently conducting a modified
 Dutch auction tender process to reduce our debt even further. With the 
strong outlook for Class 1 nickel and cobalt given electric vehicle 
market trends and the maturities on our outstanding debentures not due 
until the fourth quarter of 2021, we are particularly encouraged by our 
prospects in 2018 and beyond."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q4 HIGHLIGHTS </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">   -- Sherritt and its partners successfully completed the restructuring of the 
      Ambatovy Joint Venture. Following the restructuring, Sherritt eliminated 
      $1.4 billion in debt from its balance sheet, retained a 12% ownership 
      interest in Ambatovy and continues to serve as operator. 
 
   -- Net direct cash cost (NDCC)(1) at the Moa Joint Venture ("Moa JV") was 
      US$1.80 per pound of finished nickel sold, the lowest total since the 
      third quarter of 2004. The decline was primarily driven by higher cobalt 
      prices and the US$0.50 per pound cost savings achieved with the 
      commissioning of the third acid plant at Moa in the fourth quarter of 
      2016. 
 
   -- Sherritt's share of finished nickel production at the Moa JV was 4,134 
      tonnes, up 9% from Q4 2016, while its share of finished cobalt was 465 
      tonnes, up 22% from Q4 2016. Production increased on a year-over-year 
      basis despite the negative impact heavy rains had on lowering mixed 
      sulphide production in November and December 2017. 
 
   -- Received $19.9 million from the Moa JV as repayment on its working 
      capital facility and US$7.5 million in Cuban energy payments. 
 
   -- Adjusted EBITDA was $49.6 million, up 33% from Q4 2016. 
 
   -- Including a gain of $629.0 million related to the Ambatovy restructuring, 
      earnings were $537.8 million, or $1.80 per share outstanding, up from a 
      net loss of $106.7 million, or $0.36 per share outstanding, in Q4 2016. </pre>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2017 HIGHLIGHTS </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">   -- Sherritt ended the year with cash, cash equivalents and short-term 
      investments of $203.0 million after reflecting payments related to the 
      Ambatovy JV restructuring, interest payments related to outstanding 
      debentures and the $35.0 million repayment of a syndicated revolving-term 
      loan. 
 
   -- Sherritt's share of finished nickel and finished cobalt production at the 
      Moa JV were 15,762 tonnes and 1,801 tonnes, respectively. The production 
      totals were in line with guidance for the year. 
 
   -- NDCC at the Moa Joint Venture was US$2.35 per pound of finished nickel, 
      below the US$2.80 - $3.30 per pound guidance that the Company provided 
      for the year. 
 
   -- Adjusted EBITDA was $149.8 million, up from $40.0 million in 2016. 
 
   -- Including the gain related to the Ambatovy JV restructuring, net earnings 
      were $293.8 million, or $0.99 per share outstanding, up from a net loss 
      of $378.9 million, or $1.29 per share outstanding, in 2016. 
 
   -- Sherritt's efforts to strengthen its balance sheet were reflected in a 
      number of improved financial ratios at year end. Net debt to Adjusted 
      EBITDA reduced from 48.9 at the end 2016 to 4.4 at December 31, 2017 
      while total debt to shareholders' equity improved from 2.1 at the end of 
      2016 to 0.8 at December 31, 2017.(2) </pre>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HIGHLIGHTS SUBSEQUENT TO YEAR END </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">   -- Closed a unit offering financing transaction that generated gross 
      proceeds of $132.0 million. Net proceeds will be used to reduce 
      Sherritt's outstanding indebtedness, for general corporate purposes and 
      to fund future growth initiatives. 
 
   -- Launched a modified Dutch Auction tender offer to repurchase up to $75.0 
      million of outstanding unsecured debentures. The tender offering is 
      expected to close on February 16, 2017. 
 
   -- Executed a three-year extension of the Puerto Escondido/Yumuri production 
      sharing contract to 2021. 
 
   -- Although facilities at the Ambatovy Joint Venture in Madagascar were 
      impacted by Tropical Cyclone Ava, a Category 2 hurricane equivalent storm, 
      all personnel were unhurt and safely accounted for. Damage to equipment 
      and the acid production facilities resulted in a temporary halt in 
      production. Repairs have since been completed and partial production has 
      resumed. A ramp up in production is expected through the end of Q2 2018. </pre>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(1) For additional information see the Non-GAAP measures section of this press release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(2) Net debt is defined 
as debt due within one year plus the book value of long-term debt, less 
cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, as shown in 
Sherritt's consolidated statement of financial position. Total debt is 
defined as debt due within one year plus the book value of long-term 
debt plus the non-recourse debt. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Q4 2017, Sherritt 
generated negative cash flow from operations of $33.9 million. The 
consolidated total included $32.5 million in positive cash flow 
contributions from the Moa JV and Fort Site and $5.4 million in positive
 cash flow contributions from the Power division. Total transaction 
costs of $11.3 million related to the restructuring of the Ambatovy JV 
contributed negatively to the consolidated total.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash, cash equivalents 
and short-term investments at year end were $203.0 million, down from 
$290.3 million at September 30, 2017. The decrease was primarily driven 
by payments related to the restructuring of the Ambatovy JV, lower Cuban
 energy payments received and the repayment of $8.0 million in Q4 on the
 Company's syndicated revolving-term loan and partly offset by a $19.9 
million repayment from the Moa JV on its working capital facility to 
Sherritt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During Q4, US$7.5 million
 of Cuban energy payments were received compared to US$32.6 million in 
the third quarter of 2017. Total Cuban overdue receivables were US$132.6
 million at December 31, 2017 compared to US$100.5 million at September 
30, 2017. The increase in overdue receivables was attributable to a 
number of factors, including the impact of Hurricane Irma and resulting 
recovery costs on Cuba's economy. Sherritt has experienced variability 
in its Cuban receivables over the years but has not incurred any losses 
related to any Cuban receivables.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">METAL MARKETS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nickel</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nickel prices rallied in 
the second half of 2017 after experiencing considerable volatility in 
the first six months of the year. The average nickel reference price in 
the fourth quarter was US$5.25 per pound, up 7% from US$4.90 for Q4 
2016. The average nickel reference price for the 12-months of 2017 was 
US$4.72 per pound, up 8% from US$4.36 per pound for 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year-over-year price 
improvements were largely driven by the growing understanding of the 
important role that Class 1 nickel will play in the burgeoning electric 
vehicle (EV) market. Class 1 nickel, along with cobalt, are key elements
 needed to manufacture EV batteries. Demand for Class 1 nickel and 
cobalt are expected to grow significantly beginning in 2019 when China 
expects to begin production quotas requiring that 10% of all vehicles 
manufactured be electric.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During Q4, the nickel 
price was supported by news that nickel pig iron (NPI) producers in 
China were asked to reduce production to alleviate pollution with 
China's largest NPI-only producer ordered to halve production from 
November 2017 to March 2018. Actual and anticipated reductions from 
existing nickel producers also continued to help underpin the nickel 
price, with nickel supply expected to be in a deficit for 2018 and 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nickel reference price improvements in the second half were also driven by the decline in inventories. Combined <span class="companylink">LME</span>
 and SHFE nickel inventories at year-end declined to 410,828 tonnes 
(from 464,696 tonnes at the beginning of the year). Any further decline 
in visible inventories could give momentum to nickel price increases in 
the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cobalt</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cobalt prices 
strengthened considerably in 2017. The average reference price in the 
fourth quarter was US$31.60 per pound for 2017, up 134% from Q4 2016. 
The average reference cobalt price for the 12-month period of 2017 was 
US$26.53, up 125% from US$11.77 per pound for 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price increase is 
primarily linked to the growing strong demand emanating from the EV 
battery market. The double-digit price growth experienced over the past 
year was also driven by geopolitical and supply risk concerns given that
 the Democratic Republic of Congo is currently the world's largest 
source of cobalt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As cobalt prices have a 
limited impact on overall battery pack costs, high prices are not 
expected to cause supply-chain disruptions or delay EV market growth. As
 a result, the risk of cobalt substitution in EV battery production in 
the near term is relatively low given cobalt's unique energy 
transference properties. While battery manufacturers continue to explore
 alternatives to cobalt, the likely beneficiary of any substitution is 
expected to be Class 1 nickel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cobalt supply deficits 
are expected to continue over the next few years. In addition to demand 
from industrial end users, speculative investors are also driving up 
cobalt prices by stockpiling inventory, further exacerbating supply 
deficit concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moa Joint Venture (50% interest) and Fort Site (100%)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Moa JV produced 4,134
 tonnes of finished nickel in Q4 2017, up from 3,782 tonnes produced in 
Q4 2016, despite mixed sulphides production being negatively impacted by
 abnormally heavy rainfalls in November and December 2017. Finished 
nickel production on a 12-month basis was 15,679 tonnes in 2017, in line
 with expectations for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q4 2017 revenue for the 
Moa JV and the Fort Site totaled $123.0 million, up 32% from $92.5 
million last year. The growth was driven by higher production and higher
 realized prices for nickel, cobalt and fertilizer. Nickel sales 
represented 50% of total Q4 2017 revenue while cobalt sales represented 
33%. Fertilizer sales in Q4 2017 were up 19% from last year, reflecting 
stronger demand and higher realized prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mining, processing and 
refining (MPR) costs for Q4 2017 were US$4.89 per pound, down from 
US$4.93 per pound for Q4 2016. The decline was largely due to higher 
production volumes in Q4 2017. MPR costs on the full-year basis were 
US$4.80 per pound for 2017, up from US$4.63 per pound for 2016. The 
US$0.17 increase per pound in 2017 was attributable to higher energy 
costs, although partly offset by cost savings of approximately US$0.50 
per pound achieved with the commissioning of the third acid plant at Moa
 in the fourth quarter of 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite higher energy and
 sulphur input costs, Moa's NDCC of US$1.80/lb of finished nickel in Q4 
2017 was the lowest experienced since Q3 2004. The cobalt credit of 
US$3.54/lb reflects Moa's high cobalt to nickel production ratio as well
 as the 125% growth in cobalt prices since Q4 2016. NDCC improvement 
also benefited from the commissioning of a third sulphuric acid plant at
 Moa in 2016 that generated approximate savings of US$0.50/lb. NDCC on a
 12-month basis was $2.35/lb, down from $3.42/lb for 2016. NDCC for 2017
 was significantly lower than expectations for the year, due largely to 
higher cobalt by-product credits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash provided by 
operations in Q4 2017 totaled $32.5 million, up from a loss in Q4 2016 
when Hurricane Matthew and the subsequent collapse of bridge 
infrastructure negatively impacted production. Cash flow from operations
 in Q4 2017 was also positively impacted higher realized nickel and 
cobalt prices..</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moa's sustaining capital 
spending in Q4 2017 was $7.7 million, up from $4.7 million in Q4 last 
year. The increase was attributable to the timing of expenditures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ambatovy Joint Venture (12% interest effective December 11, 2017)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with its partners, 
Sherritt completed the restructuring of the Ambatovy Joint Venture on 
December 11, 2017. The restructuring led to Sherritt's ownership 
interest being reduced to 12% in exchange for the elimination of $1.4 
billion of debt. Sherritt's financial and operational results at 
Ambatovy are presented on a 40% basis to December 10, 2017 and on a 12% 
basis effective December 11, 2017. Sherritt will continue to serve as 
operator of Ambatovy at least through 2024, however, as a result of the 
reduction in its ownership interest, Sherritt's ability to direct local 
decision-making at Ambatovy has diminished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finished nickel 
production at Ambatovy in Q4 2017 was 3,111 tonnes, down from 5,111 
tonnes for the comparable period of 2016, which represented Ambatovy's 
highest ever production total. The year-over-year decline was due to a 
number of developments that impacted plant reliability. Most notably, 
the failure of an economizer in one of the acid plants reduced 
production capacity to approximately 50% during November and December of
 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finished nickel 
production on a 12-month basis for 2017 was 13,618 tonnes, down from 
16,842 tonnes for 2016. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to 
equipment failures that reduced the reliability of Ambatovy's acid plant
 and pressure acid leach circuit. Maintenance activities and replacement
 of equipment completed in 2017 are expected to improve plant 
reliability and production stability over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finished cobalt 
production in Q4 2017 was 245 tonnes, down from 404 tonnes for the same 
period of 2016. The decrease was tied to plant reliability issues 
previously cited that lowered production. Cobalt production for 2017 was
 1,173 tonnes, down from 1,309 tonnes for 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MPR costs for Q4 2017 
were US$5.76 per pound, up from US$3.97 per pound in Q4 2016. MPR costs 
on a full-year basis were US$6.01 per pound in 2017, up from US$4.89 per
 pound in 2016. The year-over-year increases were largely due to higher 
input costs as well as lower production volumes in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NDCC for finished nickel 
at Ambatovy in Q4 2017 was $3.26/lb, up from the $3.10/lb for Q4 2016. 
The increase was due to lower production, higher maintenance costs, 
higher energy and sulphur input costs offset by higher cobalt by-product
 credits. NDCC on a 12-month basis $3.83/lb for 2017, down from $4.27/lb
 for 2016. Ambatovy's NDCC for 2017 places it slightly above the 50(th) 
percentile of industry average cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subsequent to year end, 
facilities at the Ambatovy Joint Venture were impacted by Tropical 
Cyclone Ava, a Category 2 hurricane equivalent storm. Damage to 
equipment and the acid production facilities resulted in a temporary 
halt in production. Repairs have since been completed and partial 
production has resumed. A ramp up in production is expected through the 
end of Q2 2018.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Power production in Q4 
2017 was 201 gigawatt hours ("GWh") of electricity, down 10% from 224 
GWh for the comparable period of 2016. The decline was largely due to 
reduced gas supply. Power production on a 12-month basis was 848 GWh for
 2017, down from 894 GWh for 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average realized prices 
in Q4 2017 declined to $54.01 per Megawatt hour ("MWh') of electricity 
from $56.24 per MWh in Q4 2016. The decline was due to the appreciation 
of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. currency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue in Q4 2017 
totaled $12.0 million, down 15% from $13.7 million for Q4 2016. The 
decrease is attributable to lower production and lower realized prices. 
Revenue on a full-year basis was $51.2 million, down from $58.6 million 
for 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash flow from operations in Q4 2017 grew by 264% to $5.3 million due to changes in working capital in the quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unit operating cost in Q4
 2017 was $23.43 per MWh of electricity, down 5% from $24.73 per MWh for
 Q4 2016. The decrease was due principally to reduced maintenance 
activities at the Boca and Puerto Escondido facilities this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total capital spending in
 Q4 2017 was $0.1 million, down from $0.4 million for the comparable 
period of last year. For the full year, the decline in capital spending 
was primarily due to the absence of service concession spending this 
year.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 annual Energy New Ventures competition effectively deconstructs the 
myth that innovation isn't happening in the energy sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is. And it's happening
 in the startup ecosystem, driven by individuals who might once have 
worked within the giant corporate energy infrastructure but are now on 
the outside and seeking to do things better, faster and cheaper.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's fifth annual competition, sponsored by the <span class="companylink">University of Calgary</span>'s
 Hunter Hub for Entrepreneurial Thinking, saw companies pitch ideas to 
tackle some of the grand challenges facing the oilpatch. Those would 
include everything from emissions management and water treatment to the 
use of data analytics to optimize production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A day earlier, the issue 
of energy sector innovation was raised by Kelly Craft, the U.S. 
Ambassador to Canada, and Canadian Ambassador to the U.S. David 
MacNaughton during a discussion hosted by the <span class="companylink">Energy Council of Canada</span> in Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Craft highlighted how innovation and technology has unlocked <b>oil</b>
 and natural gas reserves in the U.S. She also mentioned - several times
 - the importance of research and innovation to the energy future of the
 continent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Innovation is something 
Canada, the United States and Mexico have agreed is critical to further 
North America's vast energy resources," said Craft, while relating how <span class="companylink">Natural Resources Canada</span> officials recently visited the U.S. National Lab in Berkley, Calif. to explore future opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She went on to tout the economic benefits, backed by research from consulting firm <span class="companylink">IHS</span> that demonstrated how every state is benefiting from growth in the energy sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's an observation 
British Columbians and Premier John Horgan need to understand. They, 
too, benefit from Alberta's energy sector, as does all of Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower prices for energy - means a better price at the pumps for consumers and as feedstocks for petrochemical plants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a bit of an unintended slap, however, when Craft referenced how <span class="companylink">Nova Chemicals</span>
 is investing in its Ontario petrochemical plant after securing a 
low-cost feedstock - natural gas from the Utica and Marcellus plays 
south of the border.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That one hurt. It should be natural gas from the west supplying that plant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Craft also emphasized the
 Trump administration's efforts to streamline the permitting process for
 new infrastructure to capitalize on the economic opportunity. That 
particular message seems to get lost in Canada, especially between B.C. 
and Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's ambassador picked up the thread of innovation and the need for progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I do not believe in 
going backwards, but I think we face so many challenges ... not just in 
the energy sector," said MacNaughton. "By standing still, we will fall 
behind. I am more ambitious. There are new challenges that we face in 
the energy world ... that means that we do need to update what we are 
doing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We also need to 
collaborate a lot more on how we get ... community acceptance for things
 like pipelines and major infrastructure."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two ambassadors, 
along with presenters at the Energy New Ventures event, also expressed 
the need to move away from the "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" 
mentality that's pervasive in terms of trade and energy companies 
experimenting with new technology and processes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latter has gotten better, largely due to the <b>oil</b>
 price collapse that forced change within the sector. Yet there still 
remains a view that innovation means doing the same thing, only cheaper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also interesting to 
hear from those pushing the innovation boundaries that the differences 
between the speed at which decisions are made to try new technologies in
 the U.S. versus in Canada. The consensus is there's a greater appetite 
in the U.S. to take risks associated with a new idea, process or 
technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That raises a number of 
questions, including whether some of the disincentive lies in the 
regulatory approval process. There is also the practical matter of how 
the innovators survive, even when they have a viable process or idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One challenge is that big
 companies make investment decisions that can stretch out over decades. 
The startup or tech company wants to sign a deal in the short term, to 
either validate a process or technology, or because they're ready to 
launch their product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There remains a 
disconnect between the sense of urgency to support continued innovation -
 that makes the sector strong, and helps to give it the necessary '<b>social license</b>'- and the long term investment horizons of companies in a position to adopt new technologies but reticent to take the risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The energy sector has been disrupted by technology. Without it the U.S. wouldn't have reached record <b>oil</b>
 production, as it did last week. The challenge is to be part of the 
next wave of disruption - and not left watching from the sidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, companies 
that pitched their ideas to private equity and venture capital investors
 from Calgary and Vancouver reflected the activity taking place within 
the oilpatch and make the sector more competitive and able to address 
the environmental challenges. It's also working to align its values with
 a younger demographic, whose talent it will need in the near future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was an encouraging 
window into what's happening - and what's possible. Deborah Yedlin is a

certainty is especially pressing for AME’s members, which includes more

reported $247 million in exploration spending in B.C. last year. The 
figure is higher than the $205 million spent in 2016, but well below the
 nearly $700 million spent in 2011–2012.</p>

Justin Trudeau has the jurisdiction to push back B.C.'s new threat to 
block the Trans Mountain pipeline, but does he have the will?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Prime Minister hoped 
he had done the politics on pipelines in 2016, long before an election, 
balancing approval of an expansion of the pipeline to Burnaby, B.C., 
with a price on carbon and a climatechange agreement with provinces. But
 the mess is back, and that spells trouble for Mr. Trudeau.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">British
 Columbia's NDP government, which depends on Green Party support to 
survive, announced a review of whether a bitumen spill could be properly
 cleaned up – and said it would regulate to block any increase the flow 
of bitumen through the province and onto tankers until that review is 
completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If this were just a 
jurisdictional fight between B.C. and Ottawa, it would be pretty easy 
for Mr. Trudeau to push back. B.C. has powers to regulate its 
environment, but approving pipelines, and the inter-provincial 
transportation of resources such as <b>oil</b>, is federal jurisdiction.
 The pipeline is supposed to meet provincial rules, but if B.C. is using
 them to frustrate the federal government's powers, it would have a hard
 time making its case in court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this is politics. Mr.
 Trudeau has to worry that if he picks a fight with B.C., it shines the 
spotlight on his approval of the Trans Mountain pipeline. That just 
brings up a decision that is unpopular with environmentally conscious 
Liberal voters, and with some of the constituents of Liberalheld ridings
 in the Lower Mainland. The Liberals wanted the controversy to cool 
down, not fire up as the 2019 election gets closer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Alberta Premier 
Rachel Notley called an emergency cabinet meeting on Wednesday and 
threatened legal action if B.C. tries to prevent the flow of more 
bitumen, federal Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr was mum, standing 
pat on a terse statement he issued on Tuesday. That statement said the 
Liberal government stands by its approval of the pipeline – but did not 
warn B.C. it does not have the power to obstruct the decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Notley's government 
wants Ottawa to make a stronger statement. “Alberta also expects the 
federal government to stand up and defend the constitution and its 
significance to the economic stability of the country," Cheryl Oates, 
Ms. Notley's director of communications, said in an e-mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were already significant court challenges filed by First Nations and 157 conditions that pipeline promoter <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd</span>.
 had to meet. The B.C. government has every right to review whether it 
is really feasible to clean up a spill of diluted bitumen. But their 
right to apply environmental protections is likely to stop at Ottawa's 
power to approve pipelines. Among the plans, according to B.C.'s 
backgrounder, is to broaden its authority over marine affairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ottawa has the sole power to regulate the navigation and shipping of the <b>oil</b>
 tankers that would carry the diluted bitumen, said Dalhousie University
 law professor Aldo Chircop, a professor of maritime law at Dalhousie 
University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the moment, B.C. has 
not said just how it proposes to regulate to prevent an increase in the 
amount of bitumen that flows through the province, but almost any 
effective measure is likely to meet a pretty stiff challenge from those 
who insist it is Ottawa's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having jurisdiction does 
not help Mr. Trudeau with his political problem, though. He thought he 
had finessed the issue in 2016 by promising to balance approval of the 
pipeline with climate action. Mr. Trudeau and Ms. Notley argued that 
climate policy was supposed to help provide the “<b>social license</b>" for <b>oil</b>
 sands development and pipelines. Mr. Trudeau also got the government of
 former BC Liberal premier Christy Clark to buy in by pumping 
$1.5-billion into an ocean protection plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That neat piece of work 
is unravelling now. B.C. Premier John Horgan is already facing tension 
with his Green Party partner Andrew Weaver over approval of the Site C 
dam and apparent interest in liquefied natural gas projects. He has to 
talk tough on Trans Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trudeau, meanwhile, 
cannot just ditch his promise to make sure Canadian resources get to 
market – that was the balance between development and environment he 
promised. But it is politically dangerous to act too tough with a B.C. 
government that argues it is protecting its citizens against 
environmental risks, especially as an election gets nearer.</p>

 &nbsp;("Pulse" or the "Company") (TSX-V: PUL) reports today on the 
independent resource assessment (the "Resource Assessment") of the 
Company's Nisku Enhanced <b>Oil</b> Recovery ("EOR") project in the Bigoray area of Alberta ("Bigoray").</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estimate, completed by <span class="companylink">Sproule Associates Limited</span>
 ("Sproule"), an independent qualified reserves evaluator, with an 
effective date of&nbsp;December 6, 2017, includes the Bigoray EOR 
project potential only, and is in addition to the previously disclosed 
baseline independently assessed reserves in the Company's core areas at 
Bigoray and Queenstown.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Resource Assessment was prepared in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 – Standards of Disclosure for <b>Oil</b> and Gas Activities&nbsp;of the Canadian Securities Administrators ("NI 51-101") and the Canadian <b>Oil</b>
 and Gas Evaluation Handbook ("COGE Handbook"). Sproule assessed a best 
estimate Discovered Petroleum Initially in-Place of 23.292 million 
barrels of <b>oil</b> ("boe") within Pulse's 100% controlled Nisku D and Nisku E Pools, which Pulse views as being conservative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the Resource
 Assessment provides estimates categorized as "high", "best" and "low" 
for contingent resources associated with the Bigoray EOR project on the 
two pools, with the unrisked high estimate being 8.07 million boe (92.6%
 <b>Oil</b>), a best estimate of 6.136 million boe (91.3% <b>Oil</b>) and a low estimate of 3.668 million boe (89.1% <b>Oil</b>).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, the 
Resource Assessment prepared by Sproule calculated risked contingent 
resources where the risked assessment assigned a 77% chance of Pulse 
proceeding with the EOR project (see Table 2 below) and resulting in a 
best estimate of risked contingent resources net to Pulse of 4.694 
million boe (91.2% <b>Oil</b>).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Cadenhead, Chief 
Operating Officer of Pulse, commented, "The Sproule Resource Assessment 
is a positive independent commercial confirmation for our Bigoray Nisku 
Enhanced <b>Oil</b> Recovery project. Although this assessment used a 
more conservative approach to Petroleum Initially in-Place ("PIIP") 
compared with the PIIP estimates of the Alberta Energy Regulator, we are
 excited to see that even this more conservative approach resulted in a 
strong endorsement for the project. With an independent un-risked high 
case upside estimated at over 8 million boe's of contingent resources 
(92% <b>oil</b>), the opportunity to move forward with our EOR project 
to&nbsp; bring on stream substantial cashflow while targeting to recover
 those types of <b>oil</b> volumes without drilling a well, creates a substantial opportunity to enhance value for Pulse and our shareholders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Resource Assessment 
focussed exclusively on two Nisku pools only in the Bigoray area, and 
included just 2,720 acres of Pulse's 44,720 acre core area holdings 
which includes 14,000 acres at Bigoray alone. Future evaluations may be 
done on Pulse's Mannville, Cardium and Pekisko formations that are 
thought to also provide significant growth opportunities for the Company
 as well as additional Nisku assets/pools held within Pulse's existing 
holdings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cadenhead further 
added, "As part of the Resource Assessment, the evaluator assessed a 
total risk of 77% that the project would proceed, citing economic 
factors and/or timing of development as one of the only risks associated
 with the project. All technical risks such as evaluation drilling, 
regulatory approvals, technology, legal factors, infrastructure and 
markets, political factors and social licence were all assigned 100% 
chance of commerciality.&nbsp;Our goal is to make this project happen in
 2018 and with the <b>oil</b> price market appreciating heading into 
2018, the economics of this EOR project and return for shareholders 
continue to look more and more attractive alongside improving <b>oil</b> prices." &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Resource Assessment 
is based on the results from seventeen wells and, where available, core 
data. Where core was not available, the assessment considered log data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resource 
volumes for these discovered resources have been classified as 
'development unclarified' with Sproule assessing that there is a high 
probability of the Bigoray EOR project becoming a commercial 
development. Pulse will continue to complete project planning associated
 with the project and move forward with its execution plans in 
2018.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resource Definitions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resources encompasses all
 petroleum quantities that originally existed on or within the earth's 
crust in naturally occurring accumulations, including Discovered and 
Undiscovered (recoverable and unrecoverable) plus quantities already 
produced. "Total Resources" is equivalent to "Total Petroleum Initially 
In-Place". Resources are classified in the following categories:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total Petroleum Initially
 In-Place ("TPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is estimated to 
exist originally in naturally occurring accumulations. It includes that 
quantity of petroleum that is estimated, as of a given date, to be 
contained in known accumulations, prior to production, plus those 
estimated quantities in accumulations yet to be discovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovered Petroleum 
Initially In-Place ("DPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is 
estimated, as of a given date, to be contained in known accumulations 
prior to production. The recoverable portion of DPIIP includes 
production, reserves, and Contingent Resources; the remainder is 
unrecoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources are 
those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established 
technology or technology under development but which are not currently 
considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more 
contingencies. Economic Contingent Resources (ECR) are those contingent 
resources that are currently economically recoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undiscovered Petroleum 
Initially In Place ("UPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is 
estimated, on a given date, to be contained in accumulations yet to be 
discovered. The recoverable portion of UPIIP is referred to as 
Prospective Resources and the remainder is unrecoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective Resources are
 those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application 
of future development projects. Prospective Resources have both an 
associated chance of discovery and a chance of development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unrecoverable is that 
portion of DPIIP and UPIIP quantities which is estimated, as of a given 
date, not to be recoverable by future development projects. A portion of
 these quantities may become recoverable in the future as commercial 
circumstances change or technological developments occur; the remaining 
portion may never be recovered due to the physical/chemical constraints 
represented by subsurface interaction of fluids and reservoir rocks. 
Uncertainty Ranges are described by the Canadian <b>Oil</b> and Gas Evaluation Handbook as low, best, and high estimates for reserves and resources as follows:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low Estimate: This is 
considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities
 recovered will exceed the low estimate. If probabilistic methods are 
used, there should be at least a 90 percent probability (P90) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the low estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best Estimate: This is 
considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will actually be
 recovered. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities 
recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate. If 
probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50 percent 
probability (P50) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or 
exceed the best estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High Estimate: This is 
considered to be an optimistic estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual remaining 
quantities recovered will exceed the high estimate. If probabilistic 
methods are used, there should be at least a 10 percent probability 
(P10) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the 
high estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development Unclarified 
is a project maturity sub-class of contingent resources that refers to 
the development plan evaluation is not complete and there is ongoing 
activity to resolve any risks or uncertainties.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certain resource estimate
 volumes disclosed herein are arithmetic sums of multiple estimates of 
DPIIP or UPIIP, which statistical principles indicate may be misleading 
as to volumes that may actually be recovered. Readers should give 
attention to the estimates of individual classes of resources and 
appreciate the differing probabilities of recovery associated with each 
class as explained under this&nbsp;Resource Definitions&nbsp;section.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In
 a perverse kind of way, this week's 50-per-cent increase in Alberta's 
unpopular carbon tax - to $30 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions - 
could be a big gift from Rachel Notley's NDP government to her opponent,
 United Conservative Party (UCP) opposition leader Jason Kenney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase means the province now ties British Columbia for having the highest carbon tax in the country.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in Alberta it stings as the province uses more energy for heating and transportation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost in a typical 
Alberta household of a $30 a tonne tax is $667 a year, compared to $362 
in the typical B.C. household, according to a study by Jennifer Winter, 
an energy economist at the University of Calgary's school of public 
policy. At $50 a tonne, the annual cost is $1,111 in Alberta and $603 in
 B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's no small change in a
 lousy provincial economy with high unemployment. Polls consistently 
show strong disapproval of the tax, which piles on top of higher taxes 
and increased environmental regulations that are depressing job creation
 in the <b>oil</b> and gas sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's hefty carbon 
tax is one of the big pieces of the province's climate leadership plan, 
pushed through by Notley's government when Alberta's conservatives were 
in disarray and political implications seemed remote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question is whether 
Albertans embrace the tough medicine and its benefits, as claimed by the
 government, or will slam the door on the tax grab when they return to 
the polls next year. That's what the UCP, which reunited conservatives 
last year and picked Kenney to lead them, is counting on. Meanwhile, the
 duelling views are clashing hard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">University of Calgary 
economics professor Trevor Tombe said the carbon tax is controversial 
because it's visible in heating bills and at the pumps and because of 
its negative economic impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even government estimates show it shrinks GDP and deters employment, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the plan, the tax 
increases to $50 a tonne by 2022 to line up with federal goals. But 
other provinces are taking longer to ramp up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carbon is priced at $19 a tonne in the cap and trade market in Quebec and Ontario.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Provinces without carbon 
pricing are subject to the federal carbon price, which starts at $10 per
 tonne in 2018 and rises by $10 per year to $50 per tonne in 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta NDP says the benefits of its carbon tax include economic diversification away from <b>oil</b> and gas, job creation from greener jobs, emissions reductions, tax rebates for those with lower incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, green job creation hasn't offset the estimated 100,000 <b>oil</b> and gas jobs lost over the last three years, partly due to Alberta's climate change plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cheryl Oates, 
communications director for Notley, said 2,000 jobs have been created 
from energy efficiency programs so far and another 1,300 jobs are 
expected. The recently announced winning bidders of renewable 
electricity projects are expected to create another 740 jobs, with 7,000
 jobs overall expected in new renewable energy by 2030.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province estimates it
 will collect $1.038 billion in revenue from the tax in fiscal 2017-18, 
rising to $1.396 billion in 2018-2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All revenue from carbon 
pricing is reinvested back into Alberta's economy to reduce emissions, 
support renewable energy and help Alberta families and businesses adjust
 to the price of carbon," said Oates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government also 
argues that even with the increase in carbon pricing, Alberta has an 
overall tax advantage compared to other provinces because it has no 
provincial sales tax, health premium or payroll tax. It estimates 
Albertans and Alberta businesses will still pay at least $8.7 billion 
less in total taxes and carbon charges than if the province had the same
 tax system and carbon pricing as other provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney says he would 
immediately repeal the "job killing tax" if elected premier - and at the
 same time put a big dent in the federal government's own climate change
 plan, which relies on Alberta toeing the line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Alberta families and 
jobcreators have suffered enough under this NDP government, and now they
 have to endure a 50 per cent increase in a carbon tax that hasn't 
converted a single opponent of Alberta's energy industry into a 
supporter," Kenney said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The carbon tax was supposed to buy '<b>social license</b>'for
 pipelines to get built. Instead, since the NDP announced its plan, 
Justin Trudeau vetoed approved Northern Gateway, Barack Obama vetoed 
Keystone XL, the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span> 
effectively killed Energy East, and the NDP government in B.C. is doing 
everything it can to block TransMountain. Not one single government, 
party, or special interest group has gone from 'no'to 'yes'on pipelines 
as a result of the NDP's failed tax on everything."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the trend continues, 
and the two remaining pipeline projects aren't built, Notley would hand 
her political opponents another big gift by showing the tax is all pain 
and no gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this time, the odds 
are hard to call because the future of both Keystone XL and the Trans 
Mountain expansion depend on the resolution of legal disputes with 
opponents. Financial Post ccattaneo@nationalpost.com</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 Canadian natural resources industry is undergoing enormous change. 
Volatile energy prices — the reality of US 55 per barrel — reduced 
production reliability, uncertain market access, the government’s 
climate change agenda, tightening environmental policy, safety, and 
compliance concerns along with increasing social drivers, such as <b>social license</b> to operate, all have resulted in industry upheaval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There seems to be a 
consensus that technological innovation is now more critical than ever 
to maintain the competitiveness of the <b>oil</b> and gas industry. 
According to Deloitte, “The industry is at a critical juncture where 
companies must go beyond merely acknowledging the need to innovate and 
start executing upon this imperative in a systematic way or else their 
long-term survival may be in jeopardy.”&nbsp;1</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, according to the Canadian <b>Oil</b>
 Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA), when speaking to Canada’s standing 
committee on natural resources, “While some technologies are already in 
or nearing commercialization, many, especially the more transformative 
ones, could take more than a decade to become available for deployment. 
There is about a 10-year time horizon from ideation to commercial 
deployment in the <b>oil</b> and gas sector.”&nbsp;2</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How does the industry 
pursue innovation to drive real business value realization, find more 
innovative ways to cut costs, increase revenues, create more productive 
solutions in exploration and development, and make better decisions on 
operational risk — all while accelerating the pace to commercial 
deployment?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For starters, we work 
together. It sounds like a cliché but when key players, producers, 
research and technology innovators come together, the opportunity to 
vastly accelerate common industry agendas is realized. The healthcare 
industry is a perfect example of such transformative innovation through 
shared agendas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transformative technology like AI, advanced algorithms, machine-learning and cloud systems — powered by the <span class="companylink">IBM</span>
 Watson platform — made its first impact in healthcare in 2012 starting 
with oncology — the study and treatment of cancer and tumors. Why 
healthcare? Two reasons: First, human health impacts us all, and second,
 the amount of data in the global healthcare industry is massive and AI 
systems like <span class="companylink">IBM</span> Watson are built for 
big data challenges. Medical journals, clinical studies, medical text 
books, x-ray and scanning film, and personal healthcare records are full
 of important data, and the healthcare industry shares a common agenda —
 to deliver the best possible care to patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With this in mind, key healthcare organizations and <span class="companylink">IBM</span>
 came together to build an oncology treatment advisor. Watson ingested 
millions of pieces of structured, unstructured and complex data — from 
both public and private sources — and dramatically changed the face of 
patient care. From there, <span class="companylink">IBM</span> Watson 
and other industries joined forces to accelerate the pace of advancing 
common industry challenges within the banking and insurance, 
manufacturing, retail, education and yes, the <b>oil</b> and gas and mining industries, to drive real innovation across the value chain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Secondly, when industry 
players work together on shared agendas, they also align current 
research, expertise and emergent technology solutions to existing 
challenges to accelerate immediate term profitability goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notice we’re focusing on 
immediate term? We all know that when economic climates constrain, the 
focus rapidly turns to short-term performance as uncertainty drives up 
risk in longer-term innovation and capital project commitments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-investment in shared 
industry programs delivers benefits almost impossible to reap as 
individual organizations, such as reduced project and development 
resources, reduced costs associated with common deployment environments,
 lower cost recovery thresholds and the benefit of higher reusability of
 program components and artifacts that reduces the need for redundant or
 new work efforts for each project initiation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirdly, when industry 
players come together to form common agendas, they can more broadly 
capitalize on technological innovation and research such as the Internet
 of Things (IoT) and connected operations, predictive analytics, 
blockchain, cloud and AI. To be an innovator, you need to take risk, and
 with risk comes increased liability and the possibility of failure. 
According to the <span class="companylink">World Economic Forum</span>, “the global <b>oil</b> and gas industry has at least 10 years to go before reaching a similar level of digital maturity to aerospace or automotive.”3</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The natural resources 
industry has access to a tremendous amount of valuable data, technology 
and research capabilities. They are very good at collecting data, and 
the growth in data management service providers in the <b>oil</b> and 
gas industry supports this data collection; However, in the last five to
 ten years the growth in computing power and advanced technologies to 
capitalize and draw insight, understanding and predictions from 
historical data, and public data sources, has not been fully realized. 
The <b>oil</b> and gas industry still struggles with turning data into 
actionable insights that drive faster, safer and more intelligent work. 
The evolution of the industry from outdated legacy systems — not capable
 of handling the data and computer processing power available today — to
 more powerful operational focusses enabled digital systems will take 
time, effort, capital and most of all, a significant cultural change in 
the way the industry works and operates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imperative to the 
industry is the evolution to a modern operational architecture that can 
ingest the “4 V’s” of data — volume, variety, velocity and veracity — 
from internal and external sources, then integrate that insight into 
enterprise processes and workflows for meaningful outcomes. The 
advancement of AI platforms focused in specific industry verticals over 
the last five years, enables computing systems and AI to focus on 
simplifying the intensive processes and complexity in data collection 
and information retrieval, and even predictions, allowing the geologists
 and engineers to make better judgment calls and actions based on their 
experience and the new insights AI brings to their data sets.</p>

 Crawford remembers little of what happened the day he lost his health, 
his career, his home, his independence and, eventually, his marriage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One moment, he was a 
46-year-old hockey-playing oilfield worker connecting a hose to a valve 
at a rural Saskatchewan production facility in February 2014. The next, 
his face was sprayed with a mixture of <b>oil</b>, water and gas. He inhaled and swallowed it.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His
 medical records show that soup was laced with hydrogen sulphide (H2S), a
 toxic gas that carries risks to the human body ranging from burning 
vocal chords and olfactory senses to causing instant death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years later, 
Crawford's body struggles to complete its most basic tasks: chew food, 
swallow, taste, smell, speak properly, breathe clearly and sleep 
soundly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I eat everything through a mashed-up liquid diet,” he says. “I haven't smelled or tasted or eaten since the accident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a day that I relive every day,” he says. “With the medications, treatments, doctors, I relive that day every day.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No Saskatchewan 
government investigation followed and regulators took no actions in 
Crawford's case. The near-fatal accident appears nowhere in the 
province's incident database because the companies involved never 
reported it to authorities responsible for protecting public health and 
holding industry accountable, an investigation into <b>oil</b> industry safety by the Toronto Star, Global News and National Observer has found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ongoing investigation, which also includes students from journalism programs at Ryerson, Regina, Concordia the <span class="companylink">University of British Columbia</span>,
 has obtained documents through freedom of information laws that detail 
growing safety concerns about H2S, also known as sour gas, dating back 
to 2012. Those documents were never made public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province only learned of the incident that felled Crawford after receiving questions from reporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's disappointing we 
were not advised,” a provincial spokesperson wrote in a statement last 
week, declining an interview. “Valuable lessons may have been lost 
because of that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three months after 
Crawford's incident, Michael Bunz, a 38-year-old oilfield worker, died 
in a similar incident involving 
H2S[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/10/05/public-safety-is-the-number-one-priority-saskatchewan-government-says-after-toxic-gas-investigation.html].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province says it has 
now issued a notice of contravention against Crawford's former employer,
 a small trucking company in Unity, Sask., for failing to report. But no
 formal investigation or charges will follow because of a two-year 
statute of limitations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's too bad it happened
 but it wasn't known to be an H2S place,” said Daryl Heiland, owner of 
D.J. Heiland Trucking. “There's always a risk of it accumulating. That's

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province also says it is investigating the operators of the facility where the incident took place — owned by <span class="companylink">Cona Resources Ltd</span>. (formerly <span class="companylink">Northern Blizzard Resources Inc</span>.) — “to determine whether there was a breach of the regulations related to incident reporting.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cona officials declined 
repeated interview requests. In a statement, president and CEO Rob 
Morgan said the company never completed an investigation because it “did
 not receive nor was able to independently verify” information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Company officials, 
according to the statement, did assess equipment at the site that showed
 “between zero and a trace amount” of H2S. “The site is correctly marked
 to indicate the potential for sour gas even though the area is not 
generally known for sour gas production.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saskatchewan's Workers' 
Compensation Board and doctors who examined Crawford in Saskatchewan and
 Montreal have attributed his injuries directly to H2S. Medical 
diagnoses and opinions obtained by the Star reference H2S gas 16 times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with Crawford's 
physical ailments, psychological and neurological problems have emerged:
 PTSD, suicidal tendencies, anxiety and dizziness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crawford now lives with 
his parents in Montreal, unable to care for himself, living on workers' 
compensation benefits and spending his days in a sequence of medical 
appointments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I got divorced (from his
 common law partner) because of the eating and not sleeping properly. I 
sleep upright because if I fall asleep down I end up choking. I am here,
 but I'm here in a terrible way,” he says. “It was just too hard on her 
with the medical issues I was going through.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stunned and barely able 
to speak in the moments following the gassing on Feb. 9, 2014, Crawford,
 an industry veteran with nearly two decades of experience, stumbled to 
his truck and radioed for help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I tried to talk but my 
voice was messed up,” he says, his voice still raspy and broken. 
“Somebody came on and said, 'Are you OK? Are you OK?' I said, 'no, no.'”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then Crawford blacked out. He woke as he was being rushed to the small hospital in Unity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A note on his chart at 6:20 p.m. that evening reads: “Confirmed with boss at Northern Blizzard if any chemicals in <b>oil</b> — None.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After four intubation 
attempts, Crawford was put on life support and airlifted to Saskatoon. 
He regained consciousness two days later. Medical staff told him he had 
redlined three times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The doctors said it's a 
miracle for me to be here,” he says. “All everybody kept saying is they 
couldn't understand how I woke up from this.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crawford's initial 
diagnosis, detailed in his chart at Saskatoon Health Region, reads: 
“Post-inhalation injury of hydrogen sulphide,” which included symptoms 
of “loss of smell sense,” “difficulty swallowing and hoarseness.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Workers' Compensation
 Board accepted his injury claim a month later. A report from the WCB 
said Crawford was “struck in the face by a combination of crude <b>oil</b>,
 water and H2S gas,” which led to “difficulty breathing,” intubation, 
“inflammation of the throat area,” “lung collapse,” “swallowing and 
speech problems,” “olfactory paralysis” and “frequent severe headaches.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key factor in his diagnosis was H2S, a “toxic and irritating” substance that “affects basic metabolism.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The scarring documented 
of the palate/uvula area is almost certainly from the chemical burn he 
suffered from the H2S,” the report reads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The diagnosis came as no surprise to Crawford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I worked for quite a few <b>oil</b>
 companies and that was the only site I was ever nervous going into,” he
 says. “They said it was a sweet, not sour, field but every well we went
 into had HS2 marked on it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, industry and
 provincial Ministry of the Economy (ECON) officials were already 
dealing with complaints and concerns about H2S in southeast 
Saskatchewan, according to internal documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A 2012 
incident[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/10/01/that-rotten-stench-in-the-air-its-the-smell-of-deadly-gas-and-secrecy.html],
 in which a teenager was overcome by H2S in their driveway near Oxbow, 
Sask., triggered inspections of 11 <b>oil</b> and gas facilities. All 
failed with “serious infractions,” including releasing H2S at lethal 
levels “that may be exceeding 150,000 (parts per million),” according to
 an internal memo from December 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No fines or public 
warnings followed. No escalated enforcement, penalties or prosecutions 
followed. The problem continued. But Crawford and his other oilfield 
workers knew nothing about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are growing public
 concerns regarding the air quality issues in southeast Saskatchewan,” 
wrote an official with the industry's largest group, the <span class="companylink">Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP)</span>. “This has the potential to become a broader industry reputation/<b>social license</b> concern and warrants immediate attention by operators in the region.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a March 2013 letter, 
then-energy minister Tim McMillan — now president and CEO of CAPP — 
warned companies to meet “compliance obligations” or face “escalated 
enforcement, penalty and/or prosecution.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early 2014 — two 
months after Crawford's incident — government and industry officials met
 to discuss whether to make public ECON data showing H2S hot spots in 
the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“ECON believes current 
risk is significant,” read the minutes from the April 7, 2014 meeting. 
“Risk is highest for the workers, at the source … Are we creating a risk
 by not releasing this data immediately?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was never made public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May 2014, Michael Bunz died from H2S exposure from a broken valve on an <b>oil</b> tank near Carlyle, Sask. His employer is facing three charges under the province's occupational health and safety legislation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saskatchewan's 
regulations require that when workers are in situations that are 
“immediately dangerous” to life or health, employers and contractors 
“shall ensure that the worker is provided with and uses an approved 
atmosphere-supplying respirator” and that “a second worker, suitably 
equipped and trained, is present and in communication with the worker at
 all times.” The case remains before the courts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Bunz, Crawford was working alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There was nobody on 
site, which you're supposed to have,” he says. “After reading the story 
about Mr. Bunz, I just think this is so unnecessary … These <b>oil</b> 
companies keep doing the same thing and nothing changes. The government 
keeps letting them getting away with it. And I'm a forgotten person.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce Peachey, a petroleum engineering instructor at the <span class="companylink">University of Alberta</span>,
 says rules to warn workers about the potential presence of H2S and 
ensure two workers are present in dangerous situations are standard 
safety measures in the oilpatch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Aaron Thompson, 
program director for the occupational medicine at the University of 
Toronto, says that to lose consciousness, as Crawford did, signifies a 
“critical” incident that should have been reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That would seem to be a breakdown in reporting and a breakdown in the occupational health and safety system.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Provincial officials 
stated the province has increased inspections of wells and facilities 
that process high volumes of H2S, added inspectors and enforcement 
activities, erected air-monitoring stations and acquired highly 
sensitive hand-held measurement devices that allow inspectors to 
identify the source of sour gas odours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crawford says he filed complaints with <span class="companylink">Cona Resources</span> and the <span class="companylink">Mullen Group</span>,
 a transportation company that subcontracted to D.J. Heiland Trucking, 
but was never interviewed and never told of any investigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“All the safety guys came back and tried to blame the accident on me,” Crawford says of <span class="companylink">Mullen Group</span>, whose subsidiary, R.E. Line Trucking, is listed in some WCB documents as his employer. “I was in no shape to fight them.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Mullen Group</span> officials declined to be 
interviewed for this story. In a written statement, chairman and CEO 
Murray Mullen denied that company officials blamed Crawford. The 
statement confirms Crawford contacted the company's subsidiary, R.E. 
Line Trucking, two weeks after the incident and informed them he had 
“sustained a throat injury.” The statement says the subsidiary conducted
 an investigation along with Cona and D.J. Heiland Trucking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The statement does not detail that investigation, but says the area where the facility is located does not have H2S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This incident was not 
H2S related as you have alleged,” it reads. “We are not aware of any 
H2S-related incidents that would have required Saskatchewan 
(Occupational Health and Safety) reporting.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That conclusion contradicts Crawford's medical assessments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July 2014, a 
specialist in Montreal detailed Crawford's inability to swallow well, 
sleep apnea and speech problems “after his hydrogen sulphide exposure.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neurologist Michael Sidel concluded that Crawford suffered from “decreased taste and smell” as a result of exposure to H2S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sidel updated that 
assessment last year, stating Crawford suffers from “chronic dizziness, 
unsteadiness and decreased concentration. He has a permanent loss of 
smell and a functional change in his voice since the event. It is most 
probable that Mr. Crawford will not be able to return back to work on a 
permanent basis and his disability to some extent is likely permanent.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crawford's psychologist, 
Dr. Sydney Miller, wrote in 2015 that Crawford was suffering from 
serious PTSD following an injury involving the “inhalation and 
swallowing of hydrogen sulphide gas.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This past summer, 
Crawford says the Saskatchewan Workers Compensation Board threatened to 
stop his benefits and transition him back into the workforce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They were going to cut 
me off. After I said I spoke with (a Toronto Star journalist three weeks
 ago), now all of a sudden they're paying for everything again.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In principle, we are 
always working towards some form of return to work,” Phil Germain, 
vice-president of prevention at Saskatchewan WCB, said, not addressing 
Crawford's individual case. “That doesn't always happen. Sometimes it 
just can't happen. And that's fine. But we wouldn't be doing our job if 
we weren't trying.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sitting down for a meal, 
Crawford now goes through a ritual of liquefying his food and swallowing
 each mouthful slowly while pressing two fingers under his jaw to help 
it down with a slight gagging motion — among the many lingering effects 
of Feb. 9, 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I lost my house, I lost 
my truck, I lost everything I had. Thank God my parents are alive. If 
they weren't alive, I don't know where I'd be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was the healthiest guy
 in the world. I played hockey, I did sports, I hunted, I fished, I 
helped my dad with his renovation company, I worked, I had fun. Now, I 
don't do much.”</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 Canadian natural resources industry is undergoing enormous change. 
Volatile energy prices — the reality of US 55 per barrel — reduced 
production reliability, uncertain market access, the government’s 
climate change agenda, tightening environmental policy, safety, and 
compliance concerns along with increasing social drivers, such as <b>social license</b> to operate, all have resulted in industry upheaval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There seems to be a 
consensus that technological innovation is now more critical than ever 
to maintain the competitiveness of the <b>oil</b> and gas industry. 
According to Deloitte, “The industry is at a critical juncture where 
companies must go beyond merely acknowledging the need to innovate and 
start executing upon this imperative in a systematic way or else their 
long-term survival may be in jeopardy.”&nbsp;1</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, according to the Canadian <b>Oil</b>
 Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA), when speaking to Canada’s standing 
committee on natural resources, “While some technologies are already in 
or nearing commercialization, many, especially the more transformative 
ones, could take more than a decade to become available for deployment. 
There is about a 10-year time horizon from ideation to commercial 
deployment in the <b>oil</b> and gas sector.”&nbsp;2</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How does the industry 
pursue innovation to drive real business value realization, find more 
innovative ways to cut costs, increase revenues, create more productive 
solutions in exploration and development, and make better decisions on 
operational risk — all while accelerating the pace to commercial 
deployment?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For starters, we work 
together. It sounds like a cliché but when key players, producers, 
research and technology innovators come together, the opportunity to 
vastly accelerate common industry agendas is realized. The healthcare 
industry is a perfect example of such transformative innovation through 
shared agendas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transformative technology like AI, advanced algorithms, machine-learning and cloud systems — powered by the <span class="companylink">IBM</span>
 Watson platform — made its first impact in healthcare in 2012 starting 
with oncology — the study and treatment of cancer and tumors. Why 
healthcare? Two reasons: First, human health impacts us all, and second,
 the amount of data in the global healthcare industry is massive and AI 
systems like <span class="companylink">IBM</span> Watson are built for 
big data challenges. Medical journals, clinical studies, medical text 
books, x-ray and scanning film, and personal healthcare records are full
 of important data, and the healthcare industry shares a common agenda —
 to deliver the best possible care to patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With this in mind, key healthcare organizations and <span class="companylink">IBM</span>
 came together to build an oncology treatment advisor. Watson ingested 
millions of pieces of structured, unstructured and complex data — from 
both public and private sources — and dramatically changed the face of 
patient care. From there, <span class="companylink">IBM</span> Watson 
and other industries joined forces to accelerate the pace of advancing 
common industry challenges within the banking and insurance, 
manufacturing, retail, education and yes, the <b>oil</b> and gas and mining industries, to drive real innovation across the value chain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Secondly, when industry 
players work together on shared agendas, they also align current 
research, expertise and emergent technology solutions to existing 
challenges to accelerate immediate term profitability goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notice we’re focusing on 
immediate term? We all know that when economic climates constrain, the 
focus rapidly turns to short-term performance as uncertainty drives up 
risk in longer-term innovation and capital project commitments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-investment in shared 
industry programs delivers benefits almost impossible to reap as 
individual organizations, such as reduced project and development 
resources, reduced costs associated with common deployment environments,
 lower cost recovery thresholds and the benefit of higher reusability of
 program components and artifacts that reduces the need for redundant or
 new work efforts for each project initiation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirdly, when industry 
players come together to form common agendas, they can more broadly 
capitalize on technological innovation and research such as the Internet
 of Things (IoT) and connected operations, predictive analytics,

According to the <span class="companylink">World Economic Forum</span>, “the global <b>oil</b> and gas industry has at least 10 years to go before reaching a similar level of digital maturity to aerospace or automotive.”3</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The natural resources 
industry has access to a tremendous amount of valuable data, technology 
and research capabilities. They are very good at collecting data, and 
the growth in data management service providers in the <b>oil</b> and 
gas industry supports this data collection; However, in the last five to
 ten years the growth in computing power and advanced technologies to 
capitalize and draw insight, understanding and predictions from 
historical data, and public data sources, has not been fully realized. 
The <b>oil</b> and gas industry still struggles with turning data into 
actionable insights that drive faster, safer and more intelligent work. 
The evolution of the industry from outdated legacy systems — not capable
 of handling the data and computer processing power available today — to
 more powerful operational focusses enabled digital systems will take 
time, effort, capital and most of all, a significant cultural change in 
the way the industry works and operates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imperative to the 
industry is the evolution to a modern operational architecture that can 
ingest the “4 V’s” of data — volume, variety, velocity and veracity — 
from internal and external sources, then integrate that insight into 
enterprise processes and workflows for meaningful outcomes. The 
advancement of AI platforms focused in specific industry verticals over 
the last five years, enables computing systems and AI to focus on 
simplifying the intensive processes and complexity in data collection 
and information retrieval, and even predictions, allowing the geologists
 and engineers to make better judgment calls and actions based on their 
experience and the new insights AI brings to their data sets.</p>

 —On Dec. 6, The Northern Miner sat down for an exclusive interview with
 Tom Butler, CEO of the U.K.-based International Council of Mining and 
Metals (ICMM), to discuss climate change politics, as well as other 
prominentchallenges and themes on the international stage heading into 
2018.Butler became CEO of ICMM in July 2015. Before that, he spent 18 
years with the <span class="companylink">World Bank</span>'s <span class="companylink">International Finance Corporation</span> in the infrastructure and natural resource teams, with much of that time focused on mining and power projects in Africa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Northern Miner: What are some thoughts on how the mining industry is perceived globally today?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Butler: There's a trust gap, and the question is: How do we close it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mining industry isn't doing well in many countries. You see that in the loss of <b>social license</b>
 where governments feel they have political room to take actions because
 the industry doesn't have the support of local populations. So there's a
 lot of work to be done when it comes to communicating the positive 
impacts of mining and getting local populations behind that message. 
That's especially true in developing countries where the industry can be
 a real agent of change when it comes to alleviating poverty and 
bringing resources into an economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, we hear a lot about climate change and the expectation that industry should do its part. I think the <b>oil</b>
 and gas industry has been hit harder by that message because there's an
 awareness that mining is going to supply the raw materials needed to 
"decarbonize" the world. And it's not just minerals like lithium and 
cobalt, but also resources like iron ore and metallurgical coal. We 
believe some of Canada's major companies are really emerging as leaders 
in the climate change discussion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: What are some of the challenges mining companies face on the international stage heading into 2018?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TB: There are really 
three key issues you hear a lot about right now. First, society is 
expecting the private sector to add a lot more value to stakeholders, 
and not just shareholders. So that means we need to deliver on 
sustainable development goals, address climate change and deal with 
inequality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, there's a lot of 
attention paid to resource scarcity in the broader sense, and that goes 
beyond scarcity of minerals. It includes things like water, air and 
human resources. That’s leading to growing pressure around issues like 
water management at mine sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Third, there are now 
expectations for much greater accountability and transparency. So that 
means citizens are getting much more involved in terms of where they put
 their money. They want to know about their investments, and there's 
much greater demand for environmental, social and governance criteria to
 be published and disclosed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: It can be difficult 
to quantify the near-term financial benefits vis-à-vis investments on 
things like green energy and “decarbonizing.” How does that impact the 
dynamic between stakeholders, shareholders and capital markets?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TB: We believe there's 
more alignment between shareholders and stakeholders than many people 
recognize. The companies realize that the major investors — including 
pension funds — are watching what's happening with these issues. I 
mentioned that growing realization in capital markets that people are 
very interested in where their money is being invested. A growing number
 of funds are using governance, environmental and social criteria in 
judging investments. Certainly climate footprint is an element investors
 consider when making decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we're talking about <b>social license</b>
 to operate, and delivering on citizen expectations, these are things 
that can create a number of issues in the final analysis. If you're on 
the wrong side of the reputation debate you run the risk of having 
people not wanting to invest, which could impact the share price. 
Ultimately, there's no value for shareholders in shutting down, or 
losing, a valuable project due to a lack of local support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: There’s also a 
segment out there that’s anti-development insomuch as it represents 
opposition to mining and natural resources, generally. How do you deal 
with messaging like, for example, Apple saying it intends to make 
iPhones out of completely recycled material to "stop mining the planet”?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TB: You can sit down at the table with everyone. I think that movement is still very much on the fringe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact is if we're 
going decarbonize economies and deliver the material society needs, 
particularly as people move into the middle class in places like China, 
there's going to have to be a huge amount of commodities supplied by the
 mining industry. You're not going to get that out of purely recycled 
material.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that really 
highlights the importance of communication and leveraging platforms like
 social media to really get our message out there. We need to continue 
to underline the role mining will play in supplying the technology 
sector. It’s important for society to understand that mineral extraction
 is really part of the solution to many of these challenges.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Brian Schmidt, president and CEO of Tamarack Valley Energy Ltd. and a current board member of the <span class="companylink">Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP)</span>,
 said that in recent years the Canadian oilpatch has been delivered a 
series of “body blows” that have hindered the ability of companies to 
raise cash. Coupled with the impacts of the prolonged downturn, and it’s
 been tough sledding.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And
 Schmidt, who is chairman of CAPP’s Alberta Executive Policy Group, says
 current governments are doing little to help the situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think in other 
downturns we had help from governments that were interested in 
supporting our business. But we don’t have that right now. We’re pretty 
much on our own,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In fact, we’ve been 
dealt some significant body blows with pipeline issues, increased 
regulations, carbon tax, minimum wage—there are a lot of things that are
 working against the industry right now. And I think the [cancelation 
of] the Energy East pipeline was a very significant event that I don’t 
think we understand the total impact of. It was quite negative,” Schmidt
 added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So if you’re an investor
 and looking at several jurisdictions, Canada is not seen as a friendly 
jurisdiction to do business right now because of the complications we’ve
 had over the years. And that contrasts to other downturns where 
government and industry worked together to get some of these projects 
underway and did what it took to get it done. I’m not seeing that right 
now. I think the industry is on its own and you can expect more negative
 pressures here.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Leach, president of 
the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada (EPAC) agrees, saying 
the “unwelcoming business and investment climate that has developed in 
Canada in the last few years” has taken its toll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is a remarkable state of affairs for a country that relies heavily on the <b>oil</b>
 and gas industry to help balance its foreign trade, provide high paying
 jobs that supports equalization payments that flow from Alberta and 
Saskatchewan and contribute billions of dollars to federal and 
provincial coffers in royalties and taxes,” Leach said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It illustrates the 
inability of Canada’s political leadership at the federal and provincial
 levels to come together on what should be clear national interests: to 
make sure the nation’s non-renewable energy exports find markets at the 
highest world market price. It also illustrates the tremendously 
effective campaigns by industry opponents to influence politicians, 
policy and election outcomes in Canada.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Leach’s view, current 
government inaction and stance on some major energy projects runs 
counterintuitive to the nation’s best interests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I can’t think of another
 major energy producing nation, particularly among the world’s 
functioning democracies, with the potential Canada has to meet growing 
global demand, and yet has been so hobbled by its own governments in 
meeting that demand. Indeed, it’s no coincidence that a country like 
Canada with robust legal protection for the right to protest and with 
generous opportunities to intervene in the regulatory approval process, 
has attracted so much organized opposition,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s particularly disturbing when I think we can genuinely make the case there is no <b>oil</b>
 and gas industry in the world that has a better track record when it 
comes to responsible energy development. Even the head of the <span class="companylink">International Energy Agency</span> (Fatih Birol)in an October speech stated: ‘I wouldn't subscribe to the idea that we won't need <b>oil</b>
 anymore and a country like Canada, a reliable partner, a reliable 
producer, reliable exporter has a role to play in the global energy 
markets.’”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘Above ground issues’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Peter Tertzakian, executive director of ARC Energy Research Institute, 
said that while increased regulations are an issue, the challenges 
facing the <b>oil</b> and gas industry run much deeper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s broader than that. 
There’s the issue of Indigenous people and nimbyism—it’s just all 
wrapped up. It’s a very broad thing. I don’t want to be quoted as saying
 ‘it’s because of the government, or regulation or whatever.’ It’s far 
beyond that,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think it’s a large basket. I actually categorize it as ‘above ground issues.’&nbsp; The <b>oil</b>
 and gas industry has two dimensions. There’s the below ground issues of
 rock quality, the ability to get the stuff out of the ground, 
technology etcetera. So what’s happened is the below ground risks have 
diminished significantly over the last few years, but the above ground 
risks have been amplified,” Tertzakian added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And the above ground 
issues, all the way from local nimbyism to broad-based regulatory, to 
Indigenous issues and so on have increased. There’s no question that a 
lot of those above ground issues collectively are a drag on investment. 
It’s a very complex issue. I think we can agree that it’s the collective
 above ground dynamics that have hindered investment potential in 
Canada.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Duane Bratt, a political 
science professor at Calgary’s Mount Royal University, said the federal 
government’s decision to reorganize the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board (NEB) </span>has added to the challenges facing Canada’s <b>oil</b> and gas industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I do think the reorganization and the changes to the <span class="companylink">NEB</span>
 are significant. I don’t believe they’re the sole reason, or possibly 
even the major reason for the Energy East cancellation—I think the 
numbers that some economists have put forward talk about increased 
capacity and those sorts of things—but the fiddling with the <span class="companylink">NEB</span> is a problem,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Even if it wasn’t a 
problem with Energy East, it will be in other ones for a number of 
reasons. I think one of them is just the whole idea of looking at 
upstream and downstream effects. That becomes very complicated.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, Bratt is of 
the belief that the overall attractiveness of Canada’s oilpatch to 
would-be investors remains relatively intact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I would think our 
reputation remains quite good. It’s a politically stable country. Yeah, 
[governments] have brought in emissions standards and carbon taxes, but 
those carbon taxes are consumer-wide, economy-wide,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They’re not just focused
 solely on producers. I think it’s really about a cost issue. We’re a 
more costly economy to invest in, but a safer place to invest.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Combating the challenges: What can the industry do better?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bratt said that <b>oil</b> and gas industry efforts to obtain <b>social license</b> for large-scale projects and other industry-related initiatives have often fallen short.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And what’s interesting about that is you hear critics of <b>social license</b>
 say it’s a [Prime Minister Justin] Trudeau term or an [Alberta Premier 
Rachel] Notley term, but it’s not. It actually came out of the Canadian 
mining industry and has now been applied to larger types of projects, 
including those in the <b>oil</b> and gas industry,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you were to read Jim 
Prentice’s book [Triple Crown: Winning Canada’s Energy Future] or Dennis
 McConaghy’s book [Dysfunction: Canada After Keystone XL], they’re quite
 critical of the things that industry has done. And [industry] needs to 
share some of the blame for some of these [unsuccessful] projects, as 
well,” Bratt added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The MRU professor added that the <b>oil</b>
 and gas industry has done a relatively poor job in successfully 
informing the general populace of its successes and operational and 
environmental improvements, of which there are many.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The thing is, a lot of 
the work that industry has been doing on emission reductions in the 
oilsands, for example, I don’t think have been particularly well known 
and they have trouble getting that message out because for years, 
executives, and some of the industry groups, were denying there was ever
 even a problem,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Meanwhile, their 
scientists were working on ways of dropping emissions. So there’s 
actually I think some good news stories with some of the research and 
development that’s been done.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Canadian <b>oil</b>
 and gas sector has done better in recent years in its attempts to get 
its message across, Tamarack Valley’s Schmidt says there’s still work to
 be done in leveling the playing field against well-funded and organized
 opponents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think we have to 
realize that there’s a lot of money—and I would say out of country 
money—that’s coming in to campaign against the hydrocarbon industry 
here. And I think we’ve been far too complacent as an industry of just 
kind of letting that happen and then letting things go unanswered,” he 
said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So I think we need to be getting our message out there in different ways and more effectively and consistently.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leach believes that the 
industry has begun to successfully, for the most part, respond in recent
 years to the “shifting targets” of protesters who oppose energy 
infrastructure projects and the sector as a whole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We all remember the 
negative publicity around hydraulic fracturing and the industry and 
regulators effectively responded with science-based regulations and best
 practices to tackle concerns about chemical use, water consumption and 
induced seismicity. The target of opponents then shifted to pipelines 
where Canadian <b>oil</b> and gas producers are uniquely vulnerable due 
to government policy failures to ensure infrastructure was built when 
needed,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Ultimately I think the 
necessary pipelines and facilities to accommodate Canadian production of
 bitumen, liquids and natural gas in the next couple of decades will be 
built, but unfortunately years late. For example, both the B.C. and 
federal governments are signaling they are motivated to ensure that 
another LNG project does not fail.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leach added that the 
“evolving position” of the Alberta government on energy and pipelines is
 “proof attitudes can change, especially when you want to get 
re-elected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And as the disastrous 
effects of Ontario’s green energy policies on that province’s 
competitive position become more apparent to voters, we should expect a 
similar shift among a sufficient number of Canadian voters to influence 
national policies too,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not(ley) enough?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier Notley has 
embarked on a cross-Canada travelling road show to highlight the 
benefits of vital pipeline infrastructure, including in Vancouver and 
Central Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Schmidt, though appreciative, said that effort, that provincial government support, should have happened sooner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think [Notley] is 
doing the right thing in advocating for pipelines and how important they
 are to Canada. I don’t think Canadians, in general, understand how 
significant these projects are and how it impacts our ability to pay for
 health care and education and some of the things we enjoy right now,” 
he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think there’s a 
serious disconnect between the public and these pipelines. So I applaud 
Premier Notley for getting out and getting the word out, and she’s 
obviously going against some of her colleagues’ policies. So I think 
it’s good. But I think it’s too little, too late.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schmidt also said the attempt of the Notley government to attain <b>social license</b>
 for pipelines and other infrastructure by invoking a carbon tax and 
other environmental-directed measures may have not been the best laid of
 plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think the idea of getting so-called <b>social license</b> by giving into the Green movement and carbon taxes and that sort of thing really hasn’t worked,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think a far better 
strategy would be to compare how clean and how regulated our industry 
is. We’re the most regulated jurisdiction in the world. And that, I 
think, is something we should be very proud of as Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So not allowing our <b>oil</b>
 and gas to get to world markets just means the dirtier stuff and the 
stuff with conflict is going to get produced. I think that’s a better 
argument than carbon taxes or shutting down coal plants, that sort of 
thing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not the end of days</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the many issues and challenges facing the sector, Tertzakian said the Canadian <b>oil</b> and gas industry still has a viable future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think there’s a 
tendency for some to think that the whole industry is shut down. That’s 
far from the truth. The reality is that the industry is producing and 
exporting more <b>oil</b> and gas than ever. Consumers are consuming 
more than ever. Investment in certain segments of the business is 
showing signs of improvement,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So in some ways, given 
all these above ground issues, it’s remarkable that the industry 
continues to operate as well as it does. I would caution, though, it’s 
not just because of these above ground issues. There’s disruptive 
changes happening in the world of capital markets—migration to ETFs, for
 example.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tertzakian said that some
 companies are adapting to the “new realities” better than others and 
those that stumble in the needed transition likely won’t fare well going
 forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The industry is going to
 look different, recognizing that these above ground issues are unlikely
 to relent anytime soon,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The narrative I believe 
is that this industry is going to be part of what I call ‘the suppliers 
of the future.’ Those companies that understand above ground and below 
ground, those are going to be the suppliers of the future—those that

compliance concerns along with increasing social drivers, such as <b>social license</b> to operate, all have resulted in industry upheaval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There seems to be a 
consensus that technological innovation is now more critical than ever 
to maintain the competitiveness of the <b>oil</b> and gas industry. 
According to Deloitte, “The industry is at a critical juncture where

</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, according to the Canadian <b>Oil</b>

or nearing commercialization, many, especially the more transformative 
ones, could take more than a decade to become available for deployment. 
There is about a 10-year time horizon from ideation to commercial 
deployment in the <b>oil</b> and gas sector.”&nbsp;2</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How does the industry 
pursue innovation to drive real business value realization, find more 
innovative ways to cut costs, increase revenues, create more productive 
solutions in exploration and development, and make better decisions on 
operational risk — all while accelerating the pace to commercial 
deployment?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For starters, we work 
together. It sounds like a cliché but when key players, producers, 
research and technology innovators come together, the opportunity to 
vastly accelerate common industry agendas is realized. The healthcare 
industry is a perfect example of such transformative innovation through 
shared agendas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transformative technology like AI, advanced algorithms, machine-learning and cloud systems — powered by the <span class="companylink">IBM</span>
 Watson platform — made its first impact in healthcare in 2012 starting 
with oncology — the study and treatment of cancer and tumors. Why 
healthcare? Two reasons: First, human health impacts us all, and second,
 the amount of data in the global healthcare industry is massive and AI 
systems like <span class="companylink">IBM</span> Watson are built for 
big data challenges. Medical journals, clinical studies, medical text 
books, x-ray and scanning film, and personal healthcare records are full
 of important data, and the healthcare industry shares a common agenda —
 to deliver the best possible care to patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With this in mind, key healthcare organizations and <span class="companylink">IBM</span>
 came together to build an oncology treatment advisor. Watson ingested 
millions of pieces of structured, unstructured and complex data — from 
both public and private sources — and dramatically changed the face of 
patient care. From there, <span class="companylink">IBM</span> Watson 
and other industries joined forces to accelerate the pace of advancing 
common industry challenges within the banking and insurance, 
manufacturing, retail, education and yes, the <b>oil</b> and gas and mining industries, to drive real innovation across the value chain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Secondly, when industry 
players work together on shared agendas, they also align current 
research, expertise and emergent technology solutions to existing 
challenges to accelerate immediate term profitability goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notice we’re focusing on 
immediate term? We all know that when economic climates constrain, the 
focus rapidly turns to short-term performance as uncertainty drives up 
risk in longer-term innovation and capital project commitments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-investment in shared 
industry programs delivers benefits almost impossible to reap as 
individual organizations, such as reduced project and development 
resources, reduced costs associated with common deployment environments,
 lower cost recovery thresholds and the benefit of higher reusability of
 program components and artifacts that reduces the need for redundant or
 new work efforts for each project initiation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirdly, when industry 
players come together to form common agendas, they can more broadly 
capitalize on technological innovation and research such as the Internet
 of Things (IoT) and connected operations, predictive analytics, 
blockchain, cloud and AI. To be an innovator, you need to take risk, and
 with risk comes increased liability and the possibility of failure. 
According to the <span class="companylink">World Economic Forum</span>, “the global <b>oil</b> and gas industry has at least 10 years to go before reaching a similar level of digital maturity to aerospace or automotive.”3</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The natural resources 
industry has access to a tremendous amount of valuable data, technology 
and research capabilities. They are very good at collecting data, and 
the growth in data management service providers in the <b>oil</b> and 
gas industry supports this data collection; However, in the last five to
 ten years the growth in computing power and advanced technologies to 
capitalize and draw insight, understanding and predictions from 
historical data, and public data sources, has not been fully realized. 
The <b>oil</b> and gas industry still struggles with turning data into 
actionable insights that drive faster, safer and more intelligent work. 
The evolution of the industry from outdated legacy systems — not capable
 of handling the data and computer processing power available today — to
 more powerful operational focusses enabled digital systems will take 
time, effort, capital and most of all, a significant cultural change in 
the way the industry works and operates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imperative to the 
industry is the evolution to a modern operational architecture that can 
ingest the “4 V’s” of data — volume, variety, velocity and veracity — 
from internal and external sources, then integrate that insight into

advancement of AI platforms focused in specific industry verticals over

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Webber, author and mechanical engineering professor at the University of Texas at Austin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Source: <span class="companylink">University of Texas at Austin</span>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineering professor 
Michael Webber is deputy director of the University of Texas at Austin's
 Energy Institute, where one of specialties is researching the 
intersection of energy infrastructure engineering and policy. S&amp;P 
Global Market Intelligence talked with Webber about the challenges 
natural gas pipelines face in the current political, regulatory and 
market environment, as well as potential remedies for the industry. The 
following is an edited transcript of the conversation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S&amp;P Global Market 
Intelligence: There have been some recent decisions stalling or, in some
 instances, even overturning pipeline project approvals. Is this a sign 
that courts are becoming more sympathetic to pipeline opponents, or 
instead are pipeline opponents' arguments becoming more sophisticated?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Webber: I don't 
think courts have changed their outlooks, necessarily. I do think the 
opponents have become more sophisticated in two ways. One, I think their
 coalitions are a little more diverse, so it's not just the 
environmental groups. They often bring in land-rights groups, and so 
they get a little more of an ideological spread that way. The other 
thing is they focus more of their effort on midstream rather than 
production sites. For a long time, opponents to <b>oil</b> and gas would
 focus on production to stop the extraction. Then they found over time 
that stopping the midstream is easier and it has the same effect because
 if you can't move gas to market, then you wouldn't produce in the first
 place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second piece to this 
is as time goes on, accidents happen. Every single accident of a 
pipeline, every spill or leak or problem, becomes part of the collection
 of evidence against pipelines. Time is on the side of the opponents. 
The more time goes on, the more accidents will happen, and that's used 
as part of the case to stop the construction of new pipes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think all projects are 
seeing the same kind of thing, which is more legal action at the 
midstream level, and more groups are brought to the table for that legal
 action. Every leak that happens just damns the case. The more leaks 
that happen, especially if it's the same company or pipeline or region, 
makes it that much harder to get approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is there anything developers can do to counter this momentum that opponents seem to have?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not sure what the 
best strategy is, but I think there are advantages if pipeline 
developers explain the relative safety of pipes versus trains. An 
alternative to moving by pipe is to move <b>oil</b> by train, for 
example, and trains have their own safety record that's problematic. 
They could talk about the comparative safety and cleanliness of the pipe
 versus the train.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other thing they 
could talk about is the comparative safety of piped gas than coal, for 
example, because there's less pollution from gas and [fewer] people will
 die from respiratory infection. They've got the argument that pipelines
 actually offer an environmental advantage, compared to rail or coal. I 
think you'll start to see that kind of thing happen more and more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What do midstream companies need to focus on in order to maintain their <b>social license</b>? Is that at risk in a post-Dakota Access and post-Keystone XL U.S.? If it is, how big of a risk factor are we talking about?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think it is a risk. The
 midstream sector needs to do a better job developing stakeholder groups
 they can communicate well with and explain the broader argument of why 
it's beneficial to have pipelines. It's ultimately something pipeline 
companies have done a bad job on, that sort of social engagement, and 
that's how they get opposition. It could be life or death for a certain 
pipeline, not necessarily to the companies, but if they can't get a <b>social license</b>, they can't get a permit, they can't build or operate the pipeline. Absolutely, it's a high-stakes situation for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking out to 2018, 
what's the one area you think pipeline companies should focus on to 
ensure that a project will be successful?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pipelines tend to be at 
their best when they are first built. Brand-new materials degrade over 
time because the soils shift or because of corrosion of the pipelines. 
The problem with pipelines is not year one, but maybe year 20, year 40 
in its lifetime. One way to deal with that is to build in a fund that 
accumulates money so when the money is needed to improve or replace a 
pipeline, the money is available. It's easier to do that early on before
 you need it than to wait until you need it to do it. I feel like that 
should be part of what's going on with pipelines is built-in funding for
 when inevitably a problem occurs, to avoid that problem and then to 
mitigate that problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is there anything else you want to mention that we have not covered?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The infrastructure of midstream, in general, is an important part of energy, not just for <b>oil</b> and gas and pipelines. Moving energy around is a difficult task and is required for all forms of energy.</p>

 an NDP Alberta premier is touring the country - or at least a few 
select cities - touting the benefits of pipelines that take Albertan <b>oil</b> to market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Justin 
Trudeau has borrowed Rachel Notley's logic, framing his environmental 
policies as a way to smooth over pipeline approvals and win "<b>social license</b>" for the emissions-intense bitumen shipped from the <b>oil</b> sands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Canadians start to 
feel the pinch from newly-introduced carbon taxes, the pipelines - and 
the jobs they bring - take on an increased importance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's where the major pipeline projects stand as we push into the second half of both Notley and Trudeau's first term in power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keystone XL</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you didn't see any 
touchdown celebrations after Nebraska approved the $8 billion Keystone 
XL pipeline this week, that's because it came with some major caveats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may also be because 
everyone involved in the Keystone pipeline is pretty jaded after former 
U.S. President Barack Obama delayed the project in 2011, before finally 
killing it in 2015. It was revitalized this year by Donald Trump, but 
there's still major hurdles to clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The approval from 
Nebraska requires a new route, which will cause all kinds of 
construction and legal complications in that state and possibly a whole 
new review(

Trudeau speaks with pipeline protestors as they stand and hold signs at a

26, 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trans Mountain</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trans Mountain 
pipeline is one of the few bright lights on the pipeline front. Not only
 has it cleared regulatory hurdles, but it also takes Alberta <b>oil</b> to the west coast, which will get a better price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> has already started site preparations and terminal construction and expects to begin pipeline construction in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's not to say its

Pipeline protests in the United States and wonder if something similar 
could happen in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Edmonton Journal 
columnist Graham Thomson wrote on Thursday, "Notley needs construction 
of the project to begin in 2018 to have a fighting chance in the 2019 
provincial election."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau's problem isn't 
existential like Notley's, but not getting Trans Mountain built, after 
vetoing the Northern Gateway pipeline and seeing <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> kill Energy East will still come with a political price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Line 3 Replacement</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid the frenzied

 ) in Alberta for the Trans Mountain approval, Enbridge's Line 3 
expansion pipeline got a little shortchanged on fanfare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Trans Mountain 
is more likely to get name-checked, the Alberta NDP constantly 
references the "two pipeline approvals" won on their watch, with the 
second one being Line 3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pipeline was approved
 last year - at the same time as Trans Mountain - and is a $8.2 billion 
project, with $5.3 billion worth of it happening in Canada. The pipeline
 runs from Hardisty, AB to Wisconsin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan is to replace 
the existing Line 3 with a new pipeline, improving safety and boosting 
capacity, which perhaps explains why it flew under the radar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite that, Enbridge is
 still bickering with Minnesota about final approval of the deal. A 
ruling in December( 
http://www.ctvnews.ca/business/enbridge-says-line-3-project-progressing-despite-rising-scrutiny-in-minnesota-1.3660206[http://www.ctvnews.ca/business/enbridge-says-line-3-project-progressing-despite-rising-scrutiny-in-minnesota-1.3660206]
 ) from that state will decide if the project goes ahead as planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy East and Northern Gateway</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These two pipelines are dead, although recriminations over why are still flying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northern Gateway ran into
 trouble, in part, because the courts believed the government hadn't 
adequately consulted with First Nations about the project. Alongside the
 decision to approve Line 3 and Trans Mountain, Trudeau also pulled the 
plug on Northern Gateway, saying it didn't serve the best interests of 
the affected communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy East was killed by <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>
 itself, and some blamed the burdensome regulatory environment for the 
company's decision. Others blamed the economics of the pipeline( 
http://business.financialpost.com/opinion/terence-corcoran-economic-reality-killed-the-energy-east-pipe-dream-and-thats-good[http://business.financialpost.com/opinion/terence-corcoran-economic-reality-killed-the-energy-east-pipe-dream-and-thats-good]
 ), which required <b>oil</b> to be at a price that may not be realistic anymore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a common thread running through all the new pipeline projects in Canada. With <b>oil</b> prices stagnating, competing shale <b>oil</b>
 showing no signs of slowing down and carbon pricing soon to be a 
reality across the country, the cost benefit analysis of every pipeline 
is changing for the worse.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 Canadian natural resources industry is undergoing enormous change. 
Volatile energy prices — the reality of US 55 per barrel — reduced 
production reliability, uncertain market access, the government’s 
climate change agenda, tightening environmental policy, safety, and 
compliance concerns along with increasing social drivers, such as <b>social license</b> to operate, all have resulted in industry upheaval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There seems to be a 
consensus that technological innovation is now more critical than ever 
to maintain the competitiveness of the <b>oil</b> and gas industry. 
According to Deloitte, “The industry is at a critical juncture where 
companies must go beyond merely acknowledging the need to innovate and 
start executing upon this imperative in a systematic way or else their 
long-term survival may be in jeopardy.”&nbsp;1</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, according to the Canadian <b>Oil</b>
 Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA), when speaking to Canada’s standing 
committee on natural resources, “While some technologies are already in 
or nearing commercialization, many, especially the more transformative 
ones, could take more than a decade to become available for deployment. 
There is about a 10-year time horizon from ideation to commercial 
deployment in the <b>oil</b> and gas sector.”&nbsp;2</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How does the industry 
pursue innovation to drive real business value realization, find more 
innovative ways to cut costs, increase revenues, create more productive 
solutions in exploration and development, and make better decisions on 
operational risk — all while accelerating the pace to commercial 
deployment?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For starters, we work 
together. It sounds like a cliché but when key players, producers, 
research and technology innovators come together, the opportunity to 
vastly accelerate common industry agendas is realized. The healthcare 
industry is a perfect example of such transformative innovation through 
shared agendas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transformative technology like AI, advanced algorithms, machine-learning and cloud systems — powered by the <span class="companylink">IBM</span>
 Watson platform — made its first impact in healthcare in 2012 starting 
with oncology — the study and treatment of cancer and tumors. Why 
healthcare? Two reasons: First, human health impacts us all, and second,
 the amount of data in the global healthcare industry is massive and AI 
systems like <span class="companylink">IBM</span> Watson are built for 
big data challenges. Medical journals, clinical studies, medical text 
books, x-ray and scanning film, and personal healthcare records are full
 of important data, and the healthcare industry shares a common agenda —
 to deliver the best possible care to patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With this in mind, key healthcare organizations and <span class="companylink">IBM</span>
 came together to build an oncology treatment advisor. Watson ingested 
millions of pieces of structured, unstructured and complex data — from 
both public and private sources — and dramatically changed the face of 
patient care. From there, <span class="companylink">IBM</span> Watson 
and other industries joined forces to accelerate the pace of advancing 
common industry challenges within the banking and insurance, 
manufacturing, retail, education and yes, the <b>oil</b> and gas and mining industries, to drive real innovation across the value chain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Secondly, when industry 
players work together on shared agendas, they also align current 
research, expertise and emergent technology solutions to existing 
challenges to accelerate immediate term profitability goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notice we’re focusing on 
immediate term? We all know that when economic climates constrain, the 
focus rapidly turns to short-term performance as uncertainty drives up 
risk in longer-term innovation and capital project commitments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-investment in shared 
industry programs delivers benefits almost impossible to reap as 
individual organizations, such as reduced project and development 
resources, reduced costs associated with common deployment environments,
 lower cost recovery thresholds and the benefit of higher reusability of
 program components and artifacts that reduces the need for redundant or
 new work efforts for each project initiation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirdly, when industry 
players come together to form common agendas, they can more broadly 
capitalize on technological innovation and research such as the Internet
 of Things (IoT) and connected operations, predictive analytics, 
blockchain, cloud and AI. To be an innovator, you need to take risk, and
 with risk comes increased liability and the possibility of failure. 
According to the <span class="companylink">World Economic Forum</span>, “the global <b>oil</b> and gas industry has at least 10 years to go before reaching a similar level of digital maturity to aerospace or automotive.”3</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The natural resources 
industry has access to a tremendous amount of valuable data, technology 
and research capabilities. They are very good at collecting data, and 
the growth in data management service providers in the <b>oil</b> and 
gas industry supports this data collection; However, in the last five to
 ten years the growth in computing power and advanced technologies to 
capitalize and draw insight, understanding and predictions from 
historical data, and public data sources, has not been fully realized. 
The <b>oil</b> and gas industry still struggles with turning data into 
actionable insights that drive faster, safer and more intelligent work. 
The evolution of the industry from outdated legacy systems — not capable
 of handling the data and computer processing power available today — to
 more powerful operational focusses enabled digital systems will take 
time, effort, capital and most of all, a significant cultural change in 
the way the industry works and operates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imperative to the 
industry is the evolution to a modern operational architecture that can 
ingest the “4 V’s” of data — volume, variety, velocity and veracity — 
from internal and external sources, then integrate that insight into 
enterprise processes and workflows for meaningful outcomes. The 
advancement of AI platforms focused in specific industry verticals over 
the last five years, enables computing systems and AI to focus on 
simplifying the intensive processes and complexity in data collection 
and information retrieval, and even predictions, allowing the geologists
 and engineers to make better judgment calls and actions based on their 
experience and the new insights AI brings to their data sets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strategic enablement of digital technologies in the <b>oil</b> and gas industry is now fundamental to its survival. At <span class="companylink">IBM</span>, we believe there is a place for shared agendas to advance innovation through digital transformation. We’ve just launched the <span class="companylink">IBM</span> Watson for Natural Resources Innovation program in the Canadian <b>oil</b>

Donald Trump may have saved Rachel Notley's political hide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Admittedly, an NDP win remains a real long shot in the 2019 election.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But
 for the NDP to have any shot, at least one major pipeline has to be 
under construction by the time the election is called in the spring of 
2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot else has to be going right, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price of <b>oil</b> 
has to continue its climb from where it is now (in the $55US range) to 
around $70US. The NDP have to reduce spending and begin to get their 
deficit under control. And tens of thousands of energy-sector workers 
have to be back working again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, if the Alberta 
economy is humming when the election is called two years from now, there
 is an extremely narrow path to victory for the New Democrats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Keystone XL (KXL) 
is the pipeline most likely to be under construction by 2019, Notley and
 the NPD owe their tiny sliver of hope to the U.S. president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, it was Trump 
who agreed to give federal permits to the $8-billion pipeline project 
back in March. That reversed seven years of stalling and, finally, 
outright rejection by the Obama administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, technically, it was Monday's approval by the <span class="companylink">Nebraska Public Service Commission</span>
 that removed the last official hurdle to Keystone XL. But without 
Trump's approval first, the Nebraskans wouldn't even have made a 
decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot can still go wrong. <span class="companylink">TransCanada Corp</span>.
 might decide not to go ahead with the 1,800-km extension of their 
existing Keystone line that would connect Alberta's oilsands with a 
pipeline hub in Cushing, Oklahoma.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>
 cancelled the Energy East pipeline in October, it did so mostly because
 of environmental hurdles erected by Justin Trudeau's federal Liberal 
government. But to the extent that decision was economic, Keystone might
 prove to be equally uneconomic..</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American courts might 
also side with environmentalists or Nebraska ranchers and issue 
injunctions against construction. Or protestors might block construction
 for weeks or months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, Keystone is far from a done deal just yet, although it remains the most likely major pipeline to actually get built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be a shame 
though if Keystone helped Notley get re-elected. At the very best, her 
attitude towards the project has been lukewarm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our premier has held many
 positions on Keystone, but she has probably been opposed or indifferent
 more than she has been in favour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Notley and the NDP were in opposition before the May 2015 election, they were clearly against the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then during the campaign 
they sent mixed messages. Candidate Rachel Notley told the Edmonton 
Sun's editorial board she was in favour of Keystone. Later she told the 
CBC's Evan Solomon "we're against it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly after being sworn
 in as premier in May 2015, her federal NDP brethren came out staunchly 
against Keystone during the federal election. Notley refused to 
repudiate their stance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Barack Obama 
announced he was blocking Keystone in November 2015 - the same month the
 New Dems came out with their carbon tax and climate leadership plan - 
Notley refused to go to Washington to complain. She made it clear she'd 
rather Keystone didn't go ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the last U.S. 
presidential race, when Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton declared 
herself against Keystone, Notley said she and Clinton were on the same 
page.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Trump was elected in November 2016, Notley refused once again to go to D.C. to lobby for Keystone saying it "was not key."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, I suppose, because her "<b>social license</b>"
 strategy has failed so miserably to get a single Canadian pipeline 
built, maybe that's why Notley has suddenly become such a big booster of
 Keystone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Donald Trump has become Rachel Notley's last, best chance of a second term.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later
 this month, Premier Rachel Notley will set off on a cross-Canada 
speaking tour to try to drum up support for pipelines, specifically for 
the already-approved Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is an effort all Albertans can support, no matter what one thinks of her and her government.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We all need her rhetorical diplomacy to succeed. Our province's future prosperity needs <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> to be built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trans Mountain expansion is, essentially, the twinning of a pipeline that has operated safely since the 1950s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It should be a slam dunk.
 It will take up almost no new land, cross no lakes or rivers it does 
not already cross. Its increased infringement on First Nations land will
 be negligible after construction is complete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that hasn't stopped 
environmentalists from going hysterical, particularly since the federal 
government approved the line almost exactly a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environmental activists 
have threatened to fight the expansion in the courts and "in the woods,"
 by which they mean demonstrations, sit-ins and, perhaps, even domestic 
terrorism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Karen Mahon - 
who until June was one of Notley's closest advisors on oilsands 
development (Mahon wanted none) - and around 60 other "green" activists 
kayaked out into Vancouver's Burrard Inlet and chained their boats to a <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> construction barge. Five, including Mahon, were arrested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason Notley has
 to be convincing on her cross-country speaking tour: For too long she 
has been far, far too cozy with eco-crazies who firmly believe all 
pipelines are the work of corporate devils, that they all must be 
stopped and that in their place Canada's economy can be powered by 
unicorn farts and fairy wands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During her tour at the 
end of the month, Notley has to convince investors and voters, both, 
that her days of trying to get pipelines approved by currying favour 
with eco-activists through carbon taxes and emission caps are done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What she calls "<b>social license</b>" has scared away investors and deepened and lengthened Alberta's recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This upcoming tour has to
 be her last gloves-on attempt to get a pipeline through to the coast. 
If this doesn't work, the gloves have to come off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the "kayaktivists" arrested along with former Notley advisor Mahon - Liam Fox, a <span class="companylink">Simon Fraser University</span> grad student - promised their stunt was only the beginning. "We don't have any other option. This pipeline has to be stopped."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mahon herself pledged "you are going to see a rise of resistance like (B.C.) hasn't seen before."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, of course, B.C.'s new NDP government is also pledged to stopping the line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If activists are going to do "whatever it takes" to stop <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>,
 Notley has to lead those who will do whatever it takes to get it built.
 There is no other natural leader for the propipeline effort. And the 
premier's national tour is the perfect place for her to prove she 
possesses that determination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because if she won't do whatever it takes, you can bet new UCP Leader Jason Kenney will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Alberta desperately needs pipelines (plural) built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study of the NDP's deficit spending and accumulating debt, released last week by the <span class="companylink">University of Calgary</span>'s school of public policy, shows how utterly unsustainable their spending spree is without more and more <b>oil</b> revenues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, while the 
NDP insists the province's debt will increase by $27.2 billion over the 
next three years, the U. of C. study says the reality could easily be 
closer to $38.9 billion - over 40 per cent above the Notley government's
 estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That should give the premier incentive to do some impassioned talking on her tour.</p>

 - In an ornate ballroom in one of downtown Calgary's few Edwardian 
hotels, hundreds of dark-suited men and women gathered over lunch 
Tuesday to hash out one of the questions festering at the heart of 
Alberta's politics: What really happened to Energy East?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> pipeline was intended to be a win-win project: Alberta would gain access to tidewater for its beleaguered bitumen; <b>oil</b>
 would travel to a refinery on Canada's east coast; resources would stay
 in the country. But in October the company killed it, inspiring 
interprovincial rancour and darkening the province's increasingly sour 
mood.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter to the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>
 explaining its decision, the company cited "delays resulting from the 
regulatory process," among other obstacles. Andrew Leach, a professor of
 energy policy at the University of Alberta and one of the architects of
 Alberta's climate change policy, was among the loudest voices crying 
foul over <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s implication. Canning Energy East was a reasonable business decision inspired by low <b>oil</b>
 prices, reduced oilsands production forecasts and the imminent approval
 of Keystone XL, Leach had argued publicly in the wake of the 
announcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, Leach gathered with Dennis McConaghy, <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s
 former executive vice-president of corporate development, and Martha 
Hall Findlay, president of the Canada West Foundation and once a Liberal
 MP for a Toronto riding, to hash the matter out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leach contended that Energy East's fate was clear once Trump was elected. <b>Oil</b>
 prices are low, production predictions have been slashed, and once 
Keystone XL was back on the table, the less-efficient Energy East was 
doomed. "It was the most expensive of the pipeline projects, so the one 
you naturally take off the deck," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Energy East panel, left to right: Andrew Leach, Dennis McConaghy and Martha Hall Findlay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McConaghy took issue with
 that position. Energy East already had shipping contracts lined up, he 
said, and while Alberta might indeed maintain adequate pipeline supply 
if both Keystone XL and the TransMountain pipeline are approved, the 
fate of those two projects is still uncertain. (Keystone XL is still 
awaiting sign-off from Nebraska's state government, while TransMountain 
must face an interprovincial intransigence so entrenched that Alberta 
premier Rachel Notley plans to go on a cross-country road trip to 
support the project.) Energy East would have been a viable third option,
 and <b>oil</b> companies were willing to pay the price of potentially having too much capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The real tragedy of losing Energy East was that a set of circumstances evolved to reach a point where <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>
 couldn't just suspend the project, but went on to terminate it, and 
that was fundamentally driven by a conviction they could never get the 
permit," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The regulatory process 
has simply become so unpredictable that no sane company will throw 
billions of dollars behind a project that can be cancelled on a 
political whim, just as Northern Gateway was, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is total 
uncertainty in this country about whether we can get anything built," 
Hall Findlay said, adding that among resource companies Canada was 
beginning to acquire the reputation for political uncertainty of a 
banana republic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no political 
clarity around what this country wants or what it will approve, she 
added. The approvals process is now taking decades, in hopes of creating
 a <b>social license</b> that will never be granted by staunch 
anti-oilsands activists. The cost of that delay for business can reach 
hundreds of millions of dollars per month.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McConaghy said that if 
the government wants to impose an even-handed carbon strategy, well, 
fine. Just make that clear upfront and apply it to all industries 
equally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not like these 
points haven't been made to the Trudeau government," he said. The 
government heard all these gripes and then "dismissed all the actual 
problems and instead advocated for more open-ended engagement, as if the
 regulatory process were a focus group as opposed to a technocratic 
exercise."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the eyes of both Hall 
Findlay and McConaghy, nothing exemplified this more than Energy East. 
After the regulatory process had begun, the <span class="companylink">NEB</span> said that it would take into consideration greenhouse gas emissions from the oilsands and the <b>oil</b>
 burned after it left the line rather than just the emissions of the 
actual pipeline. This was untenable, they argued, the sort of standard 
that would never be applied to central Canadian industries. It would be 
like judging the approval of an auto plant based on the lifetime 
emissions of all the cars it produced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The final straw was moving the goalposts," Hall Findlay said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Establish what the 
strategy is and then let our regulatory bodies implement those 
directions. But let them do their jobs. If every decision then comes 
back to what is a political win, we will not get anything done."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> executives announce the company's Energy East Pipeline project on Aug. 1, 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there was no doubt in
 Hall Findlay's mind that the cancellation of Energy East was celebrated
 in the Prime Minister's office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When that announcement 
was made, there were champagne bottles popping in Ottawa," she said. As 
the Liberals face more competition from the NDP, the pipeline "would 
have been a major, major headache for the federal Liberals."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite this, both Hall 
Findlay and Leach warned about the increasingly vicious rhetoric 
currently being bandied about across provincial lines: UCP leader Jason 
Kenney has said he would scrap Alberta's carbon tax and cut permits to <b>oil</b>
 pipelines feeding B.C. if it continues to stall the TransMountain 
expansion. Those threats only add to the culture of political 
uncertainty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But McConaghy nonetheless echoed the darker sentiment now rippling through much of the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think it's naive to 
think that in a scenario where Keystone XL doesn't happen because of 
Nebraska and TransMountain (falters) because the federal government 
didn't enforce (its regulatory approval, the idea that Alberta is going 
to be saying 'We stepped up. We applied the most stringent carbon tax in
 the country and you stiffed us on market access,'" he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"No one should think the political reaction to that isn't going to be extreme."</p>

Greater Vancouver Board of Trade Nov. 30, her audience will likely be 
sympathetic, but it will give her a platform to reach other British 
Columbians who can be swayed, as she attracts local media attention, 
said George Hoberg, a professor at the University of British Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I suspect her goal is to
 reach the political middle in B.C., to make the best case to those who 
are not in the camp of active, adamant opponents," Hoberg said in email 
exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That audience is 
critical to how responsive the (B.C.) NDP government is likely to be to 
pipeline opponents. It will also be very important in the dynamics of 
protest and police response that will occur, should construction ramp 
up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hoberg, who teaches 
environmental and natural resource policy, also warned that "First 
Nation and environmental opponents to the pipeline will do their best to
 greet Notley and make sure their message continues to get attention as 
well."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley said her 
government - which has attempted to secure support for pipelines by 
imposing a climate change agenda that includes a carbon tax and cap on 
oilsands emissions - has "reasonable levels of credibility" among 
Canadians who are concerned about the environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are people who still can have their mind changed, and it's important to get the facts out there," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prasad Panda, energy 
critic for the United Conservative Party, supports Notley's move but 
argues she should have invited him and other opposition MLAs to join her
 in a united front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Panda said he believes Notley genuinely backs the <b>oil</b>
 and gas industry, but he questioned her decision making, having 
appointed environmentalists Tzeporah Berman and Karen Mahon to an 
oilsands advisory panel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were among several 
panelists who were excused in June, not because of their beliefs, but 
because the group's focus had shifted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both activists have 
openly opposed the Trans Mountain pipeline. Mahon was recently arrested 
after she and three other protestors took to kayaks and roped themselves
 to a barge near <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s marine terminal in Burnaby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For the last two years, 
(Notley) was living in a fool's paradise thinking that by imposing a 
carbon tax and by imposing the cap on oilsands development, she would 
get <b>social license</b>, but that is not the case," Panda said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kinder Morgan chief 
executive Steve Kean recently warned that delays in securing permits and
 regulatory approvals could put the project nine months behind schedule,
 though the company is exploring measures to speed things up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has also 
warned that every month of delay from its planned December 2019 
in-service date would directly cost as much as $35 million, and another 
$90 million a month in lost revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The B.C. government has vowed to use any means at its disposal to stop the project, which would twin <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s
 existing line, more than tripling its capacity and getting more Alberta
 crude to tidewater for export. It also faces legal challenges by 
environmentalists, Indigenous communities and B.C. municipalities.</p>

 ancient days, the Brits had a television show called That Was The Week 
That Was. It was a confected catalogue of absurdities, mischiefs and 
embarrassments delivered with all that sarcasm and parody could provide.
 It was impossible not to think of that show this week, as the Liberal A
 Team of the prime minister and his (now) battered finance minister 
explored with the utmost diligence how to make themselves, at various 
times, appear flatfooted, obnoxious, condescending, evasive, and 
infinitely out of touch with how people of normal means and ordinary 
lives think and feel.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As
 the tumult of horrors unfolded I thought yet again of the early days of
 this "transparent" administration, and their summons of the 
Deliverology mage from out of the dark labyrinths of British politics. 
In a just world, Trudeau would be demanding a rebate from that tony 
consultant. For on what single major issue have they delivered? The 
question is worth reiterating: Is there a single significant policy that
 Trudeau made central to his party and government that has not been a 
tangle of confusion, inept communication, reversal, or abandonment? 
Electoral reform: a messy bust. First-past-thepost. Gone with the wind 
that produced the promise. The inquiry into missing and murdered 
Indigenous women: over the months that it has stumbled along, the 
inquiry has shed its members, been dismissed by those it was meant to 
serve, and has had the bitterly ironic result of making relations 
between aboriginals and government worse than before it started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The great promise of 
social licence? A quick trip to Alberta and a five-minute conversation 
with anyone working (or, more commonly, who used to work) in the <b>oil</b> industry will tell you how empty that promise has proved to be. <b>Social license</b>
 turns out to be one of those tag phrases the prime minister is so fond 
of, that he throws around as if they were magicians' wands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then we come to this 
week, and the "tax fairness" reforms. This week was meant to unravel all
 the trouble that has been brought down upon by this government by the 
original tax reform package that Morneau introduced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting with a press 
conference in Stouffville - as all have noted, well out of the House of 
Commons and question period - the prime minister took the reins. With 
astonishing condescension, the country's premier male feminist 
intercepted a question from a female journalist that was directed at 
Morneau. He told her she now had the chance to "direct it to the prime 
minister." From sunny days to the Sun King of 24 Sussex Drive. 
Simultaneously, he flicked Morneau to the back of the room - a flare of 
arrogant imperiousness that hardly consorts with the image of Trudeau as
 the sensitive, warm, overflowing basket of charm that his handlers have
 crafted for him with such industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Poor Morneau was, for the
 next few days, sent into exile from question period, while the prime 
minister and a few of his hapless front benchers tried to rescue the 
total botch of tax reform, and, of far more consequence, attempted to 
provide some sort of defence for the embroiled Minister of Finance. 
Question period became a factory of non sequiturs, illogicalities, and 
some of the most ham-handed, amateurhour evasions and denials to ever 
disgrace the pages of Hansard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think it is dawning on 
some that our celebrity prime minister is great at first nights, foreign
 conferences, concerts, We Days, Women in Power summits, and American 
morning TV shows. As a master of ceremonies or the guest celebrity of 
the day, he's a winner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in question period, he is on alien ground. In question period, he should own an honorary spot on the opposition benches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there was a low point 
this week - and it is difficult to select one out of its spate of 
mumbles and jumbles - it would have to be when the prime minister made 
the beautiful malapropism of twice referring to Mary Dawson as the 
"Conflict of Ethics Commissioner."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is more than a hint 
that the prime minister doesn't really understand the Office of the 
Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner. Commissioner Mary Dawson 
is NOT the first or last authority on the ethics of the House or its 
members. They are. The House is. And the prime minister as government 
leader is, or should be, the first guardian and watchdog over the 
behaviour of his ministers and members. Mary Dawson is just a source of 
prudent backup. The attempts of the prime minister and finance minister 
to outsource their ethical standards to a parliamentary office, to 
position Dawson as somehow responsible for the deep pit they have so 
zealously excavated for themselves, is an outrage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week is, I think, a 
turning point. The shallowness of the government was on extended 
display. Trudeau may have learned that leadership goes beyond chanting 
pale tag-lines as if they were voodoo spells of oratory. Endless 
muttering of "diversity is our strength" and "growing the middle class" 
is not, after all, the whole of governing.</p>

 right now, it's becoming glaringly obvious the ongoing, two-year-long 
strategy of borrowing a fortune while hoping Alberta's economy does one 
of those bust-to-boom routines is wearing thin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in the springtime, 
there was a little jaunt in the step of the treasurer when he spoke of 
green shoots, followed by a glint in the premier's eye as she waxed 
lyrical about turning some corner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, six months on and 
halfway through this dismal financial year, that jaunt is morphing into a
 limp and the corner looks as though it leads to Dead End Street. Nope, 
things are not rebounding the way the government undoubtedly expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just like our current 
backyards, those green shoots are gone and a season of reckoning is upon
 us. Thoughts of sure-fire, rapid growth are now only for the foolish or
 criminally optimistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which, in political 
terms, means this government's strategy is hitting a brick wall 
comprised of stubbornly high unemployment and dangerously worrisome 
levels of borrowing. Halfway through their mandate and Notley's crew are
 running out of time, because if things don't change soon, they are done
 like the proverbial dinner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month is already proving a nightmare. First came news <span class="companylink">TransCanada Corp</span>.
 is pulling out of the Energy East pipeline project after facing so much
 criticism, political grandstanding and shifting regulatory sands they 
probably breathed a huge sigh of relief despite the disappointment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was no relief in Edmonton, however. This was a body blow to the government's much-ballyhooed <b>social license</b>
 strategy, in which we all get whacked with a carbon tax with the 
explicit promise this would make the rest of Canada all warm and cuddly 
toward Alberta pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nope, that longed-for 
love-in didn't get too far. So now all eyes, and a heck of a lot of 
votes, are tied to measurable progress of the westward-ho pipeline 
project, otherwise known as the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain expansion, a
 project that the government across whose territory it must proceed is 
intent on delaying and ultimately ditching. Yes, our prime minister is 
on board, but remind me again how many federal seats the Grits hold here
 in Alberta?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As if that wasn't bad enough, we had the latest woes our monthly labour statistics provide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news is 
unemployment fell to 7.9 per cent, but delve just slightly below the 
surface and that appears like that old joke about the man who's just 
lost a leg getting a decent offer on his slippers. The reason it went 
down is the labour force fell - at this rate, we'll have nobody out of a
 job because everyone's quit looking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of people 
working in September actually fell by 7,800. Now perish the thought the 
looming minimum wage hike could have had anything to do with that - but 
the fact is the biggest drop came in accommodation and food service 
employment, where many such low-paid jobs reside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No doubt the close to 
8,000 jobs in that sector that vanished in the month prior to the 
mandated pay hike would just be statistical noise to Labour Minister 
Christina Gray. In her cosy world, the metadata is already counted and 
there'll be no turning back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's symptomatic of the bigger problem. Other than hoping <b>oil</b>
 prices suddenly ratchet skyward, there's no other plan to reduce our 
enormous borrowing binge, as any suggestion of trimming spending is 
greeted with shrieks of brutality and heartlessness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except time is running 
out and hope isn't a strategy. So now, in the second half of her 
mandate, Premier Rachel Notley needs to rethink this government's 
policies, because, as in Ecclesiastes 3, there is a time to keep and a 
time to cast away.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DON MARTIN: Welcome back.
 Our Thursday MP combo of diverse political opinion joins us to talk 
pipelines, plaques, and a phoenix which refuses to rise. Ruby Sahota is a
 Liberal MP from Brampton, Michelle Rempel a Conservative MP from 
Calgary, and the pride of Essex, NDP MP Tracey Ramsey. Welcome to you 
all. Michelle, you heard Jim Carr. Tell me what's the view of Calgary on
 this. What's your reaction, Energy East I'm talking about?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MICHELLE
 REMPEL (Conservative – Alberta): You know, if the Liberals wanted to 
completely shut down the energy sector, I wish we would have just had 
that policy discussion, or the courage to have that policy discussion in
 parliament. The reality is between the carbon tax, which is not going 
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, between even the small business tax 
issue this week, the changing of the rules for major energy projects 
which require a large capital investment, certainly the downstream 
emission review on this, like, come on, we're not reviewing Saudi <b>oil</b>
 for that. The tanker moratorium that, they actually shut down debate on
 the tanker moratorium bill after only two opposition speakers this 
week. I could go on and on. The reality is all of these things combined 
is an ideological opposition to the energy sector. You heard Jim Carr 
talk about the pipelines that they approved. Well, we approved four 
pipelines under our government. So that's fact. The other component is 
that the government, they refuse to stand up and acknowledge that many 
First Nations communities actually want some of these pipelines to be 
produced. We already have one of the world's strongest regulatory 
systems in the world, and I wish that they would have just had the 
courage to call it national energy program the second, but they were 
smart enough not to. The unfortunate thing is I think that this is going
 to stoke western alienation. I think that this is going to hurt the 
entire economy writ large, and their talking points are very, very weak 
and they're not cognizant of the reality that the energy sector plays in
 the Canadian economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Okay. It is an 
engine of growth out there. Tracey, where is the NDP coming down on 
Energy East? Is this a business decision or political obstruction? 
TRACEY RAMSEY (NDP – Ontario): Well this isn't a surprise because the 
system is broken that we're using. The process that we're using is 
broken. We've been saying that for a very long time. You have to include
 <b>social license</b>. You have to include the communities that are 
impacted. And here we saw the municipalities saying that they didn't 
want this, having the province weigh in. Like when you have people in a 
community who are objecting to what you're doing, then you have to take a
 serious look at that. Until they fix this process, don, you know, no 
project really is going to go through in the way that it should. It's 
not going to have every single aspect looked at, and know that that 
project is good for Canada. We're happy to see this happen. Obviously 
this is something that we were calling for. But it's not a surprise, and
 it's just another example of how the government needs to listen to the 
people in the communities that are impacted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: So, Ruby, I'm sure you want to weigh in somewhere between those two polar opposites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RUBY SAHOTA (Liberal – 
Ontario): Absolutely. Government has been listening, and therefore 
that's why we have a process that has been working and takes into 
account what Indigenous people are saying. It takes into account the 
issue with the emissions. And we have successfully, under this exact 
same process, the process has not changed regardless of what the 
Conservatives want to sell to people, the process is the same and we've 
approved three pipelines since that time. Two <b>oil</b> pipelines, <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>,
 Line 3, a gas pipeline, Nova Gas, and that's created over 25,000 jobs. 
How many jobs did the Conservatives create in that area? Zero! Because 
you did not, the fact is you did not...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: Whoa, whoa, Ruby, come to Calgary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAHOTA: ...any <b>oil</b> pipelines in ten years. We've approved three.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: Keystone, Anchor 
Loop, the Line Nine reversal. Wrong, wrong, wrong, and the reality is 
that there's over 200,000 people that are out of work in Alberta. So 
anybody in Alberta that's talking about jobs created under the Trudeau 
government are actually going to be throwing tomatoes at their screen 
right now. That is such complete malarkey. And I just wish, again, I 
mean we're going to continue to stand up for the energy sector, but I 
think what everybody is going to be doing today is looking at the 
Trudeau government and saying, look, why didn't you just have the 
courage to stand up and say we don't want this to happen. Why just try 
and trick Canadians into thinking anything otherwise?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAHOTA: We absolutely wanted it to happen. It was a business decision at the end of the day made by <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: But why isn't Canada open for business on this? If it's a business... SAHOTA: We're absolutely open to business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: No, what you've 
done is you've, you have changed the rules on a billion dollar capital 
decision. You have changed the rules on the taxation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: You have changed rules and the context and labour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Go ahead Tracey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RAMSEY: This is an 
example of how broken the process was under the previous Conservative 
government. It continues to be under the Liberals. And until this 
process gets fixed, it has to get fixed. This is broken. We saw the 
social licence today coming to play, communities coming into play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: What exactly is broken about this?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RAMSEY: Listening to 
communities. You have to take into account the communities that this is 
traveling through, not just where it's coming and where it's going 
through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: I got to move on. We're running out of time and I want to get to this issue because the "<span class="companylink">New York Times</span>", the "<span class="companylink">Washington Post</span>", the "Times of Israel", the "<span class="companylink">BBC</span>"
 are all covering the story of the missing mention on our brand new 
national holocaust memorial down there. There's no mention of the Jewish
 population that was exterminated in the gas chambers. All we've got in 
place is that millions of men, women, and children were murdered during 
the holocaust, and the survivors who persevered were able to make their 
way to Canada after one of the darkest chapters in history. The plaque 
didn't mention anything about Jews. It has since been removed. The 
government, like what's your reaction to this?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RAMSEY: This is a very 
serious oversight. You know this, we're glad that it's down, but this is
 a very serious oversight that's hurtful to people who are in Canada who
 are descendants of people who are Jewish who faced anti-Semitism. There
 needs to be an acknowledgment of what exactly happened there, and it 
can't be this kind of just vague reference to the amount of people that 
were murdered in the holocaust, so it needs to be fixed. It's just a 
very unfortunate and really a big mistake by the Liberals not catching 
that this should have been an important piece.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: How can you not 
proofread a plaque, or did they just decide they couldn't single out one
 set of victims and decide just to lump it in as men, women and 
children. What did you think when you heard this?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: I guess two 
points. First to that, you know, if you go to any holocaust memorial 
around the world, be it Yad Vashem, or the American holocaust memorial, 
the communities that built those take great pains to talk about the 
Roma, or Jehovah's Witnesses, or members of the LGBTQ community that 
were also included, but the reality is I think a key component of 
anti-Semitism to this day is people who purport that the Jewish 
community somehow made the holocaust up. And the main way that we can 
fight anti-Semitism is by strongly pushing back, and saying unless we 
recognize how many members of the Jewish community were killed simply 
because of their faith under extreme conditions, the saying never again 
won't actually happen. So, you know, this is a pretty big oversight, and
 one that I'm glad was corrected. But I mean, yes, proofreading a plaque
 should have happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: And a bit of a 
global, I mean laughing stock is the wrong word, but certainly we're 
being held up to ridicule around the globe for this. I mean surely 
someone, who should be held responsible for this, Ruby?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAHOTA: I don't disagree 
with anything my colleagues have said. It is a time in our history that 
needs to be acknowledged, and we need to learn from it. We need to call 
it what it was, and, you know, over six million Jews died, so there was 
no excuse. We really appreciate that (inaudible) flagged the issue right
 away and immediately it was removed. On the monument overall, there are
 over 50 mentions of the Jewish people, but this plaque in particular 
had that oversight, and I don't know how that happened but I'm really 
grateful that it was flagged and removed and it's going to be corrected,
 rightfully so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: I know. Well we 
were supposed to talk phoenix, but I'm out of time. And I think phoenix 
is going to continue to flounder around for a while.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: We just want people to get paid, like me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Are you having trouble getting paid?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: MPs aren't 
supposed to get paid, Don, but, no, I think it's, you know, across party
 lines, this is really affecting a lot of public servants and they need 
to, it needs to be fixed. MARTIN: Okay. Well we'll save the blame game 
for another time. All right, thank you all. Have a great break week and a
 happy Thanksgiving. Coming up, fighting back against the military's 
silent killer. Please stay with us.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next month, Michael Bunz, a 38-year-old salesman supplying chemicals to <b>oil</b> and gas facilities, lay in a shack 80 kilometres from the Galloway house, dead after being exposed to H2S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The official incident 
report filed with the Ministry of the Economy, which regulates 
Saskatchewan's oilfields, makes no mention of Bunz's death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These regulators "are 
really thinking about the economic health of the province," says Emily 
Eaton, a professor at the University of Regina who has studied the 
relationship between the <b>oil</b> industry and the government. Eaton is a member of the Corporate Mapping Project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A shift in 2012 - from 
the Ministry of Energy and Resources to a new Ministry of the Economy 
tasked with regulating natural resource extraction and promoting 
economic development - changed the ministry's role from watchdog to 
partner, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're thinking about 
returns on investment ... The industry should really be regulated by 
those that have the interests of the environment first."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ministry field staff raised this concern at a meeting on July 1, 2015, between government and industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The role of the 
regulator needs to be adjusted," the meeting's minutes read. "The 
regulators are acting as consultants in some situations. The role of the
 regulator is to enforce the rules and if the rules are clear and if 
enforcement is consistent and clear then, 'cultural' changes can be 
made."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its statement, the ministry rejects criticisms of conflict of interest or lax enforcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Within the Ministry of 
the Economy, the petroleum and natural gas division carries out industry
 regulation," wrote the department's spokeswoman, Deb Young. "It is not 
involved in investment attraction, royalty and tax assessment and land 
sales. It is solely focused on well, facility and pipeline regulation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That regulation has not included fines or prosecutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry has not 
issued a single fine against any industry company "for well over a 
decade," Doug MacKnight, assistant deputy minister responsible for 
petroleum and natural gas, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Generally, we don't have
 to resort to that," he said. "It's usually just a notice to the 
operator to bring themselves into compliance."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prosecutions have also 
not been part of the ministry's enforcement practices because 
non-compliance was dealt with "through other enforcement actions," reads
 the ministry's statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other enforcement actions
 include increased inspections and staff, high-tech equipment for 
detecting emissions and a $69-million inspection reporting database 
(which can't be accessed by the public).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, complaints of illness from residents and workers continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I will sometimes get 
faint, like I will fall over and I have to find a seat quickly," says 
Lori Erhardt, a United Church minister and musician living near Oxbow 
who believes her chronic illness is related to&nbsp;emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I have had a variety of 
diagnoses, most of them end with "i-t-i-s," which means inflammation ...
 If something gets inflamed, if it's blood vesicles, you feel it through
 your body."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the five years' 
worth of documents obtained by this investigation is an April 2012 
PowerPoint presentation to CAPP members by the director of the 
province's petroleum and natural gas division. It includes a map of 
southeastern Saskatchewan showing a bloom of red and orange circles, 
labelled "critical sour gas locations."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sources say ministry 
staff pushed to make the data public but senior government officials 
said "there's no goddamn way that is going to be released," according to
 the former ministry source.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's an institutional
 reluctance to make this information public," he said. "The public 
should be able to see all the information that legislators have 
identified as public information such as sour gas and inspection 
reports."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry statement 
says the map was never approved for release because some data was out of
 date, not comprehensive and "could provide the public and industry with
 a false understanding of risk associated with a particular well or 
facility."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the Galloway incident, the ministry inspected 11 <b>oil</b>
 and gas facilities. All failed "with serious infractions," including 
releasing H2S at lethal levels "that may be exceeding 150,000 (parts per
 million)," Brad Herald, CAPP's Saskatchewan operations manager, wrote 
to the board of governors in December 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those levels are 150 times the amount that could cause instant death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the causes: "It is 
believed that inadequate training on the installation and operation of 
equipment is ... contributing to the air quality issues."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPP's Abel said in an interview the "unsafe" facilities responsible for those breaches should not have been operating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They should have been 
shut down," he said. "When you follow the rules, processing and 
production of sour gas is absolutely safe. If you don't follow the 
rules, it can pose a health risk. So ultimately, those operators at 
those facilities were responsible."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither CAPP nor its industry partners made the health risks public. And no ministry fines or prosecutions followed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Internally, CAPP quickly mobilized to develop a public relations and damage control plan:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are growing public
 concerns regarding the air quality issues in southeast Saskatchewan," 
Herald wrote, noting a petition and a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Ministry fields one 
to two public complaints concerning odours per week and the issue is 
garnering increasing political attention . . . This has the potential to
 become a broader industry reputation/<b>social license</b> concern and 
warrants immediate attention by operators in the region . . . 
Communications is preparing key messages in the event that there is 
media profile."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPP received a warning 
the next month after consulting a scientist with expertise on managing 
toxic substances, internal emails show. The scientist expressed 
disappointment noting that H2S failures were "so easy to avoid."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientist urged the 
industry lobby group to develop and implement a new code of practice to 
control dangerous emissions and get ahead of the problem by publicly 
denouncing unacceptable practices. The scientist also recommended that 
the industry group pressure the province to step up inspections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry, in meetings with industry, proposed similar reforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter sent in March
 2013 then-energy minister Tim McMillan - now president and CEO of CAPP -
 warned companies to meet "compliance obligations" or face "escalated 
enforcement, penalty and/or prosecution."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ministry and industry met
 four times between 2012 and 2014 to plot strategy, including emergency 
planning zones, a public communications document, a code of practice and
 a licensing regime for high-risk, single-well batteries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those plans were never adopted, a ministry statement confirms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Instead, the Ministry 
chose to take a risk-based approach to managing the sour gas issue that 
included increased field inspections and improved data collection." 
Eighteen wells that had been venting sour gas were ordered to be 
"shut-in" in 2012/2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 2013 to the summer 
of 2014, the ministry began implementing "an aggressive inspection and 
enforcement schedule to reduce sour gas emission" that included 
suspension orders against 30 facilities owing to "H2S management 
issues," the statement reads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During that effort, H2S would claim its most high-profile victim in Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Bunz, a salesman 
for Nalco Champion, died on May 22, 2014, while taking samples in a shed
 located in a provincial park between Carlyle and Kipling. A valve on 
the tank broke and <b>oil</b>, water and H2S spewed into his face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An incident report submitted by the tank's owner, <span class="companylink">Harvest Operations Corp</span>., states simply: "Spill occurred as a result of a failed valve."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nowhere does it mention Bunz's death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, his death is 
marked by a gravestone in a small cemetery near Wawota, where the father
 of two young daughters lived a few doors away from his parents, Dianne 
and Allan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The black, polished 
stone, with an image of Bunz wearing his Saskatchewan Roughriders jersey
 and hat, calls him "Bunzy" and reads: "In loving memory of Emma and 
Olivia's Daddy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He didn't really talk about those dangers," Dianne says. "We knew what it's like to work in the <b>oil</b> industry. My husband did for 20 years. We knew about H2S but I wasn't aware that he was going on site and doing the testing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The summer before he 
died, Allan drove his son to the Nalco office to quit. Michael's 
brother-in-law, who had worked there, had left and "things had been 
pretty tough," Michael said, marked by long days and heavy workload.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He was going to hand his
 company truck in, and his boss was there ... he talked (Michael) out of
 it," Allan says. "This company wanted him because he never ever phoned 
in sick or anything. He'd just go to work. And they offered him more 
money, so he stayed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nalco Champion is facing 
three charges under the province's occupational health and safety 
legislation for failing to provide Bunz with a respirator and to ensure 
he entered a dangerous situation with a second worker. A conviction 
would result in a fine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family says they were
 told by Nalco that the concentration of H2S in the fluids was estimated
 at 40,000 parts per million, more than enough to bring near-instant 
death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company sent reporters a written statement, declining further comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We remain deeply 
saddened by the loss of our colleague, Michael Bunz. The safety of our 
associates, customers and communities is vitally important, and we 
remain committed to our robust safety policies, protocols and training 
programs, which include those related to hydrogen sulfide," it reads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allan, who spent most of his working life in the <b>oil</b> industry, says he learned more about H2S protection when he worked on a pig farm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Every person had to wear
 an H2S monitor. And I'm talking about the pig industry," he says. "To 
me, they were protecting us ... more at this simple small hog operation 
in Saskatchewan than the <b>oil</b> industry ever did the entire time I was working out there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple reviewed the 
records documenting years of discussions between government and industry
 about public health risks and failed audits that were never made 
public. The couple called it "devastating."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I go to work every day 
and I drive down the highway and I talk to my son sitting beside me," 
says Allan. "I say to him "tough day there, son" and I tell him how I 
feel . . . I feel him sitting there beside me."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How often H2S incidents happen or happened in Saskatchewan remains a mystery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officially, ministry 
officials count one death and five "documented incidents where a member 
of the public was exposed to unsafe levels of sour gas near a well or 
facility site."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of them triggered a public statement by the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There was no need for public notification since the incident was quickly dealt with at the site," reads the ministry statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after dozens of 
interviews it is clear that H2S incidents involving residents are more 
common but go unreported or are not recorded properly. This is also true
 for workers in the oilfield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only months after Bunz 
died, Trina Hansen, an oilfield worker and part-time voice actress, was 
clearing a pipeline near Carlyle, Sask.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I could have died," she 
says. "It's almost like you could feel like a heavy air hit your face. 
It's a really weird feeling. Your first reaction is to inhale. When it 
hits your face, you breathe it in. It's the weirdest thing. You don't 
think to hold your breath. It happens so fast. I stumbled backwards. I 
was so shocked."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disoriented, Hansen got 
back in her truck and drove a couple of kilometres until she noticed she
 was losing her peripheral vision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There were white 
sparkles, iridescent, swirly, super-shiny and bright. I jumped out and 
started feeling nauseous and couldn't breathe very well. I was trying to
 catch my breath and dry heaving. My head started pounding."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hansen, suffering debilitating headaches, nausea and sickness, lost her voice for two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This happened three 
years ago and I still have a hard time catching my breath if I talk too 
fast. I'm very short of breath. I've never in my life felt like that. It
 was horrible."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her voice has changed for good - it is far deeper and lower than before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I do a cartoon on APTN 
network and they said my voice totally changed. It changed two octaves 
pretty much. It used to be high and now it cuts out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hansen never reported the incident, fearing she would lose her job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Nobody wants to say 
anything. We know it's bad and dangerous. But no one wants to raise a 
fuss. And being a woman and trying to prove yourself out there, I never 
claimed WCB (Workers Compensation Board). The economy went down and I 
have to pay off debt with my trucking money."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four months after Bunz's 
death, a secret ministry report listed 161 facilities "that may be in 
violation of (the ministry's) sour gas emission control."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The catch: "time and 
resources required to investigate and verify violations would take all 
available field officers over a year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2014, inspections of 
60 suspicious wells in 2014 turned up 36 - more than half - that were 
leaking so badly they had to be shut down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another audit found 11 
out of 12 facilities failed inspection "due to H2S venting" and found 29
 locations that are too close to facilities with high levels of H2S 
concentrations. Of the 1,352 active sour gas facilities, only 421 - 31 
per cent - had "proper emission control systems."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Almost every site had 
improper gas measurement," the report reads. "Discovered major 
contamination at two facilities as a result of spill which were not 
reported" to the ministry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry believes 
that the H2S issue is under control, saying air quality standards are 
being met and that inspections confirm that companies' sour gas 
management practices have improved. Today 27 full-time inspectors are 
responsible for the province's 126,000 wells and its estimated 118,000 
kilometres of pipelines and flowlines, operating with a budget of $3.9 
million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2016-17, ministry staff inspected 18,340 wells, facilities and pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, a team of 
researchers from Harvard and Northeastern Universities collected data in
 collaboration with this investigation using the same instruments 
employed by ministry inspectors to detect emissions invisible to the 
naked eye.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In my experience measuring <b>oil</b>
 and gas activities in Texas, what struck me was that about a third of 
the sites we looked at had what we believed to be fugitive emissions and
 the high density of pump jacks," says Lourdes Vera, a doctoral student 
in environmental sociology at <span class="companylink">Northeastern University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Michanowicz, a 
post-doctoral researcher at Harvard University's School of Public Health
 who led the survey in Saskatchewan, said about one in five of the 
facilities they visited showed black smoke rising from the flaring 
stacks of production facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If there is black smoke,
 there is particulate matter that if inhaled is certainly associated 
with human health effects," he said. "If sources of these air pollutants
 are constantly impacting individuals where they live, work and play, 
there is the worry that they are experiencing health effects."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In interviews with 
landowners and records in the government database, this investigation 
has found recent H2S accidents, including three people who say they were
 sickened by H2S clouds near their homes in the past year. One said they
 required hospitalization after a near-fatal incident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, more than 
four years after the H2S incident in Galloway's front yard, she and her 
husband were driving home when they encountered a plume of what she 
believes was H2S gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She fell ill and stayed home for three days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've had arrhythmias, really wicked headaches ... I've had bouts of nausea. I wake up at night and have heart palpitations."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Galloway wrote to public officials demanding a response.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were no 
consequences or fines as a result. And no official report of an incident
 anywhere near the Galloway property that day was filed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, says Galloway, is just the way it works in Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As a person living in 
the middle of the oilfield, you have no protection. The government 
doesn't care. Your MLA doesn't care. The <b>oil</b> companies don't care."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unprecedented Collaboration Behind the Project</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the past nine 
months, an unprecedented collaboration of more than 50 journalists and 
editors from three Canadian media outlets, four journalism schools and a
 think tank have worked to chronicle the hidden price of <b>oil</b> in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Collectively, reporters 
examined thousands of industry and government documents, analyzed 
terabytes of data and delved into dozens of freedom-of-information 
requests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The project started with
 the people," says Patti Sonntag, a managing editor in the New York 
Times' news services division, who launched the project with a grant 
from the Michener Awards Foundation. Following a tip from a colleague at
 the Corporate Mapping Project, she did some research and reporting in 
Saskatchewan last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working with the previous
 year's Michener winner, Toronto Star journalist Robert Cribb, Sonntag 
created a team of students at the Ryerson, Concordia and UBC journalism 
schools. <span class="companylink">Concordia University</span>'s Department of Journalism volunteered to act as host and headquarters for the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">University of Regina 
students reported on the ground locally, shot video and developed 
sources, while students at the other universities aggregated and 
analyzed data and interviewed experts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're pulling these four
 different schools from across the country and looking at it from all 
different aspects," says Janelle Blakley, a University of Regina student
 reporter whose team mapped spills data and met local farmers and 
residents. "This collaboration allowed us to really dig into it, where 
all schools were pulling apart different pieces of it and then coming 
back and putting it all together."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The significance of the 
data quickly drew intrigue. What emerged was a picture of a few 
dedicated regulators - and even some industry leaders - who tried to 
introduce greater accountability, but these efforts were ultimately 
overwhelmed by larger forces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You start to understand 
these figures really do play a huge role in dictating the direction of 
the Canadian economy and that plays out in the lives of everyday 
Canadians," says Lauren Kaljur, a graduate of UBC's master of journalism
 program who has been investigating the concentration of corporate power
 in Saskatchewan's <b>oil</b> and gas industry since the beginning of 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Matthew Gilmour, a recent journalism graduate at <span class="companylink">Concordia University</span>,
 after spending months populating spreadsheets and ledgers, "there's the
 human moment where you realize it's not just a pocketbook story. It's a
 human story. And people's lives are affected."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work continued past 
the end of the semester in April 2017, with students working alongside 
veteran reporters at the Star, the National Observer and Global News to 
shape the stories, seek comments from all sides and publish hundreds of 
pages of government and industry records, detailing concerns about 
potentially deadly gas emissions for the first time.&nbsp;- Steph

Saskatchewan has strengthened its sour gas

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Documents obtained 
through freedom-of-information requests and from whistleblowers — 
internal correspondence, meeting minutes, presentations and inspection 
reports — disclose findings of failures in performance by <b>oil</b> and
 gas companies, including serious infractions, failed safety audits, 
daily H2S readings beyond provincial air quality standards and a death 
in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet regulatory standards remain largely unchanged and H2S incidents and risks remain hidden from the public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The teen overcome in Galloway's yard eventually recovered but missed school for several days with nausea and headaches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">H2S can be an insidious killer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heavier than air, it tends to settle in ravines and valleys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just above the level 
Galloway's monitor detected — 100 parts per million — H2S causes 
olfactory paralysis, leaving a victim unable to detect the rotten-egg 
smell. Continued exposure at that level may cause death within 48 hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A person exposed to a 
highly concentrated plume of the gas — at 1,000 parts per million — may 
die rapidly from respiratory paralysis, or over the course of days, from
 an inflammatory reaction in the lungs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Victims effectively suffocate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government issued no 
public warning after Galloway reported the plume at her home because 
“there was no evidence that this was a widespread failure.” But inside 
government and industry offices, documents indicate the seriousness of 
H2S issues that led to years of meetings, audits and proposed regulatory
 reforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On April 7, 2014, 
government and industry officials deliberated about releasing data that 
showed H2S “hotspots” across southeastern Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Government may be 
accused of hiding information,” the notes read. “Public will want to 
know: 1. What are the areas? 2. How is it managed? 3. How is the 
government making sure it's managed?” one unnamed official told the 
meeting. “Are we creating a risk by not releasing this data 
immediately?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite acknowledging 
“significant” public health risks from H2S, at least some officials 
present expressed concern about “sensitivity in this data (because) 
there are residents living in these areas.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No release followed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three weeks later, 
government-proposed fines for emission breaches — up to $1 million in 
penalties — were rejected by two major industry groups. In a letter to 
the ministry dated April 29, 2014, the <span class="companylink">Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) </span>and Explorers and Producers Association of Canada (EPAC) called the proposed penalties “unsuitable.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A former ministry 
official, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of losing his 
current job in the industry, says “almost every amendment was being 
rejected.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EPAC officials declined comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terry Abel, CAPP's 
spokesperson, said the letter was intended to explain that, “in some 
cases, fines aren't appropriate at all … If there's an unsafe operation,
 it should be shut down. It shouldn't be operating. That's the best way 
to ensure the public safety is protected.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed fines were dropped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next month, Michael Bunz, a 38-year-old salesman supplying chemicals to <b>oil</b> and gas facilities, lay in a shack 80 kilometres from the Galloway house, dead after being exposed to H2S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The official incident 
report filed with the Ministry of the Economy, which regulates 
Saskatchewan's oilfields, makes no mention of Bunz's death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These regulators “are 
really thinking about the economic health of the province,” says Emily 
Eaton, a professor at the University of Regina who has studied the 
relationship between the <b>oil</b> industry and the government. Eaton is a member of the Corporate Mapping Project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A shift in 2012 — from 
the Ministry of Energy and Resources to a new Ministry of the Economy 
tasked with regulating natural resource extraction and promoting 
economic development — changed the ministry's role from watchdog to 
partner, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They're thinking about 
returns on investment … The industry should really be regulated by those
 that have the interests of the environment first.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ministry field staff raised this concern at a meeting on July 1, 2015, between government and industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The role of the 
regulator needs to be adjusted,” the meeting's minutes read. “The 
regulators are acting as consultants in some situations. The role of the
 regulator is to enforce the rules and if the rules are clear and if 
enforcement is consistent and clear then, 'cultural' changes can be 
made.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its statement, the ministry rejects criticisms of conflict of interest or lax enforcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Within the Ministry of 
the Economy, the petroleum and natural gas division carries out industry
 regulation,” wrote the department's spokeswoman, Deb Young. “It is not 
involved in investment attraction, royalty and tax assessment and land 
sales. It is solely focused on well, facility and pipeline regulation.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That regulation has not included fines or prosecutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry has not 
issued a single fine against any industry company “for well over a 
decade,” Doug MacKnight, assistant deputy minister responsible for 
petroleum and natural gas, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Generally, we don't have
 to resort to that,” he said. “It's usually just a notice to the 
operator to bring themselves into compliance.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prosecutions have also 
not been part of the ministry's enforcement practices because 
non-compliance was dealt with “through other enforcement actions,” reads
 the ministry's statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other enforcement actions
 include increased inspections and staff, high-tech equipment for 
detecting emissions and a $69-million inspection reporting database 
(which can't be accessed by the public).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, complaints of illness from residents and workers continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I will sometimes get 
faint, like I will fall over and I have to find a seat quickly,” says 
Lori Erhardt, a United Church minister and musician living near Oxbow 
who believes her chronic illness is related to emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I have had a variety of 
diagnoses, most of them end with “i-t-i-s,” which means inflammation … 
If something gets inflamed, if it's blood vesicles, you feel it through 
your body.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the five years' 
worth of documents obtained by this investigation is an April 2012 
PowerPoint presentation to CAPP members by the director of the 
province's petroleum and natural gas division. It includes a map of 
southeastern Saskatchewan showing a bloom of red and orange circles, 
labelled “critical sour gas locations.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sources say ministry 
staff pushed to make the data public but senior government officials 
said “there's no goddamn way that is going to be released,” according to
 the former ministry source.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's an institutional
 reluctance to make this information public,” he said. “The public 
should be able to see all the information that legislators have 
identified as public information such as sour gas and inspection 
reports.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry statement 
says the map was never approved for release because some data was out of
 date, not comprehensive and “could provide the public and industry with
 a false understanding of risk associated with a particular well or 
facility.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the Galloway incident, the ministry inspected 11 <b>oil</b>
 and gas facilities. All failed “with serious infractions,” including 
releasing H2S at lethal levels “that may be exceeding 150,000 (parts per
 million),” Brad Herald, CAPP's Saskatchewan operations manager, wrote 
to the board of governors in December 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those levels are 150 times the amount that could cause instant death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the causes: “It is 
believed that inadequate training on the installation and operation of 
equipment is … contributing to the air quality issues.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPP's Abel said in an interview the “unsafe” facilities responsible for those breaches should not have been operating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They should have been 
shut down,” he said. “When you follow the rules, processing and 
production of sour gas is absolutely safe. If you don't follow the 
rules, it can pose a health risk. So ultimately, those operators at 
those facilities were responsible.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither CAPP nor its industry partners made the health risks public. And no ministry fines or prosecutions followed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Internally, CAPP quickly mobilized to develop a public relations and damage control plan:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are growing public
 concerns regarding the air quality issues in southeast Saskatchewan,” 
Herald wrote, noting a petition and a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The Ministry fields one 
to two public complaints concerning odours per week and the issue is 
garnering increasing political attention . . . This has the potential to
 become a broader industry reputation/<b>social license</b> concern and 
warrants immediate attention by operators in the region . . . 
Communications is preparing key messages in the event that there is 
media profile.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPP received a warning 
the next month after consulting a scientist with expertise on managing 
toxic substances, internal emails show. The scientist expressed 
disappointment noting that H2S failures were “so easy to avoid.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientist urged the 
industry lobby group to develop and implement a new code of practice to 
control dangerous emissions and get ahead of the problem by publicly 
denouncing unacceptable practices. The scientist also recommended that 
the industry group pressure the province to step up inspections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry, in meetings with industry, proposed similar reforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter sent in March
 2013 then-energy minister Tim McMillan — now president and CEO of CAPP —
 warned companies to meet “compliance obligations” or face “escalated 
enforcement, penalty and/or prosecution.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ministry and industry met
 four times between 2012 and 2014 to plot strategy, including emergency 
planning zones, a public communications document, a code of practice and
 a licensing regime for high-risk, single-well batteries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those plans were never adopted, a ministry statement confirms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Instead, the Ministry 
chose to take a risk-based approach to managing the sour gas issue that 
included increased field inspections and improved data collection.” 
Eighteen wells that had been venting sour gas were ordered to be 
“shut-in” in 2012/2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 2013 to the summer 
of 2014, the ministry began implementing “an aggressive inspection and 
enforcement schedule to reduce sour gas emission” that included 
suspension orders against 30 facilities owing to “H2S management 
issues,” the statement reads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During that effort, H2S would claim its most high-profile victim in Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Bunz, a salesman 
for Nalco Champion, died on May 22, 2014, while taking samples in a shed
 located in a provincial park between Carlyle and Kipling. A valve on 
the tank broke and <b>oil</b>, water and H2S spewed into his face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An incident report submitted by the tank's owner, <span class="companylink">Harvest Operations Corp</span>., states simply: “Spill occurred as a result of a failed valve.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nowhere does it mention Bunz's death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, his death is 
marked by a gravestone in a small cemetery near Wawota, where the father
 of two young daughters lived a few doors away from his parents, Dianne 
and Allan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The black, polished 
stone, with an image of Bunz wearing his Saskatchewan Roughriders jersey
 and hat, calls him “Bunzy” and reads: “In loving memory of Emma and 
Olivia's Daddy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He didn't really talk about those dangers,” Dianne says. “We knew what it's like to work in the <b>oil</b> industry. My husband did for 20 years. We knew about H2S but I wasn't aware that he was going on site and doing the testing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The summer before he 
died, Allan drove his son to the Nalco office to quit. Michael's 
brother-in-law, who had worked there, had left and “things had been 
pretty tough,” Michael said, marked by long days and heavy workload.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He was going to hand his
 company truck in, and his boss was there … he talked (Michael) out of 
it,” Allan says. “This company wanted him because he never ever phoned 
in sick or anything. He'd just go to work. And they offered him more 
money, so he stayed.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nalco Champion is facing 
three charges under the province's occupational health and safety 
legislation for failing to provide Bunz with a respirator and to ensure 
he entered a dangerous situation with a second worker. A conviction 
would result in a fine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family says they were
 told by Nalco that the concentration of H2S in the fluids was estimated
 at 40,000 parts per million, more than enough to bring near-instant 
death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company sent reporters a written statement, declining further comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We remain deeply 
saddened by the loss of our colleague, Michael Bunz. The safety of our 
associates, customers and communities is vitally important, and we 
remain committed to our robust safety policies, protocols and training 
programs, which include those related to hydrogen sulfide,” it reads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allan, who spent most of his working life in the <b>oil</b> industry, says he learned more about H2S protection when he worked on a pig farm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Every person had to wear
 an H2S monitor. And I'm talking about the pig industry,” he says. “To 
me, they were protecting us … more at this simple small hog operation in
 Saskatchewan than the <b>oil</b> industry ever did the entire time I was working out there.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple reviewed the 
records documenting years of discussions between government and industry
 about public health risks and failed audits that were never made 
public. The couple called it “devastating.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I go to work every day 
and I drive down the highway and I talk to my son sitting beside me,” 
says Allan. “I say to him “tough day there, son” and I tell him how I 
feel . . . I feel him sitting there beside me.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How often H2S incidents happen or happened in Saskatchewan remains a mystery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officially, ministry 
officials count one death and five “documented incidents where a member 
of the public was exposed to unsafe levels of sour gas near a well or 
facility site.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of them triggered a public statement by the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There was no need for public notification since the incident was quickly dealt with at the site,” reads the ministry statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after dozens of 
interviews it is clear that H2S incidents involving residents are more 
common but go unreported or are not recorded properly. This is also true
 for workers in the oilfield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only months after Bunz 
died, Trina Hansen, an oilfield worker and part-time voice actress, was 
clearing a pipeline near Carlyle, Sask.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I could have died,” she 
says. “It's almost like you could feel like a heavy air hit your face. 
It's a really weird feeling. Your first reaction is to inhale. When it 
hits your face, you breathe it in. It's the weirdest thing. You don't 
think to hold your breath. It happens so fast. I stumbled backwards. I 
was so shocked.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disoriented, Hansen got 
back in her truck and drove a couple of kilometres until she noticed she
 was losing her peripheral vision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There were white 
sparkles, iridescent, swirly, super-shiny and bright. I jumped out and 
started feeling nauseous and couldn't breathe very well. I was trying to
 catch my breath and dry heaving. My head started pounding.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hansen, suffering debilitating headaches, nausea and sickness, lost her voice for two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This happened three 
years ago and I still have a hard time catching my breath if I talk too 
fast. I'm very short of breath. I've never in my life felt like that. It
 was horrible.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her voice has changed for good — it is far deeper and lower than before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I do a cartoon on <span class="companylink">APTN</span> network and they said my voice totally changed. It changed two octaves pretty much. It used to be high and now it cuts out.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hansen never reported the incident, fearing she would lose her job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Nobody wants to say 
anything. We know it's bad and dangerous. But no one wants to raise a 
fuss. And being a woman and trying to prove yourself out there, I never 
claimed WCB (Workers Compensation Board). The economy went down and I 
have to pay off debt with my trucking money.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four months after Bunz's 
death, a secret ministry report listed 161 facilities “that may be in 
violation of (the ministry's) sour gas emission control.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The catch: “time and 
resources required to investigate and verify violations would take all 
available field officers over a year.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2014, inspections of 
60 suspicious wells in 2014 turned up 36 — more than half — that were 
leaking so badly they had to be shut down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another audit found 11 
out of 12 facilities failed inspection “due to H2S venting” and found 29
 locations that are too close to facilities with high levels of H2S 
concentrations. Of the 1,352 active sour gas facilities, only 421 — 31 
per cent — had “proper emission control systems.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Almost every site had 
improper gas measurement,” the report reads. “Discovered major 
contamination at two facilities as a result of spill which were not 
reported” to the ministry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry believes 
that the H2S issue is under control, saying air quality standards are 
being met and that inspections confirm that companies' sour gas 
management practices have improved. Today 27 full-time inspectors are 
responsible for the province's 126,000 wells and its estimated 118,000 
kilometres of pipelines and flowlines, operating with a budget of $3.9 
million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2016-17, ministry staff inspected 18,340 wells, facilities and pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, a team of 
researchers from Harvard and Northeastern Universities collected data in
 collaboration with this investigation using the same instruments 
employed by ministry inspectors to detect emissions invisible to the 
naked eye.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In my experience measuring <b>oil</b>
 and gas activities in Texas, what struck me was that about a third of 
the sites we looked at had what we believed to be fugitive emissions and
 the high density of pump jacks,” says Lourdes Vera, a doctoral student 
in environmental sociology at <span class="companylink">Northeastern University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Michanowicz, a 
post-doctoral researcher at Harvard University's School of Public Health
 who led the survey in Saskatchewan, said about one in five of the 
facilities they visited showed black smoke rising from the flaring 
stacks of production facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If there is black smoke,
 there is particulate matter that if inhaled is certainly associated 
with human health effects,” he said. “If sources of these air pollutants
 are constantly impacting individuals where they live, work and play, 
there is the worry that they are experiencing health effects.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In interviews with 
landowners and records in the government database, this investigation 
has found recent H2S accidents, including three people who say they were
 sickened by H2S clouds near their homes in the past year. One said they
 required hospitalization after a near-fatal incident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, more than 
four years after the H2S incident in Galloway's front yard, she and her 
husband were driving home when they encountered a plume of what she 
believes was H2S gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She fell ill and stayed home for three days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I've had arrhythmias, really wicked headaches … I've had bouts of nausea. I wake up at night and have heart palpitations.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Galloway wrote to public officials demanding a response.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were no 
consequences or fines as a result. And no official report of an incident
 anywhere near the Galloway property that day was filed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, says Galloway, is just the way it works in Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As a person living in 
the middle of the oilfield, you have no protection. The government 
doesn't care. Your MLA doesn't care. The <b>oil</b> companies don't care.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unprecedented Collaboration Behind the Project</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the past nine 
months, an unprecedented collaboration of more than 50 journalists and 
editors from three Canadian media outlets, four journalism schools and a
 think tank have worked to chronicle the hidden price of <b>oil</b> in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Collectively, reporters 
examined thousands of industry and government documents, analyzed 
terabytes of data and delved into dozens of freedom-of-information 
requests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The project started with the people,” says Patti Sonntag, a managing editor in the <span class="companylink">New York Times</span>'
 news services division, who launched the project with a grant from the 
Michener Awards Foundation. Following a tip from a colleague at the 
Corporate Mapping Project, she did some research and reporting in 
Saskatchewan last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working with the previous
 year's Michener winner, Toronto Star journalist Robert Cribb, Sonntag 
created a team of students at the Ryerson, Concordia and UBC journalism 
schools. <span class="companylink">Concordia University</span>'s Department of Journalism volunteered to act as host and headquarters for the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">University of Regina 
students reported on the ground locally, shot video and developed 
sources, while students at the other universities aggregated and 
analyzed data and interviewed experts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're pulling these four
 different schools from across the country and looking at it from all 
different aspects,” says Janelle Blakley, a University of Regina student
 reporter whose team mapped spills data and met local farmers and 
residents. “This collaboration allowed us to really dig into it, where 
all schools were pulling apart different pieces of it and then coming 
back and putting it all together.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The significance of the 
data quickly drew intrigue. What emerged was a picture of a few 
dedicated regulators — and even some industry leaders — who tried to 
introduce greater accountability, but these efforts were ultimately 
overwhelmed by larger forces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You start to understand 
these figures really do play a huge role in dictating the direction of 
the Canadian economy and that plays out in the lives of everyday 
Canadians,” says Lauren Kaljur, a graduate of UBC's master of journalism
 program who has been investigating the concentration of corporate power
 in Saskatchewan's <b>oil</b> and gas industry since the beginning of 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Matthew Gilmour, a recent journalism graduate at <span class="companylink">Concordia University</span>,
 after spending months populating spreadsheets and ledgers, “there's the
 human moment where you realize it's not just a pocketbook story. It's a
 human story. And people's lives are affected.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work continued past 
the end of the semester in April 2017, with students working alongside 
veteran reporters at the Star, the National Observer and Global News to 
shape the stories, seek comments from all sides and publish hundreds of 
pages of government and industry records, detailing concerns about 
potentially deadly gas emissions for the first time. — Steph Wechsler/

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Alberta opts for a 
Conservative premier in 2019, the rest of Canada should brace itself for
 for an era of constitutional wrangling and inter-provincial conflict 
unseen since the 1970s.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All
 four potential leaders of the newly formed United Conservative Party - 
the product of a union between the province's Progressive Conservative 
and Wildrose parties, and the most likely threat to NDP premier Rachel 
Notley's reelection - have spent the campaign to date taking hard lines 
on trade, taxes and everything Ottawa. During the first debate between 
leadership candidates last week, a packed hall of revitalized provincial
 conservative die-hards cheered loudest when the candidates promised 
trade wars and constitutional legal battles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Responding to a question 
about the beleaguered Trans Mountain Pipeline, for example - which 
B.C.'s new NDP government has vowed to oppose - Calgary lawyer and 
would-be UCP leader Doug Schweitzer threatened to kick B.C. out of the 
New West Partnership Trade Agreement, and bellowed: "Our economy is 
stronger than B.C's. If they want to get into a trade war, bring it on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former MP and federal 
cabinet minister Jason Kenney, the race's front-runner, and former 
Wildrose leader Brian Jean have also proposed using an arcane <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>
 ruling to force a re-negotiation of the federal equalization program, 
which transfers money to "have-not" provinces with the intention of 
assuring equal levels of government services across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Alberta continues to suffer an <b>oil</b>-bust
 economic downturn, a Conservative premier would rankle much of the rest
 of Confederation on behalf of a province increasingly embittered by 
pipeline politics. It's the kind of muscular approach employed by 
premiers like Peter Lougheed and Ralph Klein, both of whom maintain a 
kind of mythical status in Alberta for their willingness to square off 
against Ottawa and the other provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's certainly an 
opportunity for a Conservative Albertan to flex his or her muscles. The 
environmental movement is intractably opposed to the development of 
Alberta's <b>oil</b> sands, opposition from other premiers to pipelines like Trans Mountain and Energy East threaten Alberta's ability to sell its <b>oil</b> in the U.S. and abroad. Meanwhile, under Justin Trudeau, the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>
 has expanded its mandate, stating that it will consider both upstream 
and downstream greenhouse gas emissions as part of the regulatory 
process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If B.C., Ontario and 
Quebec continue to oppose pipeline construction, and the federal 
government proves unwilling to use its powers to make the projects 
happen, there is little reason for Albertans to play nice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The change at the <span class="companylink">NEB</span> was sold as a bid to gain the kind of "<b>social license</b>" necessary to earn Alberta's <b>oil</b>
 industry the good will to expand; current NDP premier Rachel Notley has
 also invested in this more conciliatory approach, adopting a hard cap 
on greenhouse gas emissions in the <b>oil</b> sands and introducing a carbon tax. But from the Conservative point of view, the quest for <b>social license</b>
 has proved fruitless; if B.C., Ontario and Quebec continue to oppose 
pipeline construction, and the federal government proves unwilling to 
use its powers to make the projects happen, there is little reason for 
Albertans to play nice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that is where Kenney and Jean's constitutional threats come into play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In 1998, the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>
 made a decision in what is called the Quebec Succession reference in 
which it determined that if a province holds a referendum on a 
constitutional question and if it is adopted by a clear majority on a 
clear question, there is a binding constitutional obligation on the 
federal government to negotiate that issue with the relevant province," 
Kenney said after last week's debate. "If the federal government pursues
 a tax on our energy industry - the carbon tax - if it doesn't roll back
 the <span class="companylink">NEB</span>'s outrageous expansion of its 
mandate, and if it refuses to fundamentally change the equalization 
formula in 2019 I would be prepared to hold a referendum."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to several 
legal experts, this is no mere idle threat. But constitutional law is 
more complicated than soundbites allow, and the real question is whether
 triggering such a referendum would amount to anything more than a 
temporary legal headache for the federal government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To craft this proposal, 
Kenney relied on a paper published by retired University of Calgary 
political science professor and former Alberta cabinet minister Ted 
Morton, who said a referendum would likely force the federal government 
to negotiate on a constitutional issue in good faith. However, Morton 
concedes, a negotiation doesn't mean that that Ottawa would be forced to
 cede any of Alberta's demands; additionally, any actual changes to the 
constitution would require the support of seven provinces containing 50 
per cent of the population, as per the amending formula.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It would be a chance for
 those arguments to be put on the table, and who knows. Justin Trudeau 
might see opportunities for some reform," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the principle of 
equalization is enshrined in the constitution, the actual formula by 
which the transfer is calculated is a matter of federal legislation, and
 one that is up for review in 2019. The mere threat of a constitutional 
renegotiation might be enough to earn Alberta some concessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first debate: The 
four men vying to lead Alberta's new United Conservative Party( 
http://nationalpost.com/news/politics/four-candidates-vying-to-lead-new-alberta-party-to-face-off-in-first-debate[http://nationalpost.com/news/politics/four-candidates-vying-to-lead-new-alberta-party-to-face-off-in-first-debate]
 )</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Ivison: Trudeau's 
Liberals have kept all the pipeline promises they intended to keep( 
http://nationalpost.com/news/politics/john-ivison-trudeaus-liberals-have-kept-all-the-pipeline-promises-they-intended-to-keep[http://nationalpost.com/news/politics/john-ivison-trudeaus-liberals-have-kept-all-the-pipeline-promises-they-intended-to-keep]
 )</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if it did, however, 
University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe warns that there is no 
likely new equalization formula that would make any substantive 
improvements to the red ink on Alberta's balance sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if Alberta were able
 to exclude resource revenue from the equalization equation, "we have 
the highest level of fiscal capacity of any province," Tombe said. "I 
think there's lots of sensible changes that could be made, but Albertans
 shouldn't be under the illusion that it would improve our own fiscal 
situation. Changing the formula affects how equalization funds are 
allocated among have-not provinces, and we are not going to be a have 
not province."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short, all this 
bluster from Conservative candidates would likely amount to little more 
than political theatre. But what theatre it could be.</p>

<span class="companylink">Petrolympic Ltd</span>. ("Petrolympic" or the 
"Company") (TSX.V: PCQ, OTCQB: PCQRF) acknowledges that an important 
mile step has been accomplished by the Ministry of Energy and Natural 
Resources of Quebec who published, on Sept. 20, 2017, the draft 
regulations to govern <b>oil</b> and natural gas activities.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Petrolympic
 considers that the Quebec government is sending a strong message in 
releasing these regulations, confirming its will to strengthen the 
economic dynamism of the province in the absolute respect of the 
environment and of the local stakeholders, through the development of a 
robust <b>oil</b> and gas industry. These regulations will govern and 
clarify the exploration, production and storage licencing processes, the
 field activities on land and water environments (to the exclusion of 
the offshore marine environment), as well as pipeline constructions. In 
particular, they are intended to improve the synchronicity between the 
different ministries so as to homogenize the regulatory framework, to 
facilitate the coordination with the municipalities so as to account for
 the different uses of the land, and to improve the collaboration and 
the cooperation with the local stakeholders so as to achieve social 
acceptability faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The preparation of these 
regulations capitalizes on a series of in-depth reviews undertaken by 
the government of Quebec over the past few years and it reflects a very 
modern view of the industry best practices. The regulations aim at 
facilitating and accelerating the exploration and production of 
hydrocarbons in Quebec while enforcing very high industrial and 
professional standards for the safety of environment, persons and 
properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A period of forty-five 
days is allowed for comments and recommendations from the civil society,
 during which Petrolympic will carefully review the draft regulations 
and provide feed-backs to the government if appropriate. The government 
will then be able to implement the regulations, thus triggering the 
enactment of the Hydrocarbons Law. In parallel, the Ministry of 
Environment of Quebec is pursuing the review and update of its current 
regulation on water protection, a section of which providing 
complementary regulation to <b>oil</b> and natural gas industrial activities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Petrolympic CEO Mendel 
Ekstein commented: "As Petrolympic is moving forward to develop its 
diversified assets in Quebec, it is reassuring to see that we can grow 
and evolve in an environment defined by a set of modern and sensible 
laws and regulations. We are looking forward to collaborate with the 
government to put these regulations in practice in a very near future."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Management is confident 
that developing local hydrocarbon resources is a positive step for the 
Province, as it will balance Quebec's energy portfolio and strengthen 
its economy, while reducing the energy import deficit. Petrolympic is 
fully committed to securing and maintaining the <b>social license</b> and local support for its operations. Petrolympic seeks the orderly and responsible commercial development of its Quebec <b>oil</b> and gas exploration licenses, within the framework of the new Act and the new regulations.</p>

and on parts of <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s Keystone line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Enbridge</span> and <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>
 said the technology will complement, not replace, their existing suite 
of leak detection tools during the multiyear pilot as well as any 
potential expanded use of the sensors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It will require a 
significant investment by any pipeline company to do this, but you have 
to measure that in terms of the incremental benefit," said Ray 
Philipenko, Enbridge's manager of leak detection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're trying to improve 
our already strong safety record, so where is this going to take us? And
 we need to answer those questions. There has to be substantial benefit 
in order to justify cost."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Koles said Hifi's censors
 cost roughly $10 to $15 per metre in a new pipeline project where 
trenches have already been dug, calling the expense a rounding error in 
large projects. There is also an ongoing servicing fee for the company's
 software and technical support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fibre optic cables 
have been installed on a 32-kilometre stretch of Enbridge's Norlite 
project in northern Alberta, and will be tested on either end of <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s Keystone mainline, in Hardisty and in Houston after installation scheduled for next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The scope of this 
project is to take technology that we've tested in the lab ... and put 
it out in the real world and find what are the challenges," said Douglas
 Robertson, who leads a team that tests new leak detection systems for 
TransCanada. "The (company's) commercial group will decide about new 
pipeline construction."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Koles said pipeline 
companies have generally been reluctant to be the first to adopt new 
technologies, opting to wait until the tools or methods are proven 
before joining the bandwagon. Having large players on board for a pilot 
could give the small firm some leverage, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're not well known 
for adopting new innovation," Koles said, adding there are good reasons 
for this "very conservative, very safe" approach. "As a result, it 
becomes a little challenging on trying to sell innovation into something
 like a pipeline company."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hifi's expansion efforts 
are focused on new pipelines and retrofits of existing ones, especially 
in sensitive areas such as river crossings, spots where erosion is a 
concern and locations of previous spills.</p>

<span class="companylink">Inter Pipeline Ltd</span>.’s (IPL-T) stock has “significantly” underperformed this year and is now “attractively” valued, according to <span class="companylink">BMO</span>
 Nesbitt Burns analyst Ben Pham.Blaming the dip on concerns about its 
future growth and increased commodity price exposure alongside “weak” 
second-quarter results, he raised his rating for the Calgary-based 
company to “outperform” from “market perform” in a research note on the 
energy infrastructure industry.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“With
 NGL Processing cash flow poised to rebound in the second half of 2017 
following planned outages in Q2 and supported by higher frac spreads 
over the next year, the recent share price weakness provides for a great
 long-term investment opportunity, in our view,” said Mr. Pham. “Coupled
 with an attractive 24-per-cent upside to our unchanged target price of 
$27 including a 7-per-cent dividend yield (70-per-cent payout), we are 
upgrading our rating.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pham said the 
company’s NGL (natural gas liquids) processing appears set to grow going
 forward, with the acquisition of Williams Canada last year bolstering 
its processing footprint. “OPL is now benefitting from the same positive
 trends driving NGL levered names like KEY [<span class="companylink">Keyera Corp</span>.] and <span class="companylink">PPL</span> [<span class="companylink">Pembina Pipeline Corp</span>.],
 namely due to the increase in liquids-rich drilling and NGL 
production,” he said. “One opportunity is the proposed $3.1-billion PDH +
 PP [[propane dehydrogenation and polypropylene] &nbsp;project, where 
FID is expected H2/17 ($2 per share of potential upside), while another 
is the potential increase in frac spreads that would benefit existing 
operations. The Cochrane facility should also return to strong 
utilization following a planned outage in Q2. The unfortunate 
consequence of the NGL business is the increase in commodity exposure it
 comes with: to 18-per-cent year-to-date 2017 versus 10 per cent in 
2016. While the higher commodity exposure could continue to weigh on 
valuation, we think it will be contained and highly reliable cash flow 
in <b>Oil</b> Sands Pipes should offset. “As NGL processing adds to cash flow in the near term, opportunities related to intra-Alberta <b>oil</b>
 sands projects could arise in the medium term. Last year, IPL announced
 a new TOP contact for the Kirby North project; $125-million is expected
 to be invested at attractive returns. We believe this announcement 
illustrates that IPL still has considerable hidden value in the 
expansion potential of its <b>oil</b> sands/diluent pipelines. About 
$4-billion of potential investment has been identified and is not 
reflected in our model.”Mr. Pham maintained a price target of $27 for 
Inter Pipeline shares. The analyst consensus price target is $29.31, 
according to <span class="companylink">Thomson Reuters</span> data.“IPL 
shares are down 19 per cent versus a 3-per-cent decline for the group on
 a slowdown in dividend growth (we model for 4 per cent in 2018) and 
higher commodity exposure,” he said. “IPL now trades at a discount 
compared to its historical premium: 2018 estimated enterprise 
value/EBITDA has compressed to 12.5 times from 14.0 times since the 
beginning of the year, while the 2018 estimated FCF [free cash flow] 
yield has risen to 9.5 per cent from 8 per cent. We believe the 
company's assets deserve a premium multiple given their long-life nature
 with creditworthy counterparties.”On the industry as a whole, Mr. Pham 
said he's shifting his preference to pipelines over utilities, noting: 
"Following a review of our Energy Infrastructure Top-Down Investment 
Framework, we have shifted our investment preference towards pipeline 
&amp; midstream equities over power &amp; utility within Canadian Energy
 Infrastructure. Why? (1) Midstream has significantly underperformed 
utilities this year and the sector is now trading at an attractive 
9-per-cent FCF yield vs. the historical five-year average of 8%. In 
contrast, utility names are trading at a 7-per-cent FCF yield, which is 
generally in line with its five-year historical average. (2) pipeline 
stocks offer higher dividend growth; and (3) we believe the combination 
of rising bond yields and a range-bound <b>oil</b> price is more positive for pipeline than the utility portion of our infrastructure coverage."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pham also upgraded his rating for <span class="companylink">Keyera Corp</span>.
 (KEY-T) based on its “robust” growth pipeline and “attractive 
valuation.”“Given the downdraft in Canada's midstream sector lately, we 
are becoming more bullish on the stocks generally,” he said. “KEY is 
perhaps a riskier proposition than most due to its gas processing 
throughput risk and Marketing volatility. Having said that, the stock 
has gone nowhere over the last two years and now trades at a modest 
discount to the group vs. a historical premium. We think cash flow per 
share should accelerate next year and the 16-per-cent implied upside to 
our unchanged $42 target is attractive. Accordingly, we are upgrading 
the shares to Outperform from Market Perform.”Mr. Pham admitted he 
recently saw limited upside for Keyera shares due to a number of 
factors, including a drop in gas processing throughput, “heightened” 
counterparty risk, downside in market profit and midstream fee 
compressions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Those risks have mostly 
surfaced now and are more than reflected in the share price, in our 
opinion,” he said. “Marketing delivered $23-million EBITDA in Q2/17 
versus $60-90-million per quarter in 2015, gas processing throughput saw
 5-10-per-cent declines in 2015 and 2016, and frac fees have come under 
pressure due to the infrastructure over-build. As a result, the stock 
has gone nowhere over the last two years, while sector values have 
risen, with most midstream stocks up 15-20 per cent over that similar 
period. “Given that relative performance, the stock is trading at a 
discount on 2018 estimated FCF yield (9.2 per cent versus the 
pipeline/midstream average of 8.8 per cent). Historically, KEY garnered a
 premium to the group due to strong management, a conservative balance 
sheet, and a premium organic growth outlook. Robust Marketing profit 
during 2014-2015 probably also drove valuations higher than they would 
normally go on infrastructure growth alone.”His target remains $42. 
Consensus is $44.27.=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Falco Resources Ltd</span>.’s (FPC-X) Horne 5 
project is “to be advanced to production or be attractive as a potential
 acquisition target given the rarity of large scale, long life, and low 
cost projects in safe jurisdictions,” according to Raymond James analyst
 Tara Hassan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initiating coverage of 
the stock with an “outperform” rating, Ms. Hassan said Horne 5, located 
in Rouyn-Noranda, Que., stands out from its development stage peers 
based on its potential scale in production as well as its low cost 
profile and extended mine life. Falco owns the entire stake in the 
project, previously mined by <span class="companylink">Noranda Mines Ltd</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The project’s proximity 
to a mining centre eliminates many of the challenges that can face a 
development project as Horne 5 is easily accessible, has power and water
 to site, proximity to equipment suppliers, and access to a highly 
skilled labour pool,” the analyst said. “With the project being located 
on a brownfield site and in an active industrial area, permitting risks 
are perceived to be low, particularly given that the bulk of the 
tailings will be placed underground as paste fill or at other past 
producing operations on its claims. We note that Falco will need to add a
 surface tailings facility for the material it does not return 
underground; however, it is in talks to acquire a brownfield site that 
it could expand for its needs. It is also in discussions to acquire 
surface rights in two areas that it will require for surface 
infrastructure. The areas that it is looking to acquire will necessitate
 relocation of a school and an administrative building. We expect these 
discussions to conclude in 4Q17.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added: “The PEA 
outlined average annual production of 236,000 ounces Au at AISC of $427 
(U.S.) per ounce (net of by-products) over a 12 year mine life. This 
pegs Horne 5 in the top 10 Canadian development projects (with a 
published study) on an annual production basis and in the bottom two on a
 cash cost basis. When evaluating development projects not held by a 
major or intermediate producer, Horne 5 ranks in the top 3 Canadian 
development projects on a production basis.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hassan also emphasized the advantages stemming from Falco’s experienced management team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“One of the biggest 
challenges facing many development stage companies is establishing the 
team with the right skillsets and experience to carry the project 
through to production,” she said. “When a project the scale of Horne 5 
is proposed, we view this to be a bigger challenge as there are 
generally limited people available with the relevant experience building
 a project of that scale. In the case of Falco however, we believe it is
 uniquely positioned as it already has this team in place. The 
management team and Board of Directors behind Falco include many of the 
major players involved in designing, permitting, constructing, and 
operating the Canadian Malartic mine, one of Canada’s largest gold 
mines. With relevant recent experience in the region and with a large 
scale, high capital cost project, we believe the Falco team is well 
positioned to advance Horne 5 to production. While building a mine of 
the proposed scale of Horne 5 introduces unique technical complexities, 
the Falco team has encountered many of the same challenges in building 
the Canadian Malartic mine and are thus well positioned to address these
 challenges at Horne 5 and ensure risks remain low during the 
construction and operating phases. The common elements between the 
projects include the financing of a large scale, high capital cost 
project and advancing the project through the permitting process in the 
same jurisdiction. Unlike at Canadian Malartic, however, the Horne 5 
project is situated in a heavily used industrial area and is on a 
brownfield site, which we believe will simplify the permitting and <b>social license</b> components of the project.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hassan set a price target for the stock of $2. The analyst consensus price target is $1.91, according to <span class="companylink">Thomson Reuters</span> data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois expects <span class="companylink">Tesla Inc</span>.
 (TSLA-Q) to post losses until 2020, a year longer than the consensus 
projection on the Street. He believes the company’s vertically 
integrated business model (from manufacturing to distribution and 
supercharging) cannot become profitable as quickly as his peers expect 
or valuation multiples imply. Mr. Houchois initiated coverage of the 
stock with an “underperform” rating and $280 (U.S.) price target, which 
implies 27-per-cent downside from Monday’s close. The average target is 
$333.78. "Given capital intensity, we don't think DCF can justify the 
current valuation, let alone upside," said Mr. Houchois. "We appreciate 
the growth upside from a brand whose reach goes well beyond auto markets
 and that valuing Tesla today assumes some form of 'steady-state' that 
is unlikely to happen anytime soon."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though RBC Dominion Securities analyst Gary Bisbee believes there's "some" value in <span class="companylink">Equifax Inc</span>.
 (EFX-N) for patient, risk-tolerant investors, he said there's no rush 
as financial estimates for the scandal-ridden company need to fall and 
negative news could stem from Congressional hearings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wake of a 
34-per-cent drop in share price following the Sept. 8 disclosure of a 
data breach, Mr. Bisbee said "uncertainty remains high" and pointed to 
three lingering questions for investors: "1) How will the underlying 
earnings power of <span class="companylink">Equifax</span> be impacted 
by the breach?; 2) What risk of market share losses to competitors 
exists as fallout from the breach continues?; 3) Is there risk of 
tightened regulations or new legislation that “changes the rules” for 
the credit bureaus and hurts their profitability or growth prospects?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bisbee reduced his 2018 revenue forecast for <span class="companylink">Equifax</span>
 by 3.1 per cent and his earnings per share expectation by 11 per cent 
(to $5.96 from $6.68). His GAAP EPS estimate fell 37 per cent to $3.55 
from $5.68 including direct breach-related costs and estimated insurance
 recoveries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Clearly we have made 
many assumptions that could prove to be wrong, though we believe that 
they are reasonable under the circumstances and given what we know,” he 
said. “On the negative front, it is possible that providing monitoring 
to consumers could cost far more than our $260-million forecast, 
depending on the number of consumers that sign up or the cost to provide
 the service. And, we have not assumed any regulatory fines or legal 
settlements or judgements, though both are possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“On the positive front, 
insurance coverage could be larger, and we may have been too punitive in
 assuming that there is no cost reduction to partially offset the Global
 Consumer revenue decline (we don’t assume this because the business 
will likely actually be staffing up to provide the free monitoring to 
the much larger number of consumers getting free monitoring). We also 
may be double counting somewhat by assuming no cost takeout in Global 
Consumer while assuming that the monitoring costs (including <span class="companylink">Equifax</span>’s own costs) are fully in the model in the breach-related line.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He maintained an 
“outperform” rating for the stock and dropped his target to $113 (U.S.) 
from $154. The analyst average is $124, according to Bloomberg</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have been conditioned to recommend buying <span class="companylink">Equifax</span>
 on weakness (January-February 2016, October-November 2016), and that 
may well be the right approach here,” the analyst said. “However, there 
remains significant uncertainty into the costs and potential 
repercussions of the breach, and <span class="companylink">Equifax</span>
 will likely suffer in the court of public opinion in the short term. We
 also see little to be excited about in the near-term financial picture,
 as <span class="companylink">Equifax</span> faces USIS deceleration in 
H2/17 as mortgage refinancing volumes fall and it laps the US mortgage 
industry’s adoption of trended data last summer. Estimates need to fall 
(consensus 2018 adjusted EPS is 8 per cent above our new $5.96 
estimate). Add in some ACA uncertainty, tough comps through Q1/18 and 
likely lingering uncertainty about the financial and operational impact 
of the breach, and we see few potential short-term catalysts to drive a 
rebound in the shares, especially heading into what will likely be a 
difficult Congressional hearing on Oct. 3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Despite this challenging
 near-term outlook, we retain our Outperform rating, as we believe that 
current levels offer value for patient, risk-tolerant investors. We 
continue to believe in the quality of the management team and business 
model, and we believe that the franchise will work through this issue 
and continue to be a good (likely above average) compounder over time. 
However, in the short term we see no rush to step in to the stock, and 
prefer other recommended stocks where the risk side of risk-reward is 
more quantifiable.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citing its “attractive” real estate positioning, Credit Suisse analyst Christian Buss raised his rating for <span class="companylink">Gap Inc</span>. (GPS-N) to “neutral” from “underperform.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upgrade stems from 
Mr. Buss’s analysis of real estate for 32 softline vending and retail 
companies. He examined companies across eight “key criteria of retail 
health.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The biggest surprise in our analysis was <span class="companylink">The Gap Inc</span>.'s
 top 10 score,” he said. “GPS scored 57.1 per cent versus the group 
average of 50 per cent, and well above other mall-based specialty retail
 companies (LB [<span class="companylink">L Brands Inc</span>.] 50 per cent, ANF [<span class="companylink">Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co</span>.]
 50 per cent, and KORS [Michael Kors Holding Ltd.] 43.8 per cent). GPS 
pulled ahead by scoring higher in the mall exposure and mall quality 
categories.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Buss also said he was
 “encouraged” by the company’s recent announcement of a decision to 
close 200 low-quality Gap brand and <span class="companylink">Banana Republic</span> locations with the aim to focus on its Old Navy and Athleta chains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We believe the move to a
 healthier fleet and an increased focus on digital is prudent as sales 
continue to shift online,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Buss raised his 
fiscal 2017 comparable same-store sales growth, revenue and earnings per
 share projections to 1.1 per cent, $15.517-billion (U.S.) and $2.06, 
respectively, from 0.9 per cent, $15.512-billion and $2.02. His 2018 
estimates moved to 1.6 per cent $15.912-billion and $2.27 from 0.8 per 
cent, $15.765-billion, and $2.15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His target price for the stock increased to $30 from $23. The analyst average is $26.47.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Believing its merger with <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T Inc</span>. (T-N) is close to receiving regulatory approval, Credit Suisse analyst Omar Sheikh downgraded <span class="companylink">Time Warner Inc</span>. (TWX-N) to “neutral” from “outperform.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In the U.S., we believe 
it would be difficult for the DOJ to block the transaction on antitrust 
grounds given its vertical nature and the precedent from <span class="companylink">Comcast</span>'s
 acquisition of NBCU,” he said. “The main outstanding antitrust barrier 
is in Brazil, where the regulator (CADE) has highlighted competition 
concerns about the merger – however, we note that in the worst case T 
could divest <span class="companylink">Sky</span> Brasil to alleviate these concerns.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sheikh raised his 2017 and 2018 earnings per share projections to $6.09 and $6.63 from $5.95 and $6.62.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said: “We have confidence in <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span>'s
 future earnings growth given (1) as a pure-play content owner, it is 
structurally well-positioned as consumption of video content migrates 
online and new opportunities to monetize content emerge; (2) the 
roll-out of <span class="companylink">HBO</span> NOW should tap new demand for the product and could substantially boost 2020 <span class="companylink">HBO</span>
 EBITDA; (3) Turner screens well on our proprietary genre analysis, and 
we remain bullish on the company's ability to grow affiliate fees over 
the long term.”He maintained a price target of $107.50 (U.S.). Consensus
 is $105.85.“<span class="companylink">Time Warner</span>'s guidance of 
‘high single-digit’ growth in adjusted operating income in 2017 suggests
 the company is still benefiting from strong organic operating trends, 
notably in its core Turner cable networks division where the most recent
 affiliate renewal cycle continues to drive strong revenue growth 
despite softening subscriber trends,” the analyst said. “Absent a merger
 proposal, we argue TWX would likely trade in the 9.3-9.6 times 2018 
enterprise value/EBITDA range today, based on 8.5-9 times for Turner, 11
 times for <span class="companylink">HBO</span> and 9.5 times for <span class="companylink">Warner Bros</span>., suggesting fair value if <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span>
 were to walk away or the deal is blocked of $83-87. If the deal were to
 break, we believe the stock would likely trade above fair value given 
the quality and scarcity value of TWX's assets and their attractiveness 
to other potential merger partners.”</p>

<span class="companylink">Desjardins Group</span> promises a decision this month on whether to turn a brief moratorium on loans to pipeline projects into a permanent boycott.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a precedent-setting 
move from North America's largest credit union, which announced the 
moratorium in July, yet to date, the <b>oil</b> patch and Bay Street have been largely indifferent to Desjardin's debate over the pros and cons of pipes.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary-based
 energy-industry groups initially took shots at Desjardins's decision to
 bow to pressure from environmentalists, but quickly let the issue go 
quiet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In finance circles, 
executives at rival banks were either dismissive – one sarcastically 
asked “When did Desjardins start lending to pipelines?" – or sadly 
realistic, pointing out that the alternative to pipelines is shipping 
crude <b>oil</b> by rail through la belle province, and we learned how badly that can go wrong in Lac-Mégantic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The business community 
ignores the emotionally charged pipeline debate within Desjardins at its
 peril. A decision at the credit union, which speaks for seven million 
members and clients, doesn't dry up cash for energy megaprojects, but it
 would have enormous symbolic value in Quebec, and would likely serve as
 a call to action across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many clients, there's
 a deep relationship to a credit union that's not often found in 
customer ties to a bank or other financial institution. This is 
especially true for many patrons of Desjardins, which has a 117year 
history and branches in a great many villages and towns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the credit union's 
social role is not always well appreciated from outside the province, 
Desjardins speaks for a significant slice of the Quebec population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Desjardins is wrestling 
with a decision on energy transportation that's baffling to most folks 
in financial and engineering circles: This crowd just doesn't get 
opposition to pipelines. Most members of the business community see 
utilities as well-regulated companies filled with clever, if slightly 
boring engineers who move <b>oil</b> and gas with admirable reliability (contrast relatively rare pipeline leaks to how often the cellphone network drops calls).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there's a significant
 portion of the population that draws a straight line from global 
warming and starving polar bears to energy megaprojects. These clients 
have already pushed European banks such as <span class="companylink">ING Group</span>
 into halting loans to pipelines. Environmental and First Nations groups
 are becoming increasingly strident in protest at North American 
financial institutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Utilities build and operate pipelines with a <b>social license</b>,
 an ephemeral but important concept that implies people have to be 
comfortable with the way a company does business if that company is 
going to keep doing business. If Desjardins, its seven million clients 
and 47,000 employees decide the institution is no longer lending to 
pipelines, there's a strong argument that the projects have lost their 
social licence in Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a minimum, a permanent
 Desjardins ban on pipeline lending would be a huge setback for the 
planned $16-billion Energy East pipeline, which passes virtually every 
major population centre in Quebec as it carries crude from Alberta and 
Saskatchewan to three refineries and a marine terminal on the east 
coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s Energy East project 
already faces wellorganized opposition from the likes of 80 mayors in 
the Montreal area and a host of environmental groups. The federal 
Liberals have remained supportive. Approval becomes even more unlikely 
if one of province's largest financial institutions comes out against 
financing pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Desjardins' pipeline 
policy will also guide the thinking at credit unions in jurisdictions 
such as British Columbia, where a newly installed NDP government is 
already catering to its political base by moving to reverse the previous
 regime's decisions on energy projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are better ways for
 a financial institution to help shape Canada's energy future than the 
radical approach under consideration at Desjardins, which would cut off 
funding to a capital-intensive sector that is critical to the country's 
economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long before Desjardins 
announced its moratorium, wellinformed voices in banking were mapping 
out a path to a green future. In a keynote speech last year in Edmonton,
 Royal Bank of Canada CEO Dave McKay put forward a thoughtful case for 
using the wealth generated from fossil fuels to help fund the 
renewableenergy project that can power the economy going forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our ability in the 
decades ahead to finance innovation, to create the technologies that 
will power the 21st century and help transform the world to a cleaner 
economy, depends on our decisions today to get our natural resources to 
market," Mr. McKay said. RBC's CEO noted Canada hasn't built a major 
pipeline since 2010, while the Americans have increased capacity by 17 
per cent in the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actively engaging with 
energy companies and advocating for a future that's less reliant on 
fossil fuels better fits with Desjardins' progressive mandate than 
simply cutting ties with <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> and the rest of utilities, which are among Canada's biggest corporations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A precedent-setting 
boycott would be a bad decision. The move would be largely symbolic – 
the Quebec credit union will never be a major lender to pipelines – yet 
it would signal that a major financial institution is no longer willing 
to do business with the <b>oil</b> patch, a key sector of the economy. 
If executives at Canada's largest financial institutions stop talking to
 leaders in the energy sector, this country is heading in the wrong 
direction.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts and investors 
are hoping for clarity on the fate of the project, which has been thrust
 into question since John Horgan's NDP in British Columbia wrestled 
power from the Liberals with the help of the Greens, who are staunchly 
opposed to the $7.4-billion development.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 company, which has said it stands by the merits of the project, is 
scheduled to report its second-quarter results after markets close 
Wednesday, followed by a conference call with analysts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We expect KML-specific 
topics to be covered to include whether the Trans Mountain expansion 
project is on track for construction to begin in September 2017, as well
 as commentary on the NDP-led government in B.C.," said RBC analyst 
Robert Kwan in a report to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada</span> president Ian 
Anderson has said he is willing to meet with the provincial NDP and 
Greens but won't make further concessions on the project, setting the 
stage for a potential showdown between the energy giant and the 
fledgling government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada</span>
 completed its $1.75-billion initial public offering to raise funds for 
the Trans Mountain expansion in one of the biggest and most 
controversial IPOs in Canada in recent memory. Since then, its stock has
 lost ground from the initial offering of $17 per share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TD Securities analyst 
Linda Ezergailis wrote in a report that clarification on timing of the 
Trans Mountain project will likely boost the company's shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We believe that KML 
shares will re-rate upwards once investor confidence in the timing of 
bringing TMEP into service is bolstered by a clear line of sight to the 
conclusion of provincial political uncertainty and litigation associated
 with <b>social license</b> issues," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Justin 
Trudeau approved the project to twin the Trans Mountain pipeline between
 Edmonton and Burnaby, B.C., last fall and then-B.C. premier Christy 
Clark came to support it in January after five conditions she placed on 
it had been met.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, after Clark lost the election, Horgan has promised to use "every tool" available to stop the expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results from <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada</span> kick off second-quarter earnings in the oilpatch, with news about shipper commitments for <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s Keystone XL pipeline also expected to garner attention when the pipeline company reports its results on July 28.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher Canadian interest rates and uncertainty about where <b>oil</b> prices are headed have made for a cautious mood as major Calgary-based producers roll out their latest earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judith Dwarkin, chief 
economist at RS Energy Group, said higher interest rates generally mean a
 stronger loonie, spelling bad news for <b>oil</b> companies who pay most of their costs in Canadian dollars and sell most of their products in U.S. currency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At the same time, <b>oil</b> prices are starting to move up so that to some extent may help to offset the impact of the higher dollar."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CIBC analyst Arthur Grayfer said in a note Monday that results from <b>oil</b> and gas companies that also own refineries will be aided by better refining profit margins in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said many major <b>oil</b>
 and gas producers in Western Canada had planned and unplanned 
maintenance shutdowns in the second quarter which could result in lower 
production and higher costs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Cenovus Energy Inc</span>. (CVE-T, CVE-N) finds itself in a “particularly precarious position,” according to <span class="companylink">Desjardins Securities</span> analyst Justin Bouchard.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bouchard said a “depleted margin of safety” has increased the risk surrounding the Calgary-based integrated <b>oil</b> company, amplified by $43 (U.S.) per barrel WTI.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the analyst 
believes Tuesday’s investor day in Toronto did provide “incremental 
clarity” on its strategy moving forward, including the announcement that
 Brian Ferguson is poised to retire as chief executive officer and 
director at the end of October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“CVE refreshed its 
strategy, including an updated disposition target of $4–5-billion (which
 has been expanded to include Palliser and Weyburn) by year-end, the 
deferral of additional <b>oil</b> sands projects until it has sufficiently delevered, additions to its <b>oil</b>
 sands growth portfolio through land acquisitions and technology 
improvements,” said Mr. Bouchard. “It also noted the potential for 
medium-term infrastructure constraints as it works to execute its Deep 
Basin growth plan.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Mr. Bouchard referred to numerous headwinds faced by Cenovus, which he said put it “between a rock and a hard place.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The confluence of elevated net debt levels, low <b>oil</b>
 and gas prices, limited financial liquidity ($5.3-billion of debt 
maturing by year-end 2019), substantial increase in shares outstanding 
and impending divestment of CVE shares by <span class="companylink">ConocoPhillips</span>
 (adding technical pressure on the stock price), loss of market 
confidence in the story and attempt to execute a substantial divestment 
strategy in a buyer’s market (which increases the risk of fetching an 
underwhelming price for the assets) all contribute to the negative 
sentiment,” he said. “In our view, the only way out of this tailspin 
begins with the successful execution of its divestment strategy, 
followed closely by a rebound in commodity prices (to $55 U.S. per 
barrel plus WTI), which would in turn solve the company’s liquidity 
concerns. However, even then, we believe market confidence would only 
return following an extended period of successful execution of its Deep 
Basin strategy—which probably will not occur until after 2018 (at the 
earliest). Meanwhile, looking at the downside risks in the section that 
follows, we believe Cenovus is out of ‘easy levers’ to pull in the event
 that <b>oil</b> prices remain low for longer.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accordingly, Mr. Bouchard
 dropped his target price for Cenovus shares to $14 from $20 with an 
unchanged “buy” rating. The analyst consensus price target is $16.94, 
according to Bloomberg data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“From our perspective, 
the core of Cenovus — the FCCL and Narrows Lake assets — remains highly 
attractive owing to its best-in-class <b>oil</b> sands acreage, 
long-life and low-decline production base, and opportunities for further
 expansion at attractive capital efficiencies,” he said. “From a 
fundamental perspective, the stock is trading well below its intrinsic 
value (in our view), but that’s not the market focus right now. Instead,
 the market’s attention is set squarely on the fact that the company has
 depleted its margin of safety and muddied the waters through its 
purchase of the <span class="companylink">Conoco</span> Deep Basin 
assets. That, in turn, has greatly increased the number of headwinds and
 has dramatically amplified the risks surrounding the story — including 
elevated debt levels, reduced liquidity, its execution of a divestment 
strategy in a buyer’s market, questions surrounding its ability to 
deliver on the Deep Basin assets, the significant increase in shares 
outstanding and the loss of market confidence — each of which is 
magnified given the current commodity environment ($45 U.S. per barrel 
WTI) and simply cannot be ignored. As a result, while we are maintaining
 our Buy rating, we are cutting our target price.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, while acknowledging risks remain for investors due to the recent share price decline, <span class="companylink">Peters &amp; Co</span>. analyst Tyler Reardon said the current valuation is “attractive enough now to warrant buying the stock.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He upgraded Cenovus to “sector outperform” from “sector perform.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With the recent weak 
performance in Cenovus' stock price, it is becoming more evident that 
many of the challenges the company faces are reflected in the share 
price," the firm said. "We believe that the asset sales as outlined by 
the company will be completed with the anticipated proceeds sufficient 
to cover the bridge loan ($3.5-billion). Even with these dispositions, 
debt levels remain high as netbacks are very low at <b>oil</b> prices. 
The question of whether to buy the stock at this level really comes down
 to three things: (1) does it have sufficient longevity to allow an 
investor time for a commodity price recovery; (2) are the assets of high
 enough quality to matter in a $45 U.S. per barrel to $55/B pricing 
environment; and (3) is the potential upside in the share price 
attractive enough at this point to compensate for the downside risk. 
With asset sales to be completed in the coming months, this should allow
 the company time to withstand lower <b>oil</b> prices. Although the 
various metrics look challenged at strip prices and the equity is very 
sensitive to lower commodity prices, we believe that its assets are 
generally high quality and will compete with most other North American 
developments in this pricing range."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Reardon lowered his target to $13 from $14.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canaccord Genuity analyst Dennis Fong upgraded the company to "buy" from "hold" with a $15 target (unchanged).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the flip side, 
Macquarie analyst Brian Bagnell downgraded Cenovus to "underperform" 
from "neutral" with a $8 target (from $15).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TD Securities analyst Menno Hulshof said Cenovus’ road is “now defined, but appears long and winding.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He lowered his target to $15.50 from $18.50 with a “buy” rating (unchanged).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Although the role of the
 Deep Basin in its five-year strategic plan was well-articulated, its 
extended balance sheet remains front-and-center,” the analyst said. “To 
this end, CVE has increased its year-end divestiture target to 
$4-billion-$5-billion from $3.6-billion. Assets added to the list (i.e.,
 in addition to Pelican Lake and Suffield) include Weyburn and Palliser 
Block. It also flagged the potential for the sale of Deep Basin GORRs, <b>oil</b> sands GORRs, undeveloped <b>oil</b> sands leases, and infrastructure. However, with WTI <b>oil</b>
 prices continuing to slide (now $44 U.S. per barrel), it is unlikely 
that the market will give CVE the benefit of the doubt until it can get 
some of these transactions across the line. Selling Pelican Lake and 
Suffield in Q3 (per guidance) at reasonable metrics would be a step in 
the right direction, in our view.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CIBC World Markets analyst Arthur Grayger dropped his target to $13 from $18 with a "neutral" rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Cenovus' 2017 Investor 
Day covered a range of topics: including an update on expected 
disposition proceeds, capital allocation expectations once the balance 
sheet is in better shape, various sustainable improvements to the cost 
structure of the <b>oil</b> sands business and growth plans, commentary 
on the latest technological innovations, and a deep dive on the Deep 
Basin assets," he said. "Unfortunately, the market remains acutely 
focused on the near-term priorities for the company such as debt 
repayment and now management uncertainty, which overshadowed the key 
takeaways from the Investor Day presentation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial Alliance Securities analyst Dylan Steuart upgraded his rating for <span class="companylink">Home Capital Group Inc</span>.
 (HCG-T) in reaction to its agreement to sell a portfolio of commercial 
mortgage assets valued at approximately $1.2-billion to <span class="companylink">KingSett Capital</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The agreement is 
positive for two reasons,” he said. “First, the $1.16-billion of 
expected proceeds will enable HCG to pay down a significant portion of 
the $1.65-billion of outstanding balance on the 10-per-cent[<span class="companylink">Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan</span>]
 credit line. Second, the proceeds are estimated at 97 per cent of the 
total principal value ($1.2-billion). The estimated impact on earnings 
of $15-million from the divestiture is fairly modest given the very 
recent distressed situation at the firm.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Steuart said the 
troubled company’s liquidity situation is “stabilizing,” adding: “While 
earnings power remains negatively impacted by recent events, the funding
 situation has improved. Current liquidity of $1.14-billion has 
stabilized over the past month, with indications that asset run-off has 
been in line with the deposit outflow.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The biggest outstanding 
question is, what is the earnings power of the operations on an ongoing 
basis? At this stage, there are likely too many unknowns to get a solid 
handle on that question, but two things we know for sure: 1) the asset 
base is shrinking, and 2) margins are likely narrowing. Net interest 
margin as of Q1/17 was 2.44 per cent, up 6 basis points year over year, 
but marked a period of time not impacted by recent turmoil. This asset 
sale of high yield commercial mortgages (yielding 5.76 per cent as of 
Q1/17) will put downward pressure on margins. We estimate a 10 basis 
points negative impact to asset yields from this transaction in a 
vacuum. Recent increases in GIC rates (Oaken rates are up ~75 bps since 
the crisis began) are expected to be somewhat offset by increases in 
non-prime mortgage rates, but we still expect some compression in net 
interest margins. Combine narrowing margins with a shrinking loan book, 
and it is clear that the earnings power of the franchise has been 
negatively impacted over the medium term. We calculated core EPS of 
$1.03 in Q1/17 ($4.11 on an annualized basis). Stressing run-rate 
earnings assuming a shrinking balance sheet and narrowing margin 
indicate that the earnings impact of recent events is meaningful.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Steuart said HCG’s 
outlook has “brightened considerably” since his the latest update to his
 financial model for the company following the release of its 
first-quarter results on May 11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We assume a much slower 
reduction of the uninsured loan portfolio and more favourable terms on 
the line of credit starting in Q3/17,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He raised his full-year 
operating earnings per share projection to 75 cents from 42 cents, while
 his 2018 expectation is now 67 cents, rising from a 95-cent loss. He 
now projects HCG will have a tangible book value per share at $24.08 at 
the end of 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bumping his rating to 
“speculative buy” from “hold,” Mr. Steuart increased his target price 
for HCG shares to $19 from $10.50. Consensus is 14.07.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Raymond James analyst Brenna Phelan also hiked her target price for its shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Recently, <span class="companylink">Home Capital</span>
 has faced a number of negative events, culminating in a crisis of 
confidence whereby it lost $2.5-billion of deposit funding and saw its 
share price decline to close at a low of $5.85 per share,” she said. “We
 view recent developments, specifically settlement with the OSC for 
$30-million, mostly stabilizing (although still costly) deposit funding,
 a reconstituted Board of Directors, and a stated intent to focus on its
 core business as increasingly both encouraging and reflective of a more
 certain operating future for its non-prime mortgage lending business. 
Our estimates, which had previously assumed non-core asset dispositions 
at a discount of 5 per cent in 2Q, are revised to reflect the more 
favorable terms of this $1.2-billion portfolio sale. Overall, the price 
(see below) and the liquidity this sale provides, coupled with more 
stable funding, still-strong demand for non-prime loans and the removal 
of overhang from the OSC suits serve to brighten our outlook 
meaningfully.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the transaction, Ms.
 Phelan’s adjusted earnings per share projection for fiscal 2017 jumped 
to 43 cents from a loss of $1.18. Her 2018 estimate is now $2, up from 
43 cents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With an unchanged “market perform” rating, her target jumped to $17.50 from $10.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While we continue to 
believe a discount to book value is appropriate as current funding costs
 remain too costly to allow for profitable portfolio growth, we are 
increasing our multiple to reflect solid recent progress and much 
greater visibility,” she said. “We note that $17.50 equates to 9.0 times
 our 2018 EPS estimate, to which there may be upside if funding costs 
improve.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial Alliance Securities analyst Elias Foscolos called <span class="companylink">Enerflex Ltd</span>.'s (EFX-T) $140-million deal for Mesa Compression LLC a "beachhead" acquisition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the deal, announced
 Monday night, the analyst expects EFX’s total compression fleet to 
almost 600,000 horsepower, while expanding its geographic footprint 
south of the border. He projects the deal to be immediately accretive to
 earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We believe that EFX has 
been looking to grow both its compression rental and After Market 
Service ) business in the U.S. for many years,” said Mr. Foscolos. “The 
U.S. is the world’s largest gas producer, and to us it makes sense that 
EFX has made this acquisition to establish a ‘beachhead’ position in the
 United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“One key challenge that 
EFX has faced in growing its U.S. rental business has been that beyond 
E&amp;P companies owning compression assets, the U.S. market has a 
substantial amount of Master Limited Partnerships that dominate the 
compression rental space. These MLPs are similar to the old Corporate 
Income Trusts in Canada, in that they eliminated a layer of taxation. We
 speculate that EFX’s ability to quickly close the transaction with cash
 and credit facilities will be a strong selling feature for vendors. We 
view the Mesa acquisition as a ‘mini-AXIP’ transaction. In mid-2014, EFX
 made a transformative acquisition by acquiring the international 
compression assets of AXIP International for $430-million U.S., which 
included 285,000 <span class="companylink">HP</span> of compression (448
 units) in addition to some gas processing facilities. Over time, the 
Company was able to organically grow its compression fleet using the 
AXIP acquisition as a toe-hold and improve its <span class="companylink">AMS</span> revenue. As in the AXIP acquisition, we believe value will ultimately come from cross-selling opportunities.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keeping his “strong buy” rating for the stock, Mr. Foscolos bumped his target to $23.50 from $23. Consensus is $24.39.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While we believe the 
acquisition will be accretive to EBITDA over time, the impact at this 
point is not material enough in nature to move the needle on a multiple 
basis as we are basing our multiple based target valuation on the 
12-month period ending June 30, 2018, and we believe cross-selling 
opportunities in the short term may be limited,” he said. “We do see a 
longer-term benefit and as a result our DCF [discounted cash flow 
valuation has increased to $20.25 (previously $19.75).”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raymond James analyst 
Andrew Bradford bumped his target for Enerflex shares to $22 from 
$21.50.Mr. Bradford said: “We believe that Enerflex’s acquisition of 
Mesa Compression LLC represents attractive value for investors, 
especially given the stability of its cash flow. Mesa’s market focus is 
different than EFX’s traditional mid-stream orientation, which makes it 
difficult for us to comment on the acquisition’s strategic value with 
any confidence. That said, our expectation is that EFX will have little 
trouble growing Mesa’s core business, and perhaps will broaden the 
service offering to larger-scale mid-stream contract compression 
services as well. We continue to rate Enerflex Outperform."CIBC World 
Markets' Jon Morrison raised his target by 50 cents to $25 with an 
"outperformer" rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Morrison said: "We 
view the Mesa acquisition as a solid transaction that is on point with 
Enerflex's long-term corporate strategy and is being completed at what 
we consider as an attractive and logical purchase price. In addition, 
the assets are adjacent to three of the most active unconventional plays
 in the Lower 48, which positions the company to be able to: 1) realize a
 long tail of operating and financial contribution from the acquired 
fleet, which matches the long-life nature of the assets; and, 2) further
 expand Enerflex's presence in the U.S. contract compression business, 
which has been a long-term goal for the company."</p>

<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd</span>. (KML -T) 
possesses an “unprecedented transformational secured growth outlook” due
 to the Trans Mountain Expansion Pipeline, according to TD Securities 
analyst Linda Ezergailis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She initiated coverage of the energy infrastructure company with an “action list buy” rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We like KML based on our
 view of its: 1) substantial asymmetric upside, 2) unprecedented secured
 growth profile, 3) unique asset positioning, 4) base business midstream
 pure play, 5) stable low-risk cash flows, 6) scale and experience, 7) 
aligned sponsor, and 8) no plans to raise common equity,” said Ms. 
Ezergailis. “We see significant benefit in taking a position in advance 
of TMEP construction commencing (target date is September 2017). We 
believe KML shares will re-rate upwards, once investor confidence in the
 timing of bringing TMEP into service is bolstered by a clear line of 
sight to the conclusion of provincial political uncertainty and 
litigation associated with <b>social license</b> issues.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ezergailis set a price target of $26 for the stock. Consensus is $22.67.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citing its current valuation and a lack of a “meaningful” catalyst, Citi analyst Kate McShane downgraded <span class="companylink">Target Corp</span>.
 (TGT-N) to “neutral” from “buy.”“TGT was already under pressure given 
the soft [bricks and mortar] traffic trends, volatile guidance, and 
intensifying competition,” she said. “Plus, Signature, TGT’s key 
differentiator, has been decelerating (we estimated flat in Q1 versus 
low-single digit growth in previous quarters). With [<span class="companylink">Wal Mart Stores Inc</span>., WMT] enhancing its e-comm portfolio with <span class="companylink">Jet.com</span>
 and Bonobos over the past year through acquisitions that target 
millennials and AMZN’s sizable entry into fresh/organic food with <span class="companylink">Whole Foods Market</span>
 acquisition, TGT’s two main competitors have very quickly changed the 
game. This makes TGT’s revenue growth prospects through organic or 
acqusition growth tougher to achieve, absent any kind of game changing 
move.”Ms. McShane also believes <span class="companylink">Target</span>’s
 “big” catalysts have already been realized, adding: “CEO Brian Cornell 
(who started Aug 2014) has already improved the profile of the business 
significantly over the past couple years through: 1) Closing the 
underperforming Canadian TGT segment (Jan. 2015), 2) Selling the 
underperforming pharmacy business to CVS (June 2015), 3) Cutting costs 
by $2.0-billion, and 4) Improving capital allocation with greater-than 
$7.0-billion in share buybacks and the annual dividend per share payout 
grew greater-than 24 per cent.”The analyst lowered her target price for <span class="companylink">Target</span>
 shares to $56 (U.S.) from $63 “on flattish growth ahead combined with 
higher assumptions for capex.” Consensus is currently $59.59.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Though TGT’s 3-year 
multiple average is slightly above 14 times, we think the implied 
14-times multiple is still fairly pricey given the declining comp trends
 driven in part by decelerating Signature comps,” she said. “Plus, TGT’s
 prospects of reaccelerating comps are more uncertain compared with 
prior years as their closest competitors are aggressively increasing 
omnichannel capabilities through acquisitions (AMZN/WFM, 
WMT/Jet.com).“TGT has a challenging road ahead with likely need for 
greater investment spend which could put more down pressure on the 
stock. We could see potential upside if TGT benefits in the short term 
from dept. store (and others) door closures and better inventory 
management, but we think upside is limited given long term secular 
concerns.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis believes <span class="companylink">Adobe Systems Inc</span>. (ADBE-Q) is “doing just what exceptional companies do – execute consistently and well.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the San 
Jose-based software company second-quarter 2017 financial results that 
Mr. Davis deemed “solid across the board.” It reported total revenue for
 the period of $1.772-billion (U.S.), ahead of the analyst’s expectation
 by $42-million and a 27-per-cent increase year over year. It achieved 
operating margins, earnings per share and operating cash flow of 37.2 
per cent, $1.02, and $645-million, ahead of the analyst’s estimates by 
190 basis points, 8 cents, and $280-million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We believe <span class="companylink">Adobe</span>,
 through skillful acquisitions and on point development, has perhaps the
 widest competitive moat of any software firm we know,” said Mr. Davis. 
“We are not saying <span class="companylink">Adobe</span> has no 
competition, but the competitive set is simply not as intensely or 
directly overlapping as what other software firms face. When you combine
 a very compelling business with an investor expectations setting 
machine that literally is second to none, you get exactly what we have 
seen from ADBE shares: pretty consistent, better-than-market 
appreciation. Therefore, guess what, <span class="companylink">Adobe</span>
 did it again with another strong quarter, even adjusting for a bit of 
sandbagging guidance we got off of the last print; even so, the 
algorithms will rejoice and the longs might react favorably, both of 
which should propel ADBE shares higher. We call <span class="companylink">Adobe</span>
 one of our secular BUY ‘compounding’ stocks, which means that investors
 should rationally expect ADBE shares to roughly double within a 
five-year window.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the results, <span class="companylink">Adobe</span>
 also released third-quarter revenue guidance of $1.815-billion, beating
 Mr. Davis’s expectation by $22.5-million. Non-GAAP EPS is projected to 
be $1, which is four cents ahead of the analyst’s projection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In reaction to the results and guidance, Mr. Davis increased his target for <span class="companylink">Adobe</span> shares to $165 (U.S.) from $145. Consensus is $146.54.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He maintained a “buy” rating for the stock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, RBC Dominion 
Securities analyst Ross MacMillan also raised his financial projections 
for the company, but he did not touch his $157 target or “outperform” 
rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“ADBE continues to 
deliver on the promise of better operating leverage and a longer tail to
 the model transition, but still has pricing and capital allocation 
muscles to flex,” said Mr. MacMillan. “We continue to see a strong 
earnings/ cash flow compounding story.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Exchange Income Corp</span>. (EIF-T) is 
“designed to deliver safe dividend growth,” said Cormark Securities 
analyst David Tyerman.He initiated coverage of the Winnipeg-based 
company, which is focused on opportunities in aerospace and aviation 
services and equipment, and manufacturing, with a “buy” rating.“EIC has 
increased its dividend 12 times since its first dividend in June 2004, 
raising the dividend at a 5.8-per-cent annual rate (106 per cent total) 
to the current 17.5 cents per month rate (7.2-per-cent annual yield) and
 without a single decrease,” said Mr. Tyerman. “EIC has achieved this by
 building a diversified business portfolio focused on aviation, 
aerospace and manufacturing assets. Growth is driven through acquisition
 and organic sources. The Company focuses on businesses with low 
volatility and low cross-correlation. EIC also seeks to protect and grow
 the dividend by maintaining prudent financial leverage and payout 
ratios.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tyerman believes 
additional growth is “baked in,” expecting to see returns on recent 
“large organic invested capital deployment.”The analyst set a price 
target of $40 for the stock. Consensus is $44.70.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We recommend investors 
buyEIC shares to benefit from EIC’s attractive dividend yield and EPS 
and dividend growth potential,” he said. “EIC’s $2.10 annualized 
dividend (paid monthly) yields 7.2 per cent at the Company’s current 
share price. We estimate EIC will increase its dividend by an average of
 6.4 per cent per year and its EPS by 7.1 per cent per year from 2016 to
 2019. We also think the stock is undervalued. We believe the 
combination of good EPS growth, a moderate valuation multiple bump and 
solid and growing dividends should generate an attractive 44.6-per-cent 
investment return over the next year. We expect continued good 
investment upside beyond the next year from the same factors.”=====</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"CWH is the largest

"We believe CWH stands to grow earnings and EBITDA at a better rate than

to improve its long-term earnings growth, which has averaged only 1 per 
cent per year since its 2011 spin from <span class="companylink">ITT</span>
 [Corp.]," said Mr. Graham. "Legacy sales should increasingly benefit 
from better verticals, secular trends, its 35-40-per-cent 
replacement/recurring business, emerging market growth and new 
go-to-market plans. We expect cost-down programs to drive margin 
expansion. Newly acquired Sensus has similar growth dynamics, and should
 be accretive to sales and earnings growth. We see mid-teens earnings 
growth in ‘17-18 with potential upside. We expect XYL to outperform from
 this growth and modest relative multiple expansion."</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Very
 real concerns surface when the topic of the Kinder Morgan Trans 
Mountain pipeline expansion project comes up in conversation. The recent
 alliance formed in BC between the Green and NDP parties led to this 
explicit statement that they will: "immediately employ every tool 
available to the new government to stop the expansion of the Kinder 
Morgan pipeline, the seven-fold increase in tanker traffic on our coast,
 and the transportation of raw bitumen through our province."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Alberta is 
constitutionally entitled to the free and fair transport of our products
 throughout Canada. This is a fundamental part of being part of the 
confederation. Interprovincial pipelines are a federal responsibility 
and this project has the approval of the federal cabinet as well as the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>.
 As it stands now, BC can make it very difficult for the projects to go 
ahead and their decisions will have far reaching consequences for 
Albertans, and indeed for the whole country.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is unfortunate that our government believes they have the "<b>social license</b>"
 needed to get the pipelines approved because they imposed the crippling
 carbon tax on Albertans. This is political posturing intended to make 
Albertans think that the government somehow embodies the will of 
Canadians to move the project forward. Rex Murphy1 in the National Post 
called this idea: "a vapour of pure political duplicity" and Wildrose 
calls it: "political snake <b>oil</b>."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our economy is in 
shambles with 100,000 unemployed Albertans, 84,000 fulltime jobs lost 
last year, and international companies that have left the province. 
Instead of congratulating themselves on their <b>social license</b>, our government should be upholding our constitutional rights, the decisions of the NEB with respect to transporting our <b>oil</b>, championing our <b>oil</b>
 industry, and establishing strong working relationships with First 
Nations and stakeholders to ensure that there is confidence about the 
ability to move <b>oil</b> across the provinces to tidewater in an environmentally safe way for the benefit of all Canadians.</p>

 license is a permit from an authority to own or use something, do a 
particular thing, or carry on a trade or action. A license comes with 
restrictions and limitations that are typically limited by 
jurisdictional boundaries. As an example, if you were to hold a license 
that permits the holder to carry a firearm in Canada, that license 
possibly would not be recognized and you would not be permitted to carry
 a firearm in other countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the guise of what 
is turning out to be a fictitious form of licensed permission, the 
Alberta government introduced Bill 20, the Climate Leadership 
Implementation Act on May 24th, 2016. The Act was sold to Albertans by 
making claims that it would allow us implied permission to build the 
pipelines required to get our natural resources to market. One year 
later this claim is turning out to not be worth the paper it was written
 on.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 Alberta government's Climate Leadership Plan, which average Albertans 
know now as the Carbon Tax, has had a financial effect on virtually 
every single purchase we make. Besides the obvious direct cost on 
everyday consumer items, the plan has had an adverse effect on Alberta's
 energy sector which is obviously not in the provinces best interests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <b>social license</b>
 claims that accompanied the passage of the Alberta government's plan 
has apparently not been accepted by their British Columbian brethren, 
who have teamed up with the BC Green Party, who "are determined to 
immediately employ every tool available to the new government and stop 
the expansion of the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> 
pipeline" from being built. What we have learned is that licensing 
agreements that are expected to cross jurisdictional lines must have 
universal approval by the government, where the license is attempting to
 be used; something this Alberta government obviously did not do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To say the <b>social license</b>
 myth being sold to us by our Alberta government has been a failure is 
an understatement. MLA for Chestermere Rockyview, Leela Aheer delivered 
an impassioned Member's Statement that captured what the government's <b>social license</b> has amounted to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For two years this government has been imposing ideological tax hikes and caps on our <b>oil</b> sands, all in the name of <b>social license</b>.
 The Premier conned Albertans, undermined the authority and integrity of
 our national energy regulators to excuse her long-held radical 
environmental agenda." -Leela Aheer The Alberta government have created 
an unspoken pact with the LEAP Manifesto and environmental radicals like
 Tzeporah Berman, who after the BC NDP and Green Party announced their 
coalition government, celebrated on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>
 by saying "this a turning point for BC." This is hardly a productive 
attitude coming from a member of the Alberta Oilsands advisory group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It appears that <b>social license</b> is nothing more than the snake <b>oil</b> its perceived benefits are turning out to be. The cost to Albertans for this snake <b>oil</b>
 is real and it can be measured in financial, job, and investment 
losses. It would serve the Premier and the Alberta government well to 
stop working for the environmental radicals, quit perpetuating the myth 
of <b>social license</b>, and start working for Albertans.</p>

PHILIPPE COUILLARD (Quebec Premier): We are all Quebecers, and therefore
 we can all say in French and in English, (speaking in French). Being a 
Quebecer is our way of being Canadians.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON:
 It's back. That's right. The most divisive debate in the country, the 
one that almost tore Canada apart has been shockingly re-opened by 
Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard. He argues that Canada's 150th 
birthday is the perfect time to crack open the Constitution and make 
Quebec a distinct society. Well the scrum is back to tackle that one. 
Stephanie Levitz is back. Joyce Napier is back. Craig Oliver is back. 
And we now bring our special guests, filmmaker Avi Lewis, who is the 
strategic director of the LEAP, which called for an end to, among other 
things, more development of the oilsands. Thanks for being, Avi, and 
joining the scrum. I'm going to start with you. We all remember these 
debates about the Constitution, the distinct society, Mulroney, boy, why
 do you think Philippe Couillard is doing this now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AVI LEWIS (Strategic 
Director of the LEAP): I think he's feeling pressure from the 
sovereigntist left. I think, I think he's got Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois 
fear. He's seeing, we've seen the PQ abandon being a left-wing party, 
essentially, and become a neo Liberal austerity party, and we're seeing 
the rise of the Quebec Solidaire, and all of a sudden Couillard realizes
 that young people in Quebec are galvanized, not necessarily by 
sovereignty, but by a progressive agenda, which is represented in his 
province now by a sovereignist party. So, I think we may be seeing a 
reconfiguration of the landscape. It took them a while to get the whole 
issue that there might be a little problem between Quebec and the rest 
of the Canada. So now he's trying to make up some ground locally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Well, Craig, here we go again. What do you think about it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CRAIG OLIVER (<span class="companylink">CTV</span> News): I've spent years of my life...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: ...on an 
intellectual forced march, chasing around constitutional talks, and I'll
 tell you one thing about them - whatever nobility they may start in, 
they end in mud. And what Couillard is doing is being a political powder
 monkey. That's what they call the guy on a construction crew in charge 
of dynamite who blows things up. He's going to blow up every, this whole
 issue. Everybody will want to get into it. There will be endless fights
 and squabbles and it could end with defeated governments. It could end 
with the country up for grabs again, as we've seen in the past. This 
could be a mess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: All right. If it is a, political expediency, Joyce, as, as Avi argues, is he playing with dynamite, as Craig says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JOYCE NAPIER (<span class="companylink">CTV</span>
 News): Absolutely, and I think, yeah, totally, that's a great imagine. 
First of all, it's so 1990s, you know, let me get with the program. That
 was a long time ago. Those of us who had the pleasure of covering those
 debates know these long debates about commas, or semicolons. It's just 
doesn't work. It's 1990s. Let's bring back shoulder pads and, why not, 
Farrah Fawcett hair. I don't know. Why is he digging this out? It could 
blow up in his face, because if indeed Avi is right, and he wants to 
counter this, this sort of rising conservativism, or progressive wave in
 Quebec, it may also turn against him, right? The rest of the country 
doesn't want it. And you don't just open a little bit of a 
constitutional debate. We all know it. It's going to open it big and 
wide and then we're going to put everything in there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: ...you can't get control...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAPIER: Equalization, and
 so on, and so forth. I mean, it's not only that. So what is he looking 
for? I don't know. I've been scratching my head. I can't figure it out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Well, it's a 
time of, there's big things going on. There's big trade negotiations. 
I'm sure the federal government is not happy. Justin Trudeau immediately
 said, we are not interested in this. He was unequivocal. Is this the 
kind of thing that once you open it, the separatists love it, you know, 
this thing starts and it's uncontrollable?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STEPHANIE LEVITZ (The <span class="companylink">Canadian Press</span>):
 And Joyce, talked about how it's so 1990s, but I think it's so 2017. I 
mean, here we are in this populist revolt scenario around the world 
while all sorts of voter populations are looking at challenging the 
status quo, and I think to Avi's point...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAPIER: ...(inaudible) the Constitution?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEVITZ: ...there are 
people that are, there are people that are hungry for change. There are 
people that are hungry for making things different. And if there is a 
sense, whether it's economic, whether it's social, whether it's 
religious, whatever, that the elites, that people aren't speaking for 
them. That's where you get these populist uprisings, right?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: I would understand that, but it's Couillard himself that's opened it, right?</p>

mean, I covered the, I covered the referendum for Much Music in '95. We 
had a, we had a show planned for fifteen minutes, and we were on the air
 for five hours. I've got my own scars. But, but look, Quebec never 
signed the darn thing. It is an open wound in the country. Don't just 
dismiss it because you're bored of it. Don't say because there are 
semicolons, we have to shy away from it. There's lots of things that 
could be fixed in that Constitution. I think if you start talking to 
Indigenous communities across this country...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: How, how can they...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEWIS: I think you start talking to other people, there's lots of appetite to have a better Constitution for Canada.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEWIS: And I'm not bored of it. I'm not bored. Craig, you may be bored.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: And they never 
opted out, so how can they opt in? They've got three seats on the 
Supreme Court. The own a quarter of the, the senate. The idea that they 
somehow have opted out, and they want back in, it just doesn't work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: This, okay, I 
would say, it is fair to say that a constitutional wound is not fixed. I
 guess the question is for Philippe Couillard, why try to do it now? 
Timing matters in politics, and speaking of timing, at one point, Justin
 Trudeau had timing on his hand. He had an NDP government in Alberta 
that said, okay, we'll put a cap on oilsands emissions. We'll buy into 
your price on carbon. Give us the Trans Mountain, the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 pipeline from Alberta to Burnaby, BC. He had a Liberal government in BC
 that said, okay, you know, we'll, we'll do that. Now with the results 
in BC, which could be an NDP-Green government. Avi Lewis, is <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> dead?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEWIS: Yeah. Yeah, I 
think it effectively is. It might well have been otherwise. There's 
something called an extraordinary coalition of First Nations, that is 
already in the way, the treaty alliance to, to stop the pipelines. There
 were going to be court challenges. There were challenges from cities 
in, in British Columbia. It was never the sure thing that Notley and 
Trudeau wanted to present it as. But I think Christy Clark might have 
lost this election on <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>. 
Sixty percent of the province voted for parties who were very clear on 
the position. And I think it's revealed, what I'm really excited about 
in this moment is just that we can refocus the debate on the principles 
and the facts and the benefits to people in different parts of this 
land, instead of having politicians blaming, this sort of caricature of 
environmentalists for being against pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Yeah, here's what I don't understand...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEWIS: It's the people of British Columbia that are against it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Rachel Notley's 
an NDP premier. "Mark my words," she says, Stephanie. "That pipeline 
will be built." So now you've got an NDP premier in Alberta telling a 
potential NDP premier in British Columbia, like, showdown. My political 
life depends on your decision. How does that play out?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEVITZ: I mean, I think 
it's so fascinating because, you know, premier, the prime minister has 
staked so much on this concept of <b>social license</b>, right, of 
convincing people to come onside, and his whole argument that 
environmental benefits require economic benefits and all of these things
 and now he's looking down, and how much political capital is Justin 
Trudeau going to want to spend on this thing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Joyce?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAPIER: He was asked 
clearly in Rome, and you know, he's usually on talking points. It's hard
 sometimes to get a real answer from the prime minister, or even his 
cabinet. And I asked him that question, specifically, are you willing to
 go against their will? Talking obviously about the NDP-Green coalition,
 and his answer was crystal clear, it was "yes". Those were fighting 
words coming from the prime minister of Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: Let's remember 
that an awful lot of the people who voted for him as a Liberal in 
British Columbia voted NDP in the election. They are strong 
environmentalists. Trudeau has a lot to lose here. But he's stuck now. 
He's got to not just fight for this pipeline. He's got to endorse this 
pipeline, because he and the pipeline, their fates are entwined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: And so, and Rachel Notley's fate may be entwined, as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAPIER: Yeah, but we're 
assuming, but we're assuming this vote was just against pipelines. Maybe
 it was just against, they, they wanted change. Maybe the voters there 
wanted change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: You may be right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEWIS: I think, I think 
there's a much bigger, there's a much bigger issue here. Evan, when you 
started the show here, we go again, I thought we were going into the 
pipeline debate. Like how, here we are, day after day, month after month
 debating these 19th century economic levers. Where is the renewable 
energy project that stands like a beacon, a nation building project from
 coast to coast to coast in this country, that actually announces 
Canada, in the abdication of the United States from real climate 
progress, we have an opportunity lead the world in renewable energy. We 
have extraordinary capacity here and we have communities across the 
country that are already doing it on a small scale because we're missing
 the big picture. Where's the vision for this 21st century economy that 
could lead the Canada?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Okay last word to Stephanie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEVITZ: But to pay it for, you need the export the <b>oil</b>, and, and that's the problem that Justin Trudeau has right?</p>

of the ever-controversial Trans Mountain pipeline expansion? "I'm very

best for Alberta's economy and best for Canada's economy." Spoiler 
alert: It wasn't Premier Rachel Notley or Energy Minister Margaret

 for the death of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> 's $7.4
 billion project is also hopeful the pipeline expansion will, in fact, 
go ahead. This would seem to be double-think on an Orwellian scale. But 
it's just another day in the topsy-turvy world of Alberta politics made 
even topsy-turvier by the chaotic results of the British Columbia 
election. Alberta's conservative parties are gleefully watching the B.C.

government of convenience.</p>

 Wildrose and Progressive Conservatives are amused, not because they are
 fans of either left party, but because the anti-pipeline NDP/Green 
alliance is making life so difficult for Notley. The B.C. alliance is 
promising to use "every tool available" to kill the pipeline project. 
That has Jean taunting Notley for failing to convince her NDP cousins in
 B.C. that Alberta's climate plan - with its controversial carbon tax - 
fulfills the requirement for a <b>social license</b>. "Premier Notley and Prime Minister Trudeau have talked-up <b>social license</b> as a supposed way to get pipelines approved," said Jean, "but anyone with common sense will see that <b>social license</b> is the snake <b>oil</b> of the 21st century." But Jean, like most politicians, can be a bit of a snake <b>oil</b>
 salesman himself. When I asked what he would do as premier to convince 
the NDP and Greens to support the pipeline, he had a curious answer: "I 
would go to B.C. and I would talk to the B.C. government about how we 
could make sure this gets through, and if we have to look at other 
alternatives or anything we possibly can to move it forward, I would do 
that." It's a curious answer, because he made it sound as if he could 
build a better relationship with an NDP government in B.C. than could 
Notley, who is, um, an NDP premier who happens to be good friends with 
John Horgan , leader of the B.C. NDP. When I pressed Jean on how he 
would have better relations with the NDP in B.C., he said this: "I try 
to have good relationships with everybody. I can tell you one thing 
right now, you don't pick fights with your neighbours, either to the 
east or west, Saskatchewan or B.C., and expect to have good 
relationships in the future." Not picking fights with your neighbours is
 probably good advice. Jean was slyly alluding to Notley's ongoing war 
of words with Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall over their duelling 
budgets. However, Jean's comment would have carried more weight if 
Wildrose MLA Derek Fildebrandt hadn't chosen that moment to tweet out a 
shot at the NDP/Green alliance. "The inmates are running the asylum," 
said Fildebrandt as he linked to a live feed of the NDP/Green signing 
ceremony. That gave Notley an opening in question period Wednesday to 
take a whack at the hypocrisy of the Wildrose: "While the leader (Jean) 
was outside telling the press that he was totally able to have a good 
working relationship with the B.C. government, his front bench was 
tweeting, calling them lunatics in an asylum." Notley also accused the 
Wildrose of "cheering for Alberta's failure," by being so negative on 
the prospects for the Trans Mountain project. But based on Jean's "I'm 
hopeful that it will go through" comment, he is quietly cheering on the 
pipeline. You have to wonder, though, if construction on the project 
begins later this year or early next (as <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> hopes), will Jean then declare Notley's <b>social license</b> policy to be a success? gthomson@postmedia.com( mailto:gthomson@postmedia.com )</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's an odd situation. But we live in odd economic circumstances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Immediately firing up 
Phase II of the soon-to-open Sturgeon Refinery outside Fort Saskatchewan
 will require a massive provincial government commitment. This, in a 
province that since Ralph Klein days has liked the notion of government 
staying out of business.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this commitment, in the long run, makes sense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And despite Ralph's 
proclamation, previous Conservative governments have already 
substantially invested in Phase I of the new refinery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the New Democrat government is being asked to do the same for Phase II.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downside is minimal: in a worst-case scenario, the government could lose money for periods of time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upside is 
substantial: in the long run, the province is highly likely to make good
 profits (see below). Major construction jobs - 5,000 to 8,000 of them -
 could be created over the next four years when little else is 
happening; fabrication shops and other sub-contractors would be kept 
busy; new tax revenues would come on stream - right now, the refinery 
pays $40 million a year in property taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, serious economic
 diversification could be at hand, manufacturing valueadded petroleum 
products in Alberta instead of shipping raw bitumen out of province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A little background knowledge is in order.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta government doesn't collect its oilsands royalties in cash, but in kind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through the Alberta 
Petroleum Marketing Corporation, the Alberta government is already a big
 direct player in the oilsands. It collects and sells about 20% of the 
total bitumen produced around Fort McMurray. The government agency 
competes with Suncor, Syncrude, etc., in selling bitumen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state-of-the-art 
Sturgeon Refinery was built because the government agreed to send a 
small percentage of its bitumen to the refinery over the next 30 years. 
By the end of this year, the refinery will be making 40,000 barrels a 
day of valueadded diesel fuel from the bitumen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's the odd part: The 
government will continue to own the diesel fuel that emerges out of the 
other end of the refinery. The refinery is essentially a service 
provider. It converts government-owned bitumen to government-owned 
diesel for a small per-barrel fee. It's the government that then will 
sell the diesel - in Western Canada or wherever it can be shipped by 
pipeline, rail or truck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NW Refining's CEO and 
President Ian MacGregor is proposing the provincial government double up
 on the existing deal ... enabling Phase II of the refinery to get 
underway, to increase its high-grade, low-sulphur and low-carbon diesel 
production from 40,000 to 80,000 barrels a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why does the refinery 
need the government's bitumen? Because, says MacGregor, it's available 
while most of the other oilsands producers use their own bitumen, either
 for upgrading or to sell to American refineries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why should government 
take the risk of owning and selling diesel fuel? Simple: the refinery 
would not otherwise have been built. Financial lenders would only take 
on such risk with higher repayment terms. The refinery would not have 
been economically viable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What would accelerating 
Phase II do for Alberta? Lots: Employ 5,000 to 8,000 tradespeople over 
the next four years, when there's little other industrial building 
taking place. Create new tax revenue - the refinery currently pays over 
$40 million a year in property tax alone. Giving the government the 
likelihood, especially in the long run, of making more money from 
creating and selling diesel fuel rather than selling raw bitumen. <b>Social license</b>:
 the government is selling the best diesel made in Canada - top quality,
 ultra-low in sulphur, qualifying as a lowcarbon diesel fuel which is in
 high demand. The refinery has zero carbon emissions thanks to a C02 
collection system that not only buries CO2 underground, but assists in 
recovering conventional <b>oil</b> from old wells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not crazy about such intense government involvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But MacGregor makes a great case for immediately building Phase II of the Sturgeon Refinery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The province is an owner
 of this resource, and should behave like an owner," he says. 
"Diversification and creating new products out of bitumen enhances value
 and income. Over half the bitumen produced by <b>oil</b> companies in 
the oilsands is upgraded or refined - it's good business! "We shouldn't 
be selling raw bitumen, untaxed, with no job creation. Right now, none 
of the bitumen owned by the government is processed in Alberta. Even 
after Phase II, only eight per cent of the provincially owned bitumen 
will be processed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've moaned and groaned enough about diversification. For heaven's sake, let's get on with it!"</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luc English is based in 
Nicaragua and has over 20 years’ experience as an Exploration Geologist 
and Manager. He has spent the past 10 years in Nicaragua where he 
successfully led <span class="companylink">Condor</span> Gold’s 
exploration team from concession acquisition, through exploration and 
resource development to a pre-feasibility mining study on the La India 
Gold Project. He also recently represented geological consultants <span class="companylink">CSA Global</span>
 managing geotechnical drilling for a proposed interoceanic canal across
 Nicaragua. His training as an exploration geologist was gained in 
Australia, Eritrea and Gabon on gold and multi-commodity exploration 
projects. He has explored for a number of different commodities in a 
variety of different geological settings. He was the geologist 
responsible for the resource definition and bankable feasibility study 
of two satellite open pits on the Coyote Gold Mine in Central Australia,
 and prior to that for the resource definition of satellite open pits 
for the Jundee Gold Mine in Western Australia. He has also worked as a 
technical consultant for the <b>oil</b> and gas industry in the UK and Middle East. Luc holds a PhD in Geology from the <span class="companylink">University of Cambridge</span> and a BSc in Geology from the <span class="companylink">University of Bristol</span>. He is a Chartered Geologist with <span class="companylink">the Geological Society of London</span>
 and a European Geologist with the European Federation of Geologists, 
recognised as a “Competent Person” under JORC, PERC and a “Qualified 
Person” under NI 43-101.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Project Acquisition Update</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company continues to 
review numerous precious metals projects and companies for potential 
acquisition. Management remains focused, disciplined and selective in 
its due diligence activities as projects must demonstrate the ability to
 be developed into high margin, strong free cash flowing mining 
operations which in turn generate significant value accretion for 
shareholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold Exploration Portfolio, Peru</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As previously announced on April 10, 2017, <span class="companylink">Rio2 Limited</span>, through its whole owned subsidiary Rio2 Exploraciones S.A.C. has entered into a mining assignment and option agreement with <span class="companylink">Compañia Minera Milpo</span>
 S.A.A. pursuant to which it has the right and option to acquire all 
rights and interests in 7 gold exploration prospects totalling 
approximately 19,000 hectares in Peru.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rio2 has recently 
completed site visits to each of the prospects and is in the process of 
planning and prioritizing a first phase exploration program for the 
coming months. Social and community fieldwork has commenced to 
facilitate the gaining of <b>social license</b> for the work programs the Company is planning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company will provide updates to shareholders as it advances its activities on these properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicaragua Strategy</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rio2 has recently applied
 for 10,000 hectares of exploration concessions in Nicaragua as the 
Company ranks the country highly as a destination to do business in the 
mining sector in Latin America. Recognizing the mining sector’s 
potential to boost the country’s gross domestic product and economic 
growth, the Nicaraguan government, through the Ministry of Energy and 
Mines, is actively promoting investments by having established a solid 
legal framework and facilitating the development of mining projects in 
the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bordering Honduras to the
 north, and Costa Rica to the south, Nicaragua’s mining tradition dates 
back to the nineteenth century and has since become one of the country’s
 most dynamic economic sectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rio2 understands that 
less than 10% of the country is currently under exploration and all 
current mining operations are taking place in three historical 
districts: the Golden Triangle (Bonanza, Siuna and Rosita), La 
Libertad/Santo Domingo, and El Limón/La India. The Company intends to 
leverage off of Country Manager, Luc English’s ten years of experience 
of exploring in the country, to acquire precious metals prospects that 
have the potential of being able to be developed into highly profitable 
mining ventures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company will provide updates to shareholders as it advances its activities in Nicaragua.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About Rio2</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The focus of Rio2 is to 
compile an attractive portfolio of precious metals assets that can be 
developed into mines and to assemble a highly experienced technical and 
corporate management team with a solid experience base of developing and
 building mines in South, Central and North America. Through its 
strategy of evaluating and acquiring precious metals projects and 
through a combination of organic exploration and development and 
strategic acquisitions, the management team intends to grow Rio2 and 
create long-term shareholder value through the development of 
high-margin, strong free cash flowing mining operations.</p>

 and gas executives believe that the industry is doing a poor job of 
communicating with the masses on major issues, a potential worry for an 
industry that requires <b>social license</b> to operate, the consulting firm EY found in an annual report on perceptions of the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EY found that 75% of 
executive respondents believe that the industry is doing a "fair" or 
"poor" job communicating with the public, with only 3% believing that 
the industry is doing an "excellent" job. Respondents were even more 
negative when it came to the industry explaining the impact of 
regulations to the public, with 2% saying they do an excellent job and 
78% grading it fair or poor.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 executives were more positive on the idea of communicating about what 
it takes to operate safely, with 54% giving positive marks. 75% said the
 industry was a being a good corporate citizen, and 83% said <b>oil</b> and gas companies were doing an excellent or good job leveraging technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps in part due to 
the perceived inability to get their message out to the public, industry
 executives were more pessimistic on the way the public views them 
compared to how they are viewed in reality. More than three-quarters of 
executives said they believed that the public did not trust them, when 
the actual split was 53%-47% in favor of not trusting, according to the 
public polling phase of the study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy executives also 
said they are doing a poor job attracting young people to work in the 
industry, with only 43% giving an excellent or good rating. EY's look at
 consumer sentiment for the industry indicated that executives may be on
 to something, with 56% of teens ages 16 and 18 saying they do not trust
 the industry and only 42% viewing it positively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, which was 
based on interviews with 109 executives and a survey of 1,204 consumers 
aged 16 and up, was released May 10. The survey group included 200 
respondents aged 16 to 18.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EY U.S. Energy Leader Deborah Byers said <b>oil</b> and gas companies should reconsider how they advertise the industry, as young men and women interested in technology see the <b>oil</b> and gas business as largely blue-collar work and as not using some of the world's most advanced systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is more of a case for action than there has been in the past," she said. "It has become more important to have a <b>social license</b> to operate. It's something we need to concentrate on. [Younger respondents] are not looking at the paper; they're looking at <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>. There are a lot more powerful voices there [for opponents] than the industry."</p>
