 pundits should not be so quick to write off the new Doug Ford-Scott Moe
 alliance against the federal carbon tax. Yes, they were the only two of
 the 10 provincial premiers in New Brunswick this week to announce their
 support for a constitutional challenge to the federal law. And yes 
constitutional experts are correct in predicting that this legal 
challenge is not likely to succeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But winning in the legal 
battle does not mean winning the policy war. Obstructionist provincial 
governments can gum up federal policies whose effective implementation 
require provincial co-operation. Witness how B.C. Premier John Horgan 
and his antipipeline allies have succeeded in delaying the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline expansion despite losing 17 consecutive court decisions.</p>

 respect to the carbon tax, the law may be on the side of Ottawa, but 
time and politics are not. Saskatchewan's reference to its court of 
appeal won't be decided for another nine months. Whoever loses will 
appeal to the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>, 
which will take another year or more to be heard and then decided. By 
then, there will have been a spring election in Alberta and a federal 
election in the fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Alberta, Conservative 
leader Jason Kenney is promising to scrap that province's carbon tax if 
he wins next year's election. All current polling suggests that he will.
 Manitoba has adopted its own version of a carbon tax, but the price it 
places on CO2 is below the minimum demanded by the federal plan. Premier
 Pallister has warned that if Ottawa tries to force it higher, "we'll 
see you in court." P.E.I. has adopted a climate change plan with no 
carbon tax - a policy that clearly does not meet federal regulations. 
And if anti-tax momentum builds, the Newfoundland and New Brunswick 
premiers have warned that they are not going to impose a tax on their 
voters that consumers and businesses in six or seven other provinces are
 not paying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With next year's federal 
election fast approaching, this is potential nightmare scenario for 
Trudeau and the Liberals. Do they want to make the ballot-issue a new 
tax that will make it more expensive for voters to fill up their cars, 
heat their homes and turn on their lights? Maybe this won't make any 
difference in Saskatchewan and Alberta, where the Liberals only have 
five MPs. But in Ontario - where Doug Ford just won by promising to 
scrap the tax - the Liberals have 80 MPs seeking reelection. Losing even
 a quarter of these would jeopardize their 183-seat government, which is
 only 13 over the 170 minimum required for a majority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2015, many 
centre-right voters supported Trudeau simply because they were tired of 
Stephen Harper. But in 2018, they supported Doug Ford because they were 
tired of skyrocketing electricity and <b>gas</b> prices. If in 2019 
Trudeau takes a hardline on bringing back the very carbon tax that 
Premier Ford has just repealed, he risks losing some of these former 
supporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the alternative - 
backing off on the carbon tax - has its own risks. Promising action on 
climate change was one of the issues that helped Trudeau win in 2015. 
With the help of the U.S.-financed environmental NGO (EN-GO) Leadnow, 
the Liberals targeted 29 Conservative-held ridings in which their 
polling indicated that climate change was a priority for voters. Liberal
 candidates subsequently won 25 of these seats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these same 
centre-left voters that supported Trudeau in 2015 are no longer so happy
 with him. Many are angry about the federal government's $4.5-billion 
bailout of the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline 
expansion in B.C. If Trudeau now backs down on his national carbon tax 
pledge, many of his 2015 supporters for whom climate action is still a 
priority may drift off to the NDP in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underlying the Liberals'carbon tax dilemma is the spectacular failure of the Trudeau-Notley "<b>social licence</b>"
 gambit: their belief that in return for their various carbon reduction 
policies, climate change ENGOs would acquiesce in Canada's economic need
 to build the Kinder Morgan Trans-Mountain expansion. Whatever 
plausibility this trade-off strategy may have had initially has now been
 destroyed. The anti-Kinder Morgan forces - the Horgan government, U.S. 
and Canadian climate ENGOs and B.C. Aboriginal groups - have accelerated
 their opposition to TransMountain, not backed off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor are they shy about explaining why. When CBC asked Bill Mc-Kibben, founder of <span class="companylink">350.org</span>,
 why he would not give Trudeau and Notley any credit for Canada's carbon
 reduction policies, he stated a simple fact: that at only two per cent 
of global emissions, what Canada does on the domestic "demand" side to 
reduce our emissions is too small to make any difference. What will make
 a difference, McKibben continued, is preventing the further development
 of the Canadian oil sands - the third largest reserve on the world. "To
 stop the oil sands, we have to stop all pipelines."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The failure of his <b>social licence</b> strategy forced Trudeau to rescue the TransMountain expansion with the $4.5-billion purchase of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada</span>.
 This did not win him many new friends in Alberta or Saskatchewan, but 
infuriated many of his erstwhile climate change supporters in Ontario 
and British Columbia. With an election only a year away, the carbon tax 
issue threatens to push the Liberals even deeper into a political corner
 with no easy way out.</p>

JDT105</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new natural resources minister is Amarjeet Sohi, from Edmonton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is immediately a rare 
specimen. Many eastern Liberals worry that an Albertan in the top energy
 job will not be sufficiently contemptuous of the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last Liberal in this post was Edmonton MP Anne McLellan, who, like Sohi, counted her victory margins in tens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This appointment is a big
 boost for Sohi's hopes. It's also a clear signal from Prime Minister 
Justin Trudeau that developing non-U.S. markets is now a key priority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa is in the process 
of buying Trans Mountain for $4.5 billion, so it would be damn peculiar 
if Sohi started dissing it. He also supports Line 3 and Keystone XL, 
cross-border projects already in the works</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the larger emphasis now is on ways of shipping east and west, rather than south.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are committed to 
selling our resources and expanding our markets not only internally, but
 also externally, to non-US markets," Sohi said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Relying on a single customer is not a good thing, and that's becoming more and more clear now, with the uncertainties around <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> ... we need to sell our resources to other markets."</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On
 March 18, 2016, Canada's Minister of Finance, Bill Morneau, established
 the Advisory Council on Economic Growth and charged it with the 
development of advice on concrete policy actions to help create the 
conditions for strong and sustained long-term economic growth. More than
 a year later, how well has the government done with that advice? If we 
look at the council's first report Bringing Foreign Investment to 
Canada, it put emphasis on the importance of attracting foreign 
investment, which is certainly a worthy goal. The report stated that 
"Foreign direct investment (FDI) is a critical driver of economic 
growth...</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
 it strengthens Canadian productive capacity through knowledge transfer,
 the development of human capital, and new technology, management 
techniques, and production processes." It recommends the establishment 
of a Foreign Direct Investment Agency, which "in its first few years of 
operation, can raise the growth rate of inbound FDI from its current two
 per cent to six per cent annually... and would add approximately $43 
billion to Canada's GDP - an amount currently equal to two per cent of 
our national income."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, what's the Liberal 
government's record to date on attracting foreign direct investment? The
 accompanying graph is worth a thousand words. It shows that, in fact, 
since 2013 the inflow of FDI fell substantially, and the pace has only 
accelerated after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government 
took office in 2015. The amount reached a low of $30 billion in 2017 and
 is likely to decrease further in 2018. The purchase by the <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span> of the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline business alone will reduce the amount by over $4 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Important also is the 
amount of FDI made by Canadians abroad, instead of being invested here 
at home. The graph shows that outflows, too, have increased steadily 
since 2011 and reached a record $100 billion in 2017. As a result, in 
that year the balance of Canada's FDI account (outflows minus inflows) 
was about negative $4 billion. A far cry from what the government had 
planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the importance of 
FDI for economic growth, these statistics make it clear we need to 
understand why this deterioration in Canada's FDI account took place. 
Some causes are developments beyond our government's control, such as 
recent reductions in U.S. corporate income tax rates and regulations, 
lower oil and <b>gas</b> prices, and the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate accord.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, much blame for this deterioration stems from recent Canadian policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As discussed recently in these pages by Jack Mintz and William Robson, and in a recent <span class="companylink">Fraser Institute</span> publication by Niels Veldhuis, Milagros Palacios and Jason Clemens, these policies worsened the investment climate in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This worsening resulted 
from the increase in environmental and climate policies such as: The 
mandated closing of coal-fired electricitygenerating plants in Ontario 
(and the rapid rise in electricity prices that followed); the capping of
 future extraction of oil in Alberta; and the prohibition of tanker 
traffic along the northern coast of British Columbia and of pipelines in
 B.C.'s Great Bear Rainforest. There was also the imposition of stricter
 conditions on the construction of pipelines to prevent oil spills and 
the requirement to obtain "<b>social licence</b>" before one could be built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worsening of the 
investment climate is also due to the pursuit of the "progressive" 
political agenda in vogue lately across Canada, including: Heavier 
regulation of equity policies in pay and employment; increases in 
minimum wages; and restrictions on property development and the 
imposition of more stringent building codes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most important 
element of this progressive agenda has been the increase in taxes on 
corporations and high-income individuals and the prospect of still 
higher taxes through rising carbon taxes. Since an important part of the
 cost of the progressive agenda is covered by deficits, the growing debt
 portends even higher taxes in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly politicians and 
some proportion of Canadians are certain to consider the costs of these 
policies to be worth the benefits brought by improvements in 
environmental protection, the prevention of global warming and better 
social conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upcoming federal and 
provincial elections, like the one that just decimated the Liberals in 
Ontario, will continue to reveal how prevalent this view is among 
voters.</p>

appreciate being shamed by elites who have no trouble making ends meet 
for rejecting a policy that has wreaked havoc on household budgets

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Poll after poll shows just how unpopular this carbon tax is, and with good reason - it hasn't done a thing to reduce greenhouse <b>gas</b> emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, it simply 
punishes Alberta consumers by increasing the cost of everything from 
heating our homes in the winter to putting <b>gas</b> in the vehicle that gets us to work each day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What it has done is drive
 emissions, along with good, mortgage-paying jobs, to jurisdictions 
without a punitive carbon tax regime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We already see energy jobs booming in places like North Dakota and Texas, while the oil and <b>gas</b> workers in Alberta remain unemployed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact of the matter is
 that Albertans were sold a false bill of goods when the NDP introduced 
its carbon tax - a tax they never campaigned on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were told that it would buy us the so-called "<b>social licence</b>" we needed to get shovels in the ground on a pipeline to tidewater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not one pipeline

economy with a punitive tax on everything - are now doing everything in 
their power to block Trans Mountain.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, rather than admit it

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, I know that 
Albertans are smarter than that, and I know they do not believe for a 
minute that the only way to address climate change is through a carbon

</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But <span class="companylink">Goldcorp</span>
 harbours big ambitions to make it the first all-electric underground 
mine in Canada where everything from the trucks that haul ore, to the 
ventilation system that provides oxygen to its subterranean workers, run
 off energy taken from the electrical grid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All mines are finite 
projects, making them in one sense, unsustainable. Still, in an era when
 countries around the world have pledged to curb carbon emissions, many 
mining companies are citing "sustainability" as a core value and are 
making strides to limit their environmental impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Barrick Gold</span>, <span class="companylink">Endeavour Silver Corp</span>.
 and other companies released reports in the past month that sought to 
measure their "sustainability" by looking at environmental impacts, 
community relations, safety records and other metrics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With diesel prices rising
 in tandem with oil prices, the quest for sustainability also has pushed
 many companies to look closely at their energy usage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not just 
necessarily because of the environment," said Brent Bergeron, Goldcorp's
 executive vice-president of corporate affairs and sustainability. 
"There's very interesting financial benefits we can get by actually 
becoming smarter about how we produce and use power generation at our 
sites."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In choosing a mine to 
experiment with how to wean itself off diesel, the Borden project made 
sense, he said, because of its small size and its location in Ontario, 
where a cap-and-trade program came into effect earlier this year. The 
program sets a limit on a company's greenhouse <b>gas</b> emissions, above which they need to purchase credits at auctions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although electricity is 
expensive in Ontario, Bergeron said there is access to renewable energy 
sources such as hydro, which will lower the company's carbon footprint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside the mine itself, it is also using electric-powered 40-tonne haul trucks, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Those trucks don't exist
 yet," Bergeron said, adding that the company urged the supplier to 
build them or else the company would find a different supplier that 
could build them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also obvious benefits to switching to the grid. By using electricity for its air ventilation system, <span class="companylink">Goldcorp</span> stopped spewing diesel particulate into the air it must keep clean for its workers, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think that what you're
 seeing today is mining companies trying to really push the 
sustainability side of what we're doing," said Bergeron, "but also look 
at it from the point of view of these technologies do exist, they have 
been proven, so let's try and get them into some of our projects."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other companies cited 
additional benefits of moving their mines off diesel and onto the grid 
completely unrelated to the environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Pan American Silver Corp</span>., which 
recently released a report on its sustainability, built a 98-kilometre 
power line to connect its open pit silver gold Dolores mine in Mexico to
 the national power grid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Constructed in late 2016 
at a cost of $20 million, it has resulted in savings of about $9 million
 per year, according to spokeswoman Siren Fisekci.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located in an area of 
Mexico that has been riven by violence, possibly linked to drug cartels,
 last month, the mine temporarily closed after a decapitated body was 
found on a road near the mine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When we bring supplies 
in there, you're looking at 120 to 140 kilometre road to bring them in 
there," said Fisekci, who added that the power line allows the mine to 
operate regardless of conditions on the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some mining companies say
 energy accounts for 10 per cent of operating costs at a mine, which is 
inducement enough to look for savings through renewable energy or 
otherwise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, on another 
continent, amid the dusty, semi-arid landscape of northern Namibia in 
southern Africa, executives from Vancouver-based B2Gold Corp. stood with
 local dignitaries in early June to ring in the opening of a seven 
megawatt solar panel plant it built to help power its nearby open pit 
gold mine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built at a cost of $8.5 
million, it is expected to help the company save about 13 per cent on 
its energy usage at the open pit per year - about $16.5 million over the
 next decade or so, according to the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Bill Lytle, senior vice-president of operations for <span class="companylink">B2Gold</span>,
 acknowledged that the open pit mine would "scar the earth," but also 
noted that the mine had an estimated lifespan of about 10 years, 
depending on whether there is future exploration and other factors. 
Regardless, at the end of the mine life, the plan is to fill the pit 
with water and make it into a lake, then convert the surrounding area 
into a nature reserve, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the solar plant has a lifespan of 25 years, meaning it could outlast the mine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think all mining 
companies will tell you to some degree they're doing some sort of 
sustainability," said Lytle. "It is a requirement to maintain your <b>social licence</b> to operate."</p>

 is scepticism at the head office of one of the world’s biggest energy 
companies about whether Canada can build megaprojects on time and on 
budget, says a Canadian representative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corporation</span>
 (Sinopec), which bills itself as the world’s biggest refiner and 
second-biggest petrochemical producer, was one of China’s big three 
state-owned energy companies that invested in Canada’s oil and <b>gas</b> industry this century. The others are <span class="companylink">China National Offshore Oil Corporation</span> (<span class="companylink">CNOOC</span>) and <span class="companylink">PetroChina</span>.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, though, neither has attempted to build any multibillion-dollar projects here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Brian Tuffs, CEO of Sinopec Canada, took part in a panel discussion at a <b>Gas</b> Processing Association of Canada (GPAC) lunch on Wednesday. The subject was Canada’s natural <b>gas</b> future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuffs, who often travels 
to Sinopec’s Beijing office, responded to a questions about Canada’s 
competitiveness and ability to build major energy projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When I look at Beijing 
... they’re very much in a wait-and-see attitude,” he said, referring to
 perceptions about Canada’s ability to built projects — especially 
megaprojects — on time and on budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Until we actually get 
something committed, and get something completed, I think there is a lot
 of scepticism about Canada’s ability to actually execute on a project,”
 Tuffs told the well-attended Calgary event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to Canadian competitiveness, Tuffs has a fairly unique perspective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sinopec, which has about 
800,000 employees, is active in 26 countries. So Sinopec Canada’s 
proposed capital projects have to compete internally for funding against
 projects around the world. (He said Sinopec’s Canadian production is 
about 60,000-65,000 boe/d, roughly half <b>gas</b> and half oil.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I would say, speaking as
 a CEO of an entity that competes with 26 other countries for funding 
[within Sinopec], that we in Canada struggle to compete [for] capital,” 
Tuffs told the GPAC event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He sought “to dispel any 
lingering myths” about the Chinese government’s commercial priorities, 
arguing that making money doesn’t take a back seat to shipping physical 
barrels to China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our single most 
important corporate target is net free cash flow,” he said. “We want to 
have more money coming in than every last dollar that goes out. And if 
we’re successful, then that’s how we do it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When I talk to the big 
guys over in Beijing, they’ll say, ‘Look Brian, we don’t need 
necessarily for you to provide barrels to China. Make us money. If we 
have money, the world will sell us [oil].’”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: “We operate on a
 100 per cent commercial basis. And we compete internationally against 
all those other international projects.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuffs has witnessed China’s fast-paced conversion to natural <b>gas</b> as the government strives to improve notoriously bad air quality in cities such as Beijing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He believes Canada, with its vast <b>gas</b> resources and tiny domestic demand, has a “tremendous opportunity.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have a federal 
government which, broadly speaking, would like to build stronger trade 
relations with countries such as China. We share a common Pacific 
coastline with Southeast Asia. So we should be the favoured supplier of 
natural <b>gas</b> to those new markets.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it has to be able to compete on cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think, though, when we look at competitiveness, it’s not just about getting a <b>social licence</b> to do our work. It’s about having a cost structure which is competitive,” Tuffs said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“At the moment, when we 
look at our markets, our traditional market in the Lower 48. ... We’re 
at the wrong end of the pipeline to supply the U.S. We’re competing 
against <b>gas</b> from Texas [and] Louisiana.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in global <b>gas</b> 
markets, Canada’s first LNG export project will have to compete with 
expansions at existing LNG projects — and brownfield projects have a 
cost advantage over greenfield projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There’s no premium that a
 buyer is going to pay for a methane molecule that comes from Canada. 
They’re not going to pay extra because we’ve got a little Maple Leaf or a
 polar bear on our methane,” Tuffs said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What the international 
markets care about is cost and reliability of supply. And those are the 
only two things that as a buyer of LNG, [including] Sinopec, cares 
about. How cheap can I get it? And how reliable is the source?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy costs are 
especially important to China because this key input affects the supply 
costs of the country’s entire industrial chain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If their energy costs go
 too high, then their manufacturing cost becomes too high, and they 
become uncompetitive,” Tuffs said. “And [if] the economy of China 
stalls, [it] has implications ... for the global economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So we need to look at the competitiveness of our cost structure as well as actually getting a <b>social licence</b>.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Susannah Pierce, external relations director of the proposed Kitimat, 
B.C. LNG Canada export project, also stressed the importance of being 
able to compete on cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Royal Dutch Shell plc</span>-led project, which is expected to decide this year on whether to proceed, would be built from scratch at a greenfield site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Most of the other parts 
of the world where we’re competing already have a lot of capital 
infrastructure in the ground,” Pierce told the GPAC lunch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She emphasized the LNG industry is extremely capital intensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are dealing with 
competitors — whether that be the U.S. Gulf Coast [or] Australia [or] 
Qatar — which really are all about expansion. And as we know, expansions
 are less capital intensive, for the most part.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTERRE UPDATES LITIGATION FOR QUEBEC ASSETS; ANNOUNCES SPUD OF KAKWA NORTH WELL</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questerre Energy Corp</span>. has provided an update on the status of legal proceedings related to its assets in Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pursuant to a letter of 
intent with a senior exploration and production company to acquire its 
Quebec assets (LOI), as reported on June 4, 2018, on closing of the 
transaction, both parties will release each other from all claims 
related to the outstanding litigation. In the interim, the parties 
anticipate entering into a standstill agreement to postpone all actions 
and toll any other litigation to allow for closing of the transaction. 
In preparation for trial, the company recently obtained an independent 
assessment of its damages that are estimated to range between 
$49.7-million and $243-million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company also reported
 that the first well on its Kakwa North acreage, the 16-29-063-06W6M 
well, spudded late last week. The well is programmed with a lateral of 
approximately 2,800 metres. Questerre holds a royalty interest in the 
16-29 well.</p>

Mr. Michael Binnion reports</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTERRE SETTLES LAWSUIT AND CONSOLIDATES QUEBEC POSITION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questerre Energy Corp</span>. has executed a 
letter of intent with a senior exploration and production company to 
settle outstanding litigation and acquire all its assets in the St. 
Lawrence Lowlands, Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, president and chief executive officer of Questerre, 
commented: "On closing, we will gain operatorship of our acreage in the 
lowlands. We will be in a much better position to communicate directly 
with municipalities and address local concerns and acceptability. Our 
approach is that good relationships with local communities comes first 
and development second.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We will continue our 
step-by-step approach of working with the government and municipalities.
 This project will proceed by adequately addressing their concerns and 
making sure they participate in the benefits. We are confident that, 
with success, this project will help Quebec greatly reduce its 
hydrocarbon import problem and meet its 2030 energy policy targets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pursuant to the LOI, 
Questerre will acquire the exploration rights to 753,000 net acres in 
the lowlands, associated wells and equipment, geological and geophysical
 data, and other miscellaneous assets. Upon closing of the transaction, 
both parties will release each other from all claims related to the 
outstanding litigation. Other consideration including cash and the 
security required for the assumption of abandonment and reclamation 
liabilities (A&amp;R liabilities) is approximately $16.1-million in 
aggregate. Questerre may post a letter of credit as security for the 
A&amp;R liabilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Closing of the 
transaction is subject to the enactment by the Ministry of Energy and 
Natural Resources in Quebec of the following regulations: (i) the 
regulation respecting petroleum exploration, production and storage in a
 body of water; (ii) the regulation respecting petroleum exploration, 
production and storage on land; and (iii) the regulation respecting 
petroleum exploration, production and storage licences, and pipeline 
construction or use authorization. The company anticipates the final 
regulations could be published around the end of the second quarter of 
this year. Additional conditions to closing include the execution of a 
purchase and sale agreement.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's decision to buy out <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s
 pipeline interest is best understood as making the best of a very bad 
situation, but a situation that he is responsible for creating.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's be clear: A federally owned pipeline is hardly what anyone wanted. But it's better than no pipeline at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost all growth in 
global oil demand in the next 20 years – and it's big, a 30-per-cent 
increase – will be in Asia. New access to export markets other than the 
United States is critical if Canada is to stop selling our oil at huge 
discounts. It's time to keep that money here – along with the private 
sector jobs and government revenues that it creates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.C. Premier John Horgan's death-by-delay strategy was working against <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 because for a private company, time is money – their money. But it 
won't work against Ottawa. Ottawa has lots of time and lots of money – 
other people's money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals' hope is 
that the futility of further delaying tactics will be so obvious that 
the B.C. government will abandon their rope-a-dope strategy. Or if they 
don't, one or two defections and/or several recall elections will force 
Mr. Horgan's minority government into a non-confidence vote and a new 
election sooner rather than later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But beyond that, there's 
nothing positive about Tuesday's announcement. It was an 11th-hour 
government bailout of a privately funded pipeline project that had met 
all the requirements for approval. Will that inspire investor confidence
 going forward? Hardly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How was the $4.5-billion 
purchase price arrived at? With Mr. Trudeau – or his emissary, the poor 
Finance Minister Bill Morneau – on his knees in Houston, begging. By 
April of this year, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> 
understood that Mr. Trudeau and Canada needed the Trans Mountain 
expansion much more than they did. The Prime Minister had 
single-handedly destroyed all of Canada's other options to reach new 
export markets – first Northern Gateway, then Energy East.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All that was left was Trans Mountain. Did <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 price gouge on the purchase price? Of course. And why shouldn't they, 
given what has happened – or rather, not happened – in the past year?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The point is that it should never have reached this stage. By January of last year, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> had met every requirement of both the federal <span class="companylink">National Energy Board (NEB) </span>process and B.C.'s five conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what's been going on 
for the past 15 months? Some will point to the May, 2017, election of 
the NDP minority government in B.C. and their pledge to “use every tool 
in the toolbox" to block the Trans Mountain expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, the B.C. election 
was a proximate cause, but the deeper, formal cause has been Mr. 
Trudeau's own public rhetoric on climate change. From Paris onward, he 
has aided and abetted the antipipeline movement by repeating the 
climate-change militants' own dogmas, stigmatizing Canada's oil and <b>gas</b>
 industry and undermining the reputation of the NEB. All of this has 
legitimated and emboldened the very groups that are now trying to block 
the Trans Mountain expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the one positive to come out of all of this is that we won't have to listen to any more nonsense about <b>social licence</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposition that 
imposing carbon taxes, closing down coalfired electricity and 
subsidizing renewables would turn pipeline opponents into pipeline 
supporters has failed completely. Try to name one convert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or listen to U.S. environmentalist Bill McKibben of <span class="companylink">350.org</span> or our own climate-change wizard, David Suzuki. Both are adamant that all oil sands oil must stay in the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trudeau has been 
speaking out of both sides of his mouth since he was elected, and now it
 has caught up with him. In Paris, he paraded as the Prince of Climate 
Change. When he was in Houston, he was a champion for export pipelines. 
He wanted it both ways, but now he can't: He owns a pipeline and has 
promised to complete it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To do this, he will have 
to go to battle with the very groups that supported him in the 2015 
election – urban climate-change activists, Indigenous communities and 
maybe Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile Mr. Trudeau's 
new, erstwhile allies in this battle – Alberta, Saskatchewan, the energy
 sector and other business interests – did not support him in 2015 and, 
for the reasons discussed above, are no more likely to support him in 
2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the next election 
only 17 months away, the Liberals are in trouble and they know it. Mr. 
Trudeau is the architect of his party's demise. But the rest of us will 
have to pay for it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">HTC PURENERGY INC</span>. ANNOUNCES UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER PERIOD ENDING MARCH 31, 2018</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">HTC Purenergy Inc</span>. has released its unaudited condensed consolidated financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HTC Purenergy and its 
subsidiaries have chosen to refocus its business units in the 
environmental technologies sector. The acceptance of climate change and 
the <b>social licence</b> that corporations are moving toward are upon 
the company in force. Carbon footprint and the capture and management of
 CO2 (carbon dioxide) has become effectively a currency of business, a 
vehicle for penalty and taxation, and a statement to shareholders who 
expect environmental responsibility from the companies they invest in. 
The company notes that all segments of the energy sector must contribute
 and, as such, the management of CO2 from combustion-fired plants can be
 used not only to reduce emissions, but also to improve oil production 
through the use of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques. HTC has 
focused its efforts in this area over the past few years, as EOR 
provides an immediate economic benefit to an oil company (in addition to
 being able to meet its <b>social licence</b> responsibilities).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The natural <b>gas</b> industry has taken on a new challenge of <b>gas</b>
 cleanup of CO2, SO2 (sulphur dioxide) and other contaminants, while 
ensuring that the solvents and the glycols that are used in the cleanup 
process are recycled and reused, and providing a significant cost 
reduction to the customer at the same time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HTC's delta purification 
division is showing promising results, as the energy industry and many 
larger industrial companies have joined the "re3" revolution: reclaim, 
recycle and reuse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tertiary oil 
production business requires a significant amount of water for 
production of steam and, at the same time, a significant capital cost to
 install traditional heavy oil production technologies. Assist Energy 
Solutions Corp.'s SCV technology allows the use of brackish production 
water (that normally would have to be disposed of or treated) to be used
 as steam for energy production. The SCV technology also allows the 
heavy oil producer to bring existing non-producing wells back on-line 
with a minimal investment in capital costs. "Reclaim, recycle and reuse"
 is more than a tag line for the company. The company is a world leader 
delivering technology in this solvent and glycol sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial results</p>

information of HTC is summarized in the attached table. Financial

 31, 2017. The decrease of $249,167 is primarily due to a decrease of 
costs of sales of $102,837, due to nature of services provided versus 
products sold in the prior year, a decrease in commercialization, 
product development and administrative expenses of $148,528, and other 
sundry variances between periods. Decreased costs are mainly due to 
reduced Maxx and Maxx subsidiaries activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Net loss for the period 
was $229,663, compared with a net loss of $476,425 as at March 31, 2017.
 The reduced loss is primarily due to decreased operating expenses and 
increased income from equity investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comprehensive loss for 
the period is $159,086, compared with a comprehensive loss of $613,620 
at March 31, 2017. The loss reduction is attributable to net income and 
the change in unrealized gain on investments classified as available for
 sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total assets for the 
period were $32,009,792, compared with $27,222,061 as at Dec. 31, 2017. 
The increase is attributable to increase in property, plant and 
equipment associated with the development of grain and fertilizer 
handling facility projects as well as the financing received for the 
projects (reflected in the stronger cash position).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Current liabilities were 
$2,420,534 for the period, compared with $1,584,236 as at Dec. 31, 2017.
 The increase is largely due to timing of activity levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long-term debt increased 
from $177,653 in Dec. 31, 2017, to $4,056,672 at the end of the period 
as a result of $4-million in financing received by Maxx Group.</p>

 Minister Justin Trudeau took the stage on Tuesday evening at The Globe 
and Mail Centre in Toronto hours after his government announced a deal 
to acquire the Trans Mountain pipeline, and was introduced as “Canada's 
newest oil baron."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trudeau took the joke in stride, responding that his grandfather owned <b>gas</b>
 stations, so perhaps it's appropriate his government is dropping 
$4.5-billion to take over the controversial energy project from <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Inc</span>.
 If the Prime Minister can duplicate his grandfather's track record, 
taxpayers will do just fine out of the Trans Mountain deal.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Trudeau needs to get his timing right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charles-Émile Trudeau, a lawyer by training, spent the 1920s acquiring <b>gas</b> stations around Montreal, then sold the chain of 30 outlets to <span class="companylink">Imperial Oil</span>
 in 1932 for $1-million - and as they say, that was when a million was 
worth something. That investment formed the base of the family's 
fortune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal Liberals 
bought Trans Mountain to fulfill their commitment to get Alberta oil to 
the British Columbia coast after its Houston-based owner threw in the 
towel on plans to triple the pipeline's capacity in the face of fierce 
political and public resistance, especially in B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government is already trying to find a willing buyer to take Trans Mountain off its hands. Investment bank <span class="companylink">Greenhill &amp; Co</span>.
 has been hired to pitch the project to everyone from pension-fund 
bosses to private-equity investors to pipeline companies. But the timing
 is off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No private company will 
be willing to go near Trans Mountain when the fate of the project 
remains in doubt. As long as environmentalists and other opponents 
believe they can stop the pipeline, its owner will be a political 
target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No chief executive wants 
to associate the corporate brand with scenes of pipeline protesters 
being led away in handcuffs, or deal with endless court challenges from 
B.C.'s NDP government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So for now, the pipeline 
can't be flipped. The challenge for Ottawa - and Bay Street - is 
figuring out how much of the longpromised pipeline expansion must be 
built before the perceived risks begin to drop away and buyers step up 
with attractive offers. Opinions on this are all over the map.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The head of one 
investment bank, speaking anonymously because his firm desperately wants
 to work for a future buyer, told me the Liberals will not get full 
value for Trans Mountain until the project is 100-per-cent done, with 
oil flowing into tankers in Vancouver harbour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His second-in-command, in
 the same conversation, insisted there would be a lineup of buyers at 
30-per-cent complete. This banker said heavyweight U.S. investors such 
as <span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway Inc</span>., which already has significant stakes in Canadian utilities, and <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> would be potential bidders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bankers are also working on plans to help Trans Mountain win an elusive <b>social licence</b> by selling the project to a consortium of public sector pension plans with solid environmental credentials, including the <span class="companylink">British Columbia Investment Management Corp</span>. It's worth noting that the country's biggest fund, the <span class="companylink">Canada Pension Plan Investment Board</span>, said on Tuesday that it is “not actively assessing an investment in the extension opportunity."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That language is telling. The message from CPPIB is: We're not interested now, but call us when the noise dies down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bright minds on Bay Street are also working on solutions to the problems that drove away <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>. If First Nations groups are raising concerns about the pipeline, bring them in as co-owners, as <span class="companylink">Suncor Energy Inc</span>.
 did by partnering with the Fort McKay and Mikisew Cree First Nations on
 a recent $500million investment in an Alberta oil storage facility. 
Canadian banks might be able to provide the financing to make those 
investments possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Infrastructure assets 
such as pipelines, and the dependable cash they kick off, are currently 
hot investments. If Mr. Trudeau can do as his grandfather did and build a
 business that supplies energy to customers who need ever-increasing 
amounts of fuel, Trans Mountain will have no shortage of buyers. But the
 government needs to reduce the risks before those investors emerge.</p>

it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, his

 instead of having the private sector do it, Canadian taxpayers are now 
the owners of the Trans Mountain, for an initial outlay of $4.5 billion,
 with the final cost likely to be around $7.5 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian taxpayers, conscripted by Trudeau, have now assumed all of the risk from Houston-based <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>,
 which halted work on the pipeline last month, threatening to abandon 
the project by May 31, because it was too financially risky to proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This given the court 
challenges to stop the pipeline by B.C. Premier John Horgan's NDP 
government and Indigenous opponents, along with protests by 
environmental radicals who want to kill it at all costs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CEO Steve Kean said the deal is "a great day for Canada" and why wouldn't he? He's now off the hook and we're on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trudeau government 
said it will sell the pipeline back to the private sector once it's 
completed and economically advantageous to do so. Right. We'll see.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, will it even be 
possible, given this precedent, to build any future inter-provincial 
pipelines in Canada without federal ownership, as opposed to the United 
States, where Barack Obama boasted during his presidency that his 
administration had approved enough pipelines to more than encircle the 
earth? This despite Obama's hypocritical veto of the Keystone XL 
pipeline to move Alberta's oil to the U.S. Gulf Coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe, now that U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Donald Trump has lifted that veto, Trudeau will buy it with our money, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why has our 
self-described "green" PM, who used to babble about "phasing out" the 
oilsands, ended up buying a pipeline to ship oilsands oil to British 
Columbia and the world? Because once he was elected in 2015, he was 
confronted by the fact that our economy is losing $15 billion annually 
having to sell almost all of our oil to the U.S. at a huge discount, 
since we have no way to get it to global markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau's purchase of the
 Trans Mountain pipeline project delighted Alberta NDP Premier Rachel 
Notley, who will be contributing $2 billion to the pipeline's costs, if 
needed, from Albertans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What all this shows is 
the abject failure of Trudeau's and Notley's superficial and absurd 
belief that imposing a national carbon price on Canadians would give 
them the "<b>social licence</b>" to build the Trans Mountain pipeline, 
with the blessings of B.C.'s anti-oil government, Indigenous objectors 
and radical environmentalists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exactly none of that has 
happened, the future of the pipeline is still in doubt and billions of 
dollars of taxpayers'money are now at risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bad enough that people 
like hysterical, anti-pipeline protesters, as Robert Bryce explains in 
his book Power Hungry, refuse to accept the inescapable reality that "we
 use hydrocarbons - coal, oil and natural <b>gas</b> - not because we 
like them but because they produce lots of heat energy from small spaces
 at prices we can afford in the quantities that we demand."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's enough clatter 
going on in national and provincial politics to drown out even the 
loudest banter about the royal wedding. Our opposition party leaders in 
both the Ledge and on The Hill are holding government's feet to the fire
 over many thorny issues.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most
 of all it seems that our official oppositions are less than confident 
that the country's leadership and Alberta's most responsible are not 
acting in the best interest of the country and are showing a lack of 
intestinal fortitude dealing with the matter of pipelines. They're also 
challenging the government's carbon levy initiatives as being a burden 
on taxpayers and a disincentive to petro development. I tend to agree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've gone on and on about the folly of pursuing some sort of climate salvation at the expense of our oil, <b>gas</b>
 and coal industries. I still believe the economic benefits of a healthy
 carbon economy will foster the kind of innovations that will reduce 
emissions of real pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The focus on CO 2 is 
misguided in my opinion, and the money spent in reducing that 
concentration could be far better spent mitigating real pollutants and 
preparing for inevitable climate fluctuations that will happen 
regardless of our efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it troubles me when even our right-wing politicians are still hung up on reducing greenhouse <b>gas</b>
 emissions all while criticizing the green lobby for crucifying all 
things carbon. Straddling that fence will only make you sore in places 
you really don't want to be sore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've also gone on at 
length about how I don't care much for U.S. President Donald Trump but 
he's really laid into the green movement, which I think was long past 
due.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Climate issues aside, 
there's a real feeling that our current governments have lost all 
connection with the working folks who pay the taxes that pay government 
salaries. There's a smug arrogance that seems to think that we regular 
folks don't know what we're talking about and that we just have to stand
 back and let the government run with the ball.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, while they're jetting around displaying their <b>social licence</b>, we're being considered a poisonous business regime by some pretty heavy hitters. Chief among them <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>, which just might take their ball and go home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And they just might sue the <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span> for lost opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No worries, says the 
government, there's a lineup of folks willing to step in. This is more 
than I know: Watch for some giant off-shore multi-nationals swooping in 
to plow in pipelines from Alberta in whatever direction they wish. Or 
worse yet, the government might end up owning pipelines. Even worse 
might be some big pension funds or heaven forbid Bombardier owns the 
infrastructure that determines how Alberta's resources get to market. 
All possible scenarios with some spooky strings attached. Although, if 
Bombardier owned the line, there would be no end of government money to 
operate it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm encouraged and 
hopeful the tide might be turning. It's been apparent government is on 
its heels when asked the hard questions. They read from scripted 
responses that often have little to do with the subject and they dare 
not depart from that script. There's a feeling that there's a real lack 
of competency, and the opposition is being tenacious in their efforts to
 reveal that lack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My political stance has 
generated the most critical mail I get. There are still some diehard 
souls who despise all things Conservative who fawn over Alberta's 
socialists and the junior Trudeau. That's the beauty of democracy; you 
can disagree even if you're wrong. Gotta go, I just waded in a little 
too deep.</p>

meant by "the environment" these days, is what the strife in Canada is, 
and has been for quite a while, all about.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever
 it does for the Earth, global warming raises the temperature in 
politics. Take the ardent catastrophist Naomi Klein for instance. Her 
view of it is as the hell mouth to "injustice, racism, intolerance and 
wars," a tidy quartet. On Canada's much abjured <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 pipeline, Klein is only a little less fretful. She speaks of that, 
among other drear indictments, as having the potential to "cook the 
planet." A sense of proportion is clearly not a dominant virtue when 
global warming is your cause. Her views are the views of the movement. 
She is a leading antagonist in the global warming war.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that war the Canadian 
oilsands has been the main front for over a decade. It has been the 
object of the world's environmentalists'most sustained crusade. It will 
not take a Jeopardy sage to guess which national government has been 
most avidly the champion of the cause. The Trudeau government, with its 
acute ambition to be seen as the whitest of the white knights in the 
combat against the Great Warming to come, its patent yearning to be seen
 as a, or the, major player in the great cause, has made the fight 
against what it calls climate change its most public and urgent 
endeavour. Global warming has, for all intents, replaced peacekeeping as
 Canada's bid for global stature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In doing so, it has 
recklessly enriched the atmosphere in which the campaigns against 
Canadian oil are conducted, and equally - until very recent days - has 
been passive to the point of prostration to all the propaganda 
incessantly targeting Canadian jobs and Canadian industry in the 
oilfields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It effectively cancelled 
Energy East, banned future tanker traffic, cancelled Northern Gateway, 
hosted innumerable summits on fighting climate change, instituted a 
national carbon tax, strong-armed Alberta into an illusory deal for "<b>social licence</b>,"
 silently wrote off thousands and thousands of jobs in the process, and 
famously lamented not being able to close down the "carbon economy 
tomorrow." All to earn credits with the internationalist global warming 
consensus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those campaigns for the 
moment meet and are most intense in British Columbia. The one pipeline 
left on the Canadian drawing board now has for years been hectored and 
harassed, subject to protest and serpentine regulation, and dragged to 
near extinction. In fewer than two weeks we will hear whether <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>,
 which has spent one billion dollars merely to extend a pipeline built 
in 1953, has tired of the exercise and, exhausted, simply abandons the 
project out of bottomless frustration. They must really wonder why, with
 so little welcome, and up until their deadline, they faced a federal 
government so committed to a cause whose triumph would be the negation 
of all energy industries, anywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back to getting our act 
together. The federal government is also on the ramparts facing the B.C.
 government, with Finance Minister Bill Morneau levelling a caustic 
fusillade this week at B.C. Premier John Horgan and his green cohorts 
for obstructing the national purpose and "unconstitutionally" seeking to
 override federal authority. The federal government is not quite as hot 
over Saskatchewan's demurral to play into its global warming policy of 
the carbon tax, but it has already singled out Saskatchewan for 
financial penalties, withholding federal funds from that province - a 
tactic it will not deploy, however, against the far more contentious 
B.C. This fuels a legitimate charge that the Trudeau Liberals play the 
game unfairly as between provinces, and thereby manufactures a fresh 
friction within our newly fractious federation. Meantime Quebec, never a
 spectator on this file, is on side with B.C., as it was active in 
killing the Energy East pipeline and therefore actively in contest with 
Alberta, and latently with the Atlantic region. Global warming is not a 
buttress of national unity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the rampage stirred 
up by greenism does not stop there. In Ontario, Kathleen Wynne, in every
 other sense a capable and intelligent leader, by adopting the global 
warming cause and making it an Ontario project, has utterly exhausted 
her popularity. The various results of the woeful "green" efforts - 
waste, artful subsidies to renewables, cancellation of <b>gas</b> 
plants, a forest of overpriced windmills, the dread carbon tax, and 
tumid electricity prices - have blistered her apparently irredeemably 
with the voters, and polls suggest has turned her party into political 
pariahs. The only person truly happy about Ontario's green policies has 
to be Doug Ford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within our Indigenous communities division is rife. Those which signed on to <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 plead to be heard and are either never mentioned in all the volatile 
press on the subject, or vastly overwhelmed by the Indigenous activists,
 who in most reporting on this subject earn the headlines and the lead 
story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Atlantic region 
Newfoundland is waking up to the consideration that its offshore 
industry will probably be the next target of the global warming zealots.
 The Maritimes are waking up, too, that they let pass the cancellation 
of Energy East with reckless unconcern. The economy of the region will 
pay for that indifference, and the current perfect cloud of 32 Liberal 
MPs will pay for it too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trudeau government 
vastly overestimates and overpraises the power of "our example to the 
world." This is quite natural. Every author is the ideal reviewer of his
 own book. But to earn even that dubious international status, look at 
the costs at home. Canada's carbon tax, and its high zeal for the cause,
 cannot, in any substantial way, change the equations of the world's 
atmosphere. We are incidental to the problem, if indeed it is a problem.
 Whatever Canada does, or does not do, will not accelerate the crisis or
 diminish it, in any way that is meaningful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its zeal to be seen as
 champion for a problem we have minimal capacity to cure, this 
government has roiled the Canadian political landscape, stirred a 
current of rage in Alberta, set provinces bitterly at odds with each 
other, shattered the governing party in Ontario, placed useless taxes on
 an already depressed industry, and chased billions of dollars of 
investment money out of the country. Most grievously, it has already 
indicated to the world that Canada is a very inhospitable place for any 
projects large in scale that in any way might wander under the eyes and 
objections of global warming zealots, the politicians who support them, 
and governments that are their willing partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world has indeed 
already taken notice that Canada doesn't have its "act together" and 
Canada has already learned that it is "getting harder and harder to get 
its resources to world markets." It is certainly true of the most 
cardinal resource of global commerce, our oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What a mess playing boy scout on global warming has created in our quiet Dominion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Michael Binnion reports</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTERRE REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2018 RESULTS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questerre Energy Corp</span>. has released its financial and operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, president and chief executive officer of Questerre, 
commented: "Our production and cash flow growth this quarter was 
primarily driven by the increased investment in Kakwa. Production from 
the joint venture acreage almost doubled from the first quarter of 2017.
 With additional drilling scheduled for later this summer at Kakwa, we 
could see production dip in the next few quarters before a further 
increase by year-end."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: "Through a 
recent partnership with an experienced Montney operator, we plan to 
develop our immediately offsetting acreage. We are looking forward to 
the results from the first well given the strong condensate rates and 
low acid <b>gas</b> from our adjacent producing wells."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Highlights:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Average daily production over 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Adjusted funds flow from operations more than doubled to $4.7-million;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Questerre partners with experienced operator to develop Kakwa North acreage;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Questerre commissions integration study for Jordan oil shale project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commenting on Quebec, he 
noted: "We were encouraged by comments this May from the Minister of 
Environment noting that the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources 
will soon be tabling regulations for hydrocarbons. Once finalized, we 
will be meeting with the municipalities to secure the local 
acceptability we need. We are confident there is interest in our clean <b>gas</b> pilot and its environmental and economic benefits."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Updating developments on its project in Jordan, he further added: "During the quarter, we engaged <span class="companylink">Hatch Ltd</span>.,
 a global engineering firm, to review the engineering and economics for 
our oil shale project in Jordan. The initial project will target 
production of approximately 50,000 barrels per day and will include the 
costs to upgrade the produced oil to diesel and gasoline. Once this 
study is completed, we plan to commission a more detailed pre-FEED 
[prefront end engineering design] study as we commence negotiations for a
 concession agreement."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result of the 
increased capital investment in Kakwa last year, the company reported 
higher production volumes over prior periods. Production averaged 2,013 
barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter compared with 1,123 
boe per day for the same period last year with Kakwa accounting for over
 three-quarters of production during both periods. Gross revenue more 
than doubled to $9.54-million with higher production volumes benefiting 
from higher oil prices in the period. The higher revenue contributed to 
adjusted funds flow from operations of $4.65-million for the period 
compared with $1.41-million last year. The company reported net income 
of $60,000 for the current quarter compared with a loss of $520,000 for 
the first quarter last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capital investment for 
the quarter focused almost exclusively on Kakwa and totalled 
$8.66-million (2017: $5.32-million). The company anticipates incremental
 investment at Kakwa in 2018 could be up to $21-million and include six 
(1.5 net) wells subject to the operator's final plans and continued 
results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The term adjusted funds flow from operations is a non-international financial reporting standard measure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questerre Energy</span> is leveraging its 
expertise gained through early exposure to shale and other 
non-conventional reservoirs. The company has base production and 
reserves in the tight oil Bakken/Torquay of southeast Saskatchewan. It 
is bringing on production from its lands in the heart of the 
high-liquids Montney shale fairway. It is a leader on <b>social licence</b> to operate issues for its Utica shale <b>gas</b> discovery in the St. Lawrence Lowlands in Quebec.</p>

 Prime Minister is about to ask taxpayers to bail him out of a 
self-inflicted calamity - the inability to ship our oil to overseas 
markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau promised the $7.4
 billion Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion (TMX) would be built because 
it's the last opportunity to prevent our vast reserves from being 
permanently landlocked. Letting the project die would cause so much 
economic, constitutional and reputational damage that no amount of 
spinning could save his government from grievous political damage. B.C. 
Premier John Horgan declared he will do everything to kill the pipeline.
 Trudeau cannot tolerate a province thwarting the federal government on a
 critical matter within an exclusive federal jurisdiction. He has to 
defend the constitution and rule of law or the very viability of our 
confederation will be undermined.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover,
 Canada's credibility with foreign investors would be tarnished when 
capital is already heading south because of a dramatic reduction in U.S.
 corporate tax rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau's face-saving 
plan mirrors Ronald Reagan's observation: "If it moves, tax it. If it 
keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it." Due to
 B.C. hostility, federal inaction and regulatory overreach, TMX became 
too risky and expensive. Trudeau and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley 
exacerbated the problem when they naively proposed a grand bargain 
doomed to fail - impose a costly carbon tax in exchange for the <b>social licence</b>
 to construct Trans Mountain. Now the Feds, perhaps with the Province of
 Alberta, will write a whopping cheque or provide indemnification to <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> or another private investor, possibly accompanied by support for First Nations' investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most Canadians understand
 our oil must not be stranded. The opportunity cost of this project 
alone is estimated at $74 billion in revenue over 20 years. For a 
country with 10% of global proven reserves not to export its fossil fuel
 would be unconscionable madness. However, Trudeau is caught in an 
exquisite dilemma of his own making. According to a Nanos poll, over 
two-thirds of Canadians support the project, yet two-thirds oppose the 
use of taxpayers dollars to fund it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Prime Minister is responsible for why TMX is the lastgasp opportunity to access tidewater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He rejected the $7.9 billion Northern Gateway pipeline after Enbridge received the go-ahead from the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board (NEB) </span>and the previous Conservative cabinet. Then <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> cancelled the $15.7 billion Energy East pipeline because the <span class="companylink">NEB</span>
 extravagantly expanded the scope of its review to include downstream 
emissions. Since the government didn't overrule its regulator, Trudeau 
cannot hide behind its project-killing policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, the new Impact 
Assessment Act politicized the review process and exacerbated 
uncertainty to such an extent that no private sector sponsor will ever 
propose a major pipeline again unless the legislation is fundamentally 
changed. Think about it. The government of a fabulously oilrich country 
has precluded overseas sales. Ironically, that would harm the 
environment since exporting Canadian crude could replace higher 
greenhouse <b>gas</b> emitting coal and lessen foreign imports arriving by tanker up the Saint Lawrence River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau won't punish 
British Columbians by withholding infrastructure funding or social 
transfers since that would damage his electoral prospects in 18 Liberal 
seats in the Lower Mainland. It would also send a provocative signal 
about federal power to Quebec with its 40 Liberal seats and whose 
moribund sovereigntists are always one perceived outrage away from 
resurgence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau will try to take 
credit for rescuing Trans Mountain. That is like a CEO whose blunders 
drove a company to the brink, but demands a bonus when shareholders are 
forced to inject funds to keep it afloat. The executive should be fired.
 Next year, voters will determine Trudeau's fate.</p>

 leader of Canada’s Conservative Party insists his party would meet the 
Paris climate accord targets, but would not speculate on how it would do
 so. While Andrew Scheer is committed to dumping the federal carbon tax,
 he was mum on how his unfinished climate plan could impact on the oil 
and <b>gas</b> industry, one of Canada’s major greenhouse <b>gas</b> emitters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I am committed to 
ensuring that Canada plays its role [in the Paris accord]; you’ll pardon
 me for not unveiling every aspect or try to tip my hand. We are doing a
 tremendous amount of work to come up with a comprehensive plan on the 
environment,” Scheer said after an appearance at a Calgary Chamber of 
Commerce luncheon on Friday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I
 think there is a lot that can be done through incentives and through 
investments in research and technology, and that's always better than 
imposing a new tax on Canadian families.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a question and answer 
session with Sandip Lalli, president and CEO of the Calgary Chamber, 
Scheer blamed the governing federal Liberals for delays in construction 
of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>’s $7.4-billion Trans 
Mountain pipeline expansion, but said little about how a Conservative 
government would get it built in a more expeditious fashion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was cool on the idea 
of putting taxpayers dollars into the project or calling in the military
 should opposition on the ground attempt to further delay the project. <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> has set a May 31 deadline for the uncertainty around the project to be resolved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I believe very firmly that the issue around <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 is set in the backdrop of several decisions that were taken that 
shattered the confidence in Canada's energy sector,” he said, pointing 
to the cancelations of the Northern Gateway and Energy East pipeline 
proposals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And we have to talk 
about the carbon tax, which is a huge competitive disadvantage. When you
 put all that together, and then we see a provincial government taking 
action, that’s the tipping point for a project proponent. We called on 
Justin Trudeau to have a meeting with Premier [John] Horgan and Premier 
[Rachel] Notley months ago [and] nothing happened. The prime minister 
has the entire department of Natural Resources, the Department of 
Justice, at his disposal to come up with a plan. We are only now 
starting to talk about legislation to entrench and defend the relevant 
sections of the Constitution. We could have been having those debates, 
those conversations, taking those steps, back in January, February, even
 before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What a terrible 
indictment of his handling of this file. I am very disappointed and I 
sense the frustration here in Calgary and here in Alberta. It’s an 
emotional response because it’s their friends and neighbours who have 
been affected by this,” Scheer said. “I think everyone can agree, 
regardless of their political stripes, that the federal government 
investing tax dollars&nbsp;in an energy project is not the optimal 
solution. It’s come to here because of&nbsp;[Trudeau's] failures.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prime minister needs to be working with <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 to provide the confidence and the assurances that “it is not about the 
money, it’s not about taxpayers dollars. It’s about a plan, it’s about a
 timeline that they can work with in getting that project built in that 
timeline. I believe that if that was the focus then the use of 
government funds wouldn't be necessary,” said Scheer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, he said the 
pipeline has become a symbol for a larger issue. “I believe it’s 
essential to take a step back and remember how we got to where we are, 
and why is Trans Mountain the focal point. And it starts with right 
before the election where you have Justin Trudeau undermining the 
credibility of our science-based independent regulatory bodies who have 
for decades approved pipelines based on data and facts, and where there 
were improvements needed, ordered companies to make those improvements, 
and it worked. Canadians had confidence in it, until Justin Trudeau 
politicized it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So now all eyes are on 
Trans Mountain, the hardest of the three to get built because&nbsp;it 
is&nbsp;going right through the heart of the very place where the 
protesters are more prevalent, who have also been emboldened by the 
prime minister saying that they must give permission through <b>social licence</b> before projects can go ahead.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has now devolved into a
 “bizarre situation where we have a private company wanting to use 
shareholders money to build a project that would create jobs and 
economic activity in Canada, and the Liberal response is, well we are 
going to have to subsidize you to get to do that…. It should never have 
come to this. Hopefully we won’t be in the opposition too long and we 
can start to actually use the power of the federal government to get 
these important projects built.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked if he would 
consider bringing in the Canadian military to expedite pipeline 
construction, Scheer said: “I don’t think we have to get to there quite 
honestly. I think that that is something that the left would love to 
conjure up images of. There is a lot of space between here and there…. 
And in many cases it’s actually not the protesters that are the problem,
 it’s the NDP government of British Columbia that is the problem right 
now, and the RCMP and municipal police forces have to enforce the law. 
People don't get to just decide which laws to follow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think it is up to the 
federal government to make sure that the law is followed,” Scheer noted.
 “We have to be a country of laws. We can’t have people who disagree 
with the decision — a duly passed law or a legitimate use of the power 
of the government — we can’t allow these people who disagree with that 
to break the law, they don't have the right to do that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questioned about how the 
provinces are handling the pipeline impasse, Scheer found no fault with 
the Alberta government, but laid blame almost entirely on the federal 
government. “I think Premier Notley is in a tough spot, and whoever was 
premier of Alberta would be in a very difficult position, having to deal
 with British Columbia, but I don't want to focus on what one province 
should or should not [be] doing because my issue is that Justin Trudeau 
has done literally nothing for over a year and he has shown a complete 
lack of leadership and has forced provinces to take matters into their 
own hands, and they shouldn't have to do that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Social licence</b></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scheer also said the meaning of <b>social licence</b>
 has to remain science-based. “It’s funny [how] we have to define this 
now because it has been a term that has kind of been invented by the 
left, but I think fundamentally we have systems in place where experts 
and those that know&nbsp;the issue intimately, because&nbsp;they have 
got the training and they have the scientific credentials, are delegated
 to make decisions for us based on their best observations. And this 
isn't just about the energy sector,” he said. “Whether it’s a planned 
road or an LRT or a subway line, we have to have a decision-making 
process that citizens can have confidence in and then live with the 
decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As long as you have a transparent process based on a non-political approach to these things, then that is where <b>social licence</b> rests.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supercluster initiative</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In regard to innovation, 
Lalli noted, “other countries have been successful around clustering” in
 reference to the federal government’s $1 billion supercluster 
initiative, and asked what a Conservative government would do to promote
 innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s easy for 
governments to spend money and have big announcements,” Scheer said. 
“What is not seen is the cost of spending that billion dollars. And all 
the little decisions that get made for an entire economy because the 
government has made those choices and perhaps not other choices, or 
because they had to collect those taxes and take them out of the economy
 in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And then you have the 
idea that governments somehow can predict where these things are going 
to happen. I think a big fallacy for many politicians, certainly those 
of the Liberals and the NDP, is that there is somehow this giant 
switchboard that manages the economy and we can pull levers and turn 
dials and push buttons and we can grow the economy by having people in 
Ottawa guess and predict and do things better, and I don't agree with 
that at all. I think that the organic nature in which the free market 
works is always, always better than planned economies or decisions being
 made in government offices.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Internal, external trade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scheer said a 
Conservative government would work to ensure free trade among Canadian 
provinces. The current state of internal trade barriers, on items like 
alcohol, which was recently upheld by the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>,
 doesn’t send a good signal when negotiating trade deals with other 
countries. “It weakens our moral position, but also it weakens our 
economic position.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>, Scheer challenged the Trump administration’s sector-by-sector approach. “We have a challenge with <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>
 and the Conservative party has certainly tried to do what we can to 
support the government’s efforts. We have been critical with them here 
at home&nbsp;when we think they have missed opportunities,” he said. 
“But we have spoken with a united front when we go to the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have a particular 
challenge with the Trump administration, and that is, the U.S. 
administration right now is looking at trade along the lines of a 
sector-by-sector surplus or deficit calculation, so instead of looking 
at a trading relationship as a whole and saying, on the whole, what’s 
our trade surplus or deficit, what’s the economic impact, they are 
really drilling down into steel and aluminum and agriculture and 
manufacturing and auto,” and in any one of those sectors, not accepting 
the U.S. having a trade deficit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That's not an 
appropriate way to evaluate a trading relationship because as you know, 
every country does some things well and some things better and relies 
and benefits from another country doing other things well. For example, 
Canada has a massive deficit when it comes to citrus fruit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And as well we want [the
 federal government] to focus on jobs,” he added. “They are bringing a 
lot of social issues to the negotiation table that really don’t speak to
 market access and the jobs that go with that. So we think they should 
stay focused on keeping trade barriers away and improving market access 
for Canadian goods and services.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Productivity</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked what his government
 would do to increase productivity and help small and medium sized 
business to scale up, Scheer pointed to reforms to education to better 
target students to jobs. “One of the things we can do … is link skills 
training with available jobs, and rather than the model that many 
governments use which is to have the bulk of their&nbsp;focus on skills 
training going to other levels of government and then on through, kind 
of following the student.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We could also have 
support that goes to where the job is. So rather than say to a student, 
here is funding and you pick what you would like, part of the solution 
could be saying, OK, here is a training partnership with a company that 
knows that right now or in three or five years, there are going to be 
these types of jobs available, and attract the people to those jobs so 
that students aren't getting qualified or training in areas where there 
aren't jobs available, or where they likely won’t be. In other words, 
allow the market to play more of a role in allocating resources for 
skills training,” he said.</p>

 easy to miss amid the understandable political uproar over Canadian 
pipelines (or perhaps more appropriately, our apparent inability to 
build them) was the <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span> Monthly Merchandise Trade Report in February that tracks Canada's international balance of trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report indicated 
Canada's trade deficit amounted to $2.7 billion, which widened from $1.9
 billion from the prior month, with imports advancing 1.9 per cent 
month-over-month, mostly due to higher purchases of energy products.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hidden
 within those summary numbers was the revelation that imports of energy 
products into Canada advanced by a material 15.4 per cent to $3.4 
billion, the highest level since November 2014, with the largest share 
of those imports originating from the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The importation of crude 
oil and bitumen advanced 15.4 per cent, with imported refined petroleum 
products up by 24.1 per cent, the latter due largely to increased 
imports of gasoline into B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's increased importation of oil and its products reflects a growing trend in the past two years since the <span class="companylink">U.S. Congress</span> ended a 40-year ban on oil exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accompanied by surging 
U.S. production, crude oil exports from the U.S. to Canada (seasonally 
adjusted), have risen from $6.4 billion from September 2015 to February 
2016, to $8.4 billion from September 2017 to February of this year, or 
by about a third.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While these numbers 
fluctuate monthly, the point is that in February, while Canada exported 
$8.8 billion in energy, it also imported $3.38 billion from 
international sources, which, according to <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span>, represents a year-to-year increase of 12.3 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada produces far more 
oil than it can consume, and hence it is the world's fourth largest 
producer and third largest exporter of oil. In 2016, Canada was the 
largest foreign supplier of crude oil to the U.S., with 99 per cent of 
our oil exports directed there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada accounted for 41 per cent of total U.S. crude oil imports and 20 per cent of U.S. refinery crude oil intake. However, <span class="companylink">Natural Resources Canada</span>
 also indicated that in 2016, Canada imported crude oil and equivalents 
from many countries, including the United States (62 per cent), Saudi 
Arabia, Algeria, Nigeria and Norway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when Canadian 
attentions, both public and political, are riveted on our pernicious 
lack of pipeline access to international oil markets, we question why so
 little attention is being paid to Canada's increasing importation of 
petroleum products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It cost Canadians $3.4 
billion in February alone. To be clear, we are not arguing a trade 
surplus or deficit is an appropriate barometer of a country's health. 
However, we do suggest growing U.S. exports, due to deregulation, and 
our inability to build infrastructure to export our energy, is not 
beneficial to Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada could enhance its security of supply, reduce its trade deficit and produce fewer global greenhouse <b>gas</b> emissions if we used more of our Canadian crude oil production. A recent study by the <span class="companylink">Canadian Energy Research Institute</span>,
 using 2016 data, indicates that substituting Canadian oil wherever 
possible using space on existing pipelines, rail cars and ocean tankers,
 could reduce foreign oil imports into Eastern Canada by a whopping 47 
per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This would save 
refineries $210 million and reduce Canadian emissions of carbon dioxide 
by the equivalent of more than two million tonnes, or about 5.7 per cent
 annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute also found 
that eastern Canadian refineries process just over one million barrels 
of oil per day, of which only 39 per cent originates from Western Canada
 and five per cent originates from the eastern Canadian offshore; fully 
56 per cent is imported from the United States (amounting to 260,000 
barrels of imported oil per day).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly, lower regulatory
 and fiscal costs would benefit all Canadians through the more efficient
 utilization of Canadian resources. Hence, we urgently need better 
policies to resolve our pipeline infrastructure problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a precarious B.C. 
government opposes oil pipelines, the Trudeau government's avowed 
transition away from fossil fuels appears perversely to be directed 
solely at penalizing Canadian producers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is overregulating 
domestic producers with misdirected policies that allow foreign 
petroleum imports - unimpeded by Canadian environmental laws, so-called <b>social licence</b>, greenhouse <b>gas</b>
 reduction strategies and associated taxes - to flood into Canada to 
displace jobs and discourage investment. Ron Wallace has served on 
federal, provincial and territorial energy and environmental regulators

 is in the middle of a pipeline crisis because three of the four main 
actors in this drama need a pipeline but don't want one. Meanwhile, the 
fourth actor wants one but doesn't really need it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three politicians in 
this circus - Alberta NDP Premier Rachel Notley, Liberal Prime Minister 
Justin Trudeau and B.C. NDP Premier John Horgan - are all "greenies" and
 would rather <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s Trans Mountain expansion not be built for environmental reasons.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet for one reason or another, all three of them need Trans Mountain (even though Horgan won't admit his need publicly yet).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley and Trudeau want 
Trans Mountain the least. They have drunk the "green" Kool-Aid and truly
 think our atmosphere is going to hell in a pipeline. They are committed
 to the notion that Canada can (and should) end the use of fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only reason Notley and Trudeau are now defending Trans Mountain is that both need it for fiscal and political reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley clings to the hope
 that if she can get a pipeline well underway before next spring's 
provincial election, she will be able to convince enough Alberta voters 
to stop hating her government enough that her NDP can sneak a second 
term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She also knows there is 
no way Alberta's budget will ever be balanced again without the revenues
 associated with at least one pipeline. All the wind turbines and solar 
farms in the country can't replace the revenues from oil and <b>gas</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, Notley bet the house on "<b>social licence</b>"
 - the theory that if Alberta self-inflicted enough economic pain in the
 name of the environment, other provinces and eco-protesters would 
welcome our pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, <b>social licence</b> hasn't worked because it was never going to work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, Notley was 
so confident in her airy-fairy theory that she gave Quebec a veto over 
Energy East: Don't like our climate plan? Don't take our pipeline! So, 
of course, because the Quebec government never wanted the pipeline for 
political reasons, they were only too happy to help kill Energy East by 
insisting the eco plan didn't go far enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So now, for political and budgetary reasons, Notley absolutely must produce a completed Trans Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Notley, Trudeau needs pipeline revenues to rebalance his government's budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And since Trudeau and his
 government created environmental rules that made it impossible for 
other pipelines to go ahead - such as Northern Gateway and Energy East -
 Trudeau's pipeline eggs are now all in <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s basket, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ironically, of the three,
 Horgan is perhaps the most pro-development (or maybe that should be the
 least anti-development). Still, he is forced to be the most vocal 
opponent because the British Columbians most likely to vote NDP are also
 those most against <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>. More
 importantly, his governing coalition is being held in power by three 
Green MLAs who would likely abandon him and force an election if he 
allowed Trans Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But consider this: The Horgan government needs resource revenues, too. And it knows B.C. voters like LNG (liquified natural <b>gas</b>).
 So when it is ready for another election, the B.C. NDP will likely 
approve LNG, triggering the Greens to bring the government down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that brings us to why Horgan could end up needing Trans Mountain as much as Notley and Trudeau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The feds could withhold federal approval of LNG until Horgan permits a pipeline to be built across B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And since Trans Mountain 
is the only pipeline still out there ... Kinder Morgan, of course, is 
the one player that truly wants Trans Mountain. But it has signalled it 
may no longer need it and will walk away. Which is why two of the actors
 who need the pipeline for political reasons are talking about buying 
Trans Mountain They'll use our tax dollars to enhance their political 
fortunes.</p>

 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hosted a confab in Ottawa on Sunday 
between our NDP Premier Rachel Notley and B.C.'s NDP Premier John 
Horgan, the only concrete result was an Ottawa-Alberta alliance to throw
 taxpayer money at a project that wouldn't need subsidies if these three
 governments'environmentalism hadn't scared away all private investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, sure, after the 
meeting Trudeau also promised to introduce legislation soon that would 
"reassert and reinforce" Ottawa's constitutional authority to ensure the
 Trans Mountain expansion project gets built. Whoop-de-do. This is about
 as necessary as the feds passing a law reaffirming their constitutional
 authority over the issuing of coins and currency, the post office, the 
census and "beacons, buoys, lighthouses and Sable Island."</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 key development from Sunday's pipeline summit was the willingness of 
the Trudeau and Notley governments to put our money where their mouths 
are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Notley 
government, this reminds me of their mess-up over their Climate 
Leadership Plan and PPAs (power purchase agreements).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When our NDP brought in their Climate Leadership Plan in 2015, they failed to consider the effect on PPAs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large-scale buyers of 
power had long-term contracts with the provincial electricity balancing 
pool that permitted them to cancel those contracts if the government 
took action that made the contracts unprofitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley's climate plan 
imposed huge new taxes on large-scale emitters. That made the PPAs 
unprofitable, resulting in the cancellation of many. That NDP failure 
cost Alberta taxpayers at least $2 billion, and likely more than $3 
billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now we can see the failure of the Notley NDP's "<b>social licence</b>" experiment to get pipelines built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta NDP have beggared our economy and overburdened our oil and <b>gas</b>
 industry with regulations and taxes, all in the name of convincing 
"green" activists to stop blocking our pipelines. Instead, the NDP's 
drumbeat on climate change, sustainable development and alternate 
energies has merely emboldened activists to hold out longer against new 
pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sunday, we saw clearly
 where this latest NDP failure has led us - to a joint deal with Trudeau
 and his government to pump perhaps billions of tax dollars into saving <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But remember this key 
fact: the Trans Mountain expansion project is economically viable. 
Pipelines are being built elsewhere around the world even at current oil
 prices. Trans Mountain doesn't need subsidies to make it profitable. It
 needs subsidies only because of political failures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However much of our money Trudeau and Notley throw at <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> is being thrown at the project only because both the feds and the province failed politically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their carbon taxes and 
added environmental regulations, their pandering to eco-activists and 
Indigenous politicians hasn't worked. So now we taxpayers are going to 
have to fork over billions to save the Liberals'and New 
Democrats'political skins, as well as to save a pipeline project that 
didn't need help in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the sequel to the NDP and the PPAs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta NDP cling to 
the fainter-than-faint hope that if they can keep Trans Mountain going, 
they might sneak a second term next year. So they are prepared to raid 
the Heritage Fund or run an even larger deficit to hand a couple billion
 dollars they don't have over to <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the federal 
Liberals are worried for the first time that they might not win 
re-election next year. They don't care about winning votes in Alberta, 
but they realize they have to show concrete action on Trans Mountain or 
risk alienating Ontario voters, who actually care about a prosperous 
economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Make no mistake, though, all this is is a subsidy from taxpayers to the shareholders of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> just to save the NDP's and Liberals'political hides.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTTAWA -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will hug just about anyone. But he is about to drop the niceties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's asked B.C. Premier 
John Horgan and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley - NDP leaders both - to 
meet him in Ottawa on Sunday to grapple with what seem like 
irreconcilable differences.</p>

 announced last Sunday it is suspending the Alberta-B.C. Trans Mountain 
pipeline expansion project and setting a May 31 deadline for reassurance
 that its construction can proceed as approved in the face of opposition
 in B.C., where the minority government is vowing to halt it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta is apoplectic and threatens to throttle oil and <b>gas</b> supplies to B.C. residents, promising punitive legislation as early as next week in retaliation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The showdown poses a 
crucial test of Trudeau's national leadership: whether he can fulfil his
 promise to expand economic growth while balancing the concerns of 
Indigenous and environmental opponents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So forget "<b>social licence</b>." Trudeau's got his sparring gloves on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The PM, who once campaigned on a more collaborative approach to federalism, says "the pipeline will get built."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has called on B.C. to stop "obstructing" it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau says he has a 
"broad range of options" - legal, regulatory and financial - to assert 
federal jurisdiction over an interprovincial pipeline expansion that was
 already approved by the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span> and the federal cabinet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So just what is on the table?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government won't 
discuss any "options" under consideration, especially financial aid, 
given concerns about having an impact on the publicly traded <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>. But sources say a plan will be ready before the next cabinet meeting on April 24.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some of the 
choices that a range of experts inside and outside government, most of 
whom agreed to speak only for background, suggested:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Legal and regulatory</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government could 
enact a new bill - call it, say, the Trans-Mountain Act - to clearly 
define and assert federal jurisdiction on the project and hobble the 
B.C. NDP's planned reference to a B.C. court on the question of its 
jurisdiction. The federal government could take over permitting and 
other regulatory approvals for the project. It could clarify its own 
powers and add other burdens or outline penalties for the province if it
 tries to stand in the way of the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa could withhold 
discretionary funds from B.C. such as spending on regional economic 
diversification, innovation or other monies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government 
could, counterintuitively, require further environmental controls on the
 project, say double-walled pipelines or increased marine protections to
 further address Indigenous and environmental concerns - beyond the 
$1.5-billion oceans protection plan it already promised to address the 
previous B.C. Liberal government's concerns - in exchange for some kind 
of guarantee the B.C. government would cease its opposition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In theory, Ottawa could 
disallow a B.C. law or regulation that it declares as contrary to the 
national interest, but that kind of sledgehammer hasn't been used since 
the 1940s, and legal experts say convention suggests it should not be 
used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa could, however, 
invoke federal emergency powers to deal with protests if they were to 
block construction. However the RCMP already has lawful powers to 
enforce a B.C. court-ordered injunction against protests within five 
metres of two work sites, and last month arrested dozens of protesters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal sources dismiss 
talk of calling in the military. "None of this uncertainty is about 
protests," said one official. Rather, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s
 uncertainty centres on B.C.'s vow to put legal hurdles in the way of 
the project. "It's making investors skittish," the official said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finance Minister Bill 
Morneau said the government is looking to "de-risk the project so that 
it goes forward." In plain language, that means underwrite or assume 
some of the project's risk in some way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Tim McMillan, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum 
Producers, said "there are a 1,000 permutations" of what financial 
backstop could look like. Others inside government agree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government 
and/or the Alberta government could buy a partial or even a controlling 
stake (a highly unlikely, but not off-the-table option) in a project 
that is 30 per cent held by <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada Limited</span> and 70 per cent owned by Texas-based <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan, Inc</span>., one of North America's largest pipeline operators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upside: it would 
assure investors Canada is prepared to put its money where its mouth is 
to push the project through. The downside: the prospect of Justin 
Trudeau buying into an oilsands pipeline company would surely run 
counter to his stance on climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa could provide some
 kind of financial guarantee to backstop or insure any part of the 
project, such as construction costs, on a look-back or a go-forward 
basis - a kind of insurance policy for the $1.1-billion <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 has already spent or against future spending on a project estimated to 
cost $7.4 billion. Right now, because the project is not 
full-steam-ahead, construction costs are estimated at about $20 million a
 month, but if the green light is given to start large-scale 
construction, that is expected to run as high as $200 million to $300 
million a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa's options could 
include a loan guarantee. It could loan money and collect interest or 
forgo interest in exchange for equity knowing the return on the 
investment is secure. <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> has
 secured commitments from 13 of Western Canada's largest oil producers 
that they will ship heavy and light crude through the pipeline once its 
capacity is tripled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> won't say publicly what 
action it wants Ottawa to take, or whether it even wants the government 
to take an equity stake. The company won't comment on Sunday's summit in
 Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement to the Star, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 said it will continue to consult "with various stakeholders" to see if 
an agreement can be reached by June. "The focus in those consultations 
will be on two principles: clarity on the path forward, particularly 
with respect to the ability to construct through B.C.; and, adequate 
protection of KML shareholders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be clear, Ottawa has already narrowed the range of "options" it is prepared to take.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morneau dismissed outright B.C.'s request that Ottawa ask the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>
 to decide whether the province has any environmental or marine 
protection jurisdiction that would allow it to put new controls on oil 
flows in the proposed expansion of the Alberta-B. C. pipeline, in the 
name of defending B.C.'s coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't see a need to refer something to the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>
 when we already know that it's a federal jurisdiction," said the 
finance minister. "That from our standpoint is not a course of action 
that makes sense."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span> reference wouldn't solve anything by May 31 in any case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And for Justin Trudeau to
 claim success, let alone carry the banner of being a different kind of 
national leader - different than the polarizing figure that his father 
was - the answer would seem to lie in a political agreement to resolve 
differences, in the spirit of co-operative federalism, not in a 
judicially imposed resolution.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the nation mourning 
Humboldt's loss, pecking out an obstinate tweet about an oil pipeline 
buried in political grief wasn't at the top of Justin Trudeau's to-do 
list. Yet the prime minister tweeted it out before joining members of 
the shattered prairie community for last Sunday's vigil.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome
 to government, where events never pause and most days are an endless 
series of bad and worse choices. Trudeau is certainly down to bad and 
worse on the question of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s crown jewel, which happens to double as his fig-leaf on oil and <b>gas</b> policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau the green 
carbontaxer might really, really (really) want this singular pipeline 
built, but if the company building it is now wavering, and the Green 
party dependent NDP premier of the province through which it must pass 
hasn't yet found a body he won't chuck in front of it, at what point do 
you call a spade no spade and concede the Earth will not be moving? 
Perhaps fearing for its economic and constitutional credibility, the 
answer from Team Trudeau is a ringing "not now, not ever."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are determined to see
 (Trans Mountain) built," Trudeau has told reporters. "It is in the 
national interest. It doesn't make any sense for us to continue to have a
 $15-billion discount on our oil resources because we are trapped with 
an American market. We need to get our resources to new markets." 
Indeed. The same words could have - and did - come out of Stephen 
Harper's mouth. Trudeau now has to bell the cat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't meant to be this way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harper's confrontational 
"cramthem-down-your-throats" pipeline policy was to be replaced with 
Trudeau's more charismatic approach that would accrue the "<b>social licence</b>"
 needed to grease construction, a canard that happens to be, despite the
 environmental hysteria, the only fauna killed to date along the 
pipeline's route.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To frame the debate as proeconomy versus pro-environment is to miss the point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Trans Mountain 
ultimately proves is the past 20 years of debate in Canada has split 
people into two irreconcilable camps: pro-oil and anti-oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preening at climate 
summits and taxing carbon won't make exporting oil kosher to those who 
are resolutely opposed. Over their dead bodies is the message being 
passed to Trudeau at the minute. It's not a question of law, it's a 
matter of will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Giddy though the 
opposition parties might be, now is not the time for them to revel in 
Trudeau's mire. Seeing your opponent hoist with his own petard is 
satisfying, but if the pipeline really is in Canada's national interest -
 and it is - the opposition should offer some constructive suggestions 
along with any withering scorn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the rather shouty and petty state of modern politics, this won't happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The partisan urge to 
nannynanny-boo-boo is too strong and besides, Conservatives will say, 
the Liberals didn't exactly lift a finger of support in opposition 
before assuming office and turning the matter into a constitutional 
crisis. Further disincentivizing bipartisan efforts is the Trudeau 
carbon tax, a big part of the government's <b>social licence</b> play that is not particularly well-read by any capital-C Conservative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here, Trudeau shoulders a
 good chunk of the blame. For all his talk of kumbaya, Trudeau's Pan 
Canadian Framework for Clean Energy and Climate Change - with its plan 
for carbon "pricing" - was effectively crammed down provincial throats. 
And with Rachel Notley and Kathleen Wynne's governments now in severe 
financial distress, voters there and across Canada will surely begin to 
wonder why the hell they're on the road to higher taxes if those uppity 
British Columbians aren't holding up their end of the <b>social-licence</b> bargain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is where federal NDP
 leader Jagmeet Singh should have a useful intervention to make, given 
it's his provincial brethren on opposite sides of the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 dispute. But to hope for substance from Singh is to wish for unicorns. 
Singh has done the easy thing and sided with B.C. and its brighter 
federal electoral prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where does this leave Trans Mountain? Shorn of friends and solutions, but all is not yet lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government can, and should, re-assert its constitutional right to build the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yes, the feds can join Alberta in slapping down money and insurance guarantees. But that's only half the battle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the communities along 
the pipeline route remain ready to obstruct its construction it's going 
to take a lot more than bucks and words to clear the way. Even the stern
 words of a judge urging protesters out of the way might not do the 
trick. What then? Do the sunny ways of Trudeau the son even allow for a 
hint of the army steel flashed by his father? Do we just ... watch him?

 investors spooked by the uncertainty plaguing the planned Trans 
Mountain pipeline expansion, Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr said 
Friday as a high-level, make-or-break meeting loomed on the horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government is still 
examining its options, Carr said, but won't commit to a course of action
 before Sunday, when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau jets home from Peru 
for a hastily organized meeting in Ottawa with British Columbia Premier 
John Horgan and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What
 we're now faced with is to find ways to make sure there is more 
certainty than there is now," Carr said in an interview with the <span class="companylink">Canadian Press</span>.
 "One of the ways to make sure there is more certainty is to look at 
possible financial arrangements that would help de-risk the project."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pipeline builder Kinder 
Morgan has halted all non-essential spending on the project until it 
gets assurances from Ottawa that the issues will be resolved. The 
federal government has until May 31 to respond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau has put a lot of 
political eggs in the Trans Mountain basket, risking political capital 
among climate-change activists in search of middle ground that allows 
for pipeline construction alongside improved <span class="companylink">environmental safeguards</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau, who is currently
 in Peru for the Summit of the Americas, was originally supposed to fly 
to Paris directly from Lima on Sunday for meetings with French President
 Emmanuel Macron. Instead, he'll be back in the national capital in 
search of a resolution to an intractable - and politically perilous - 
dispute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carr refused to discuss 
the specific financial options available, other than to say there are 
many of them on the table and they're all being considered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of those options, 
however, is to buy a stake in the pipeline, something Notley has already
 said Alberta would be willing to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada and Alberta could jointly buy the pipeline outright, or at least a significant stake in the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another option is to 
provide a guaranteed source of revenue for private investors if the 
pipeline completion date misses the target for when returns on their 
investments were supposed to start flowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company had targeted 
May 31 as the make-or-break deadline to start construction if the 
pipeline was to hit those investment targets. That date is now the 
drop-dead date <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> has given Canada to prove the company should have the confidence to move forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Political strategist 
Robin Sears, a principal at Earnscliffe Strategy Group, said another 
option would be to increase spending on the environmental protection 
side, including on improved research into preventing and mitigating the 
impacts of a diluted bitumen spill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The company has not done
 what it needs to have done to satisfy the people of B.C. they have 
taken the steps necessary to protect the environment," said <span class="companylink">Sears</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sears said the Trudeau 
government has an oceans-protection plan on paper, but hasn't done much 
if anything to put it into action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carr was only prepared to
 say Sunday's meeting between Trudeau and the premiers would be a chance
 for the various sides to share their positions and try to talk things 
out - not necessarily a day when further action would be announced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, said <span class="companylink">Sears</span>, would be a bad political move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If they come out of that
 meeting on Sunday and [Trudeau] says, 'We've made good progress and I'm
 off to Paris,'it will cost them severely," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">University of British 
Columbia politics professor Kathryn Harrison said she doesn't know that 
there is a way for everyone to come out of Sunday's meeting with a win. 
"They have drawn lines in the sand that are simply incompatible," said 
Harrison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau and Carr have 
spent more than two years accusing the former Conservative government of
 themselves failing to build pipelines because they stacked the deck 
against environmental concerns, failing in the process to get the <b>social licence</b> necessary to allow the projects to proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals introduced new review processes that accounted for things like the potential greenhouse <b>gas</b> emissions resulting from increased oil flows. The <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>'s 2016 approval of Trans Mountain required monitoring and upstream emissions offsets related to construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But environmental 
concerns remain - including the risk of higher emissions from increased 
oilsands production and the environmental impact of a spill. As a 
result, environmentalists who helped get Trudeau elected are now 
doubting his commitment to the cause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harrison said Trudeau has
 staked a claim on being able to reconcile both interests, offering up 
the pipeline - and the resulting ability to get resources to market - as
 a quid pro quo to get provincial and stakeholder support for a carbon 
price and environmental investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That was the compromise 
and they got pretty far with it," Harrison said, noting all provinces 
but Saskatchewan signed onto the climate-change framework.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're at that point now 
where the trains are colliding. This is a moment of truth for Canada and
 a country that relies heavily on producing fossil fuels."</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 mess Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has made of the Kinder Morgan Trans 
Mountain pipeline dispute in British Columbia is the result of his Peter
 Pan Syndrome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the phrase 
coined by American psychologist Dan Kiley in his 1983 international 
bestseller of the same name, referring to childlike men who refuse to 
grow up and accept adult responsibilities.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This describes Trudeau's childlike approach to Canada's vital energy sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We saw it in his absurd suggestions during the 2015 election campaign that Alberta's oil sands, and Canada's entire oil and <b>gas</b> industry, were nothing more than temporary evils.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That Canada under Trudeau
 world earn the world's praise by painlessly transitioning our 
resourcebased economy to green energy, laughing all the way to the bank 
in the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such foolish boasts were examples of Peter Pan Syndrome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were best summed up 
in 2012 by Trudeau's good friend and current top political advisor, 
Gerald Butts, who said as the then head of the <span class="companylink">World Wildlife Fund Canada</span>: "We don't think there ought to be a carbon-based energy industry by the middle of this century."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suggesting Canada should 
abandon fossil fuels by 2050 revealed a staggering misunderstanding of 
Canadian and global energy needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy that can't be 
supplied by wind turbines and solar panels because, unlike fossil fuels,
 the power they provide is intermittent. It can't be stored for use when
 needed, nor is it economically feasible, given current technologies, 
without massive subsidies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bitter fruit of 
Trudeau's half-baked ideas about energy are seen today as the PM heads 
off for Peru while his cabinet ministers run away from reporters asking 
what the federal government plans to do to get the stalled Trans 
Mountain pipeline built, a project it says it supports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They resemble deer frozen in the headlights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're caught between 
Trudeau's election pandering to anti-pipeline protesters in B.C. and 
across Canada, and the reality our energy sector provides hundreds of 
thousands of jobs across the country, although not for much longer if we
 can't get our landlocked oil and <b>gas</b> resources to global markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As things stand, B.C.'s 
NDP Premier John Horgan vows to stop Alberta from shipping its oil to 
the Pacific coast through the Trans Mountain pipeline for export, while 
Alberta's NDP Premier Rachel Notley threatens financial retaliation 
against B.C. and urges Trudeau to do the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Texas-based Kimber 
Morgan, tired of procedural delays on its $7.4-billion project, has 
suspended none-essential work on its pipeline with a deadline of May 31 
to resolve the impasse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, federal 
Environment Minister Catherine McKenna assures Canadians the billions of
 dollars we're paying under Trudeau's national carbon pricing scheme - 
which was supposed to give him the "<b>social licence</b>" to approve pipelines - will achieve our United Nations commitments to meet our industrial greenhouse <b>gas</b> emission reduction targets in 2030. Except anyone who can add thinks that's impossible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this while federal 
Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr assures Canadians the Trudeau 
government is considering all options to get the stalled <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline going, while refusing to discuss them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They include everything 
from a constitutional challenge of B.C.'s delaying tactics, to a Supreme
 Court reference, to paying B.C. to withdraw its objections, to Ottawa 
and Alberta investing in the pipeline to reassure investors, to sending 
in the army to remove protesters.</p>

 a Canadian prime minister is stuck in Neverland and refuses to grow up.

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Milke is the author of multiple studies on the economics of subsidies to business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the great myths 
circulated by the anti-energy crowd in Canada is that the energy sector 
is heavily subsidized by taxpayers. Instead, as I found in my 2017 study
 for the <span class="companylink">Canadian Taxpayers Federation</span>,
 and as economist and taxation expert Jack Mintz has long argued, the 
claims are inflated based on a misuse of tax expenditure data.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But
 if such taxpayer subsidies are rarer than reflexive energy critics 
assert, it turns out that Alberta Premier Rachel Notley and Alberta 
Opposition Leader Jason Kenney are about to give succour to the critics’
 accusations. Over the weekend, both said the Alberta government should 
take a financial stake in <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>, the company facing continual problems in twinning its Trans Mountain pipeline from Alberta to its terminus in Burnaby, B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, Ms. Notley said, 
“If we have to, Alberta is prepared to do whatever it takes to get this 
pipeline built,” and that included that “Alberta is prepared to be an 
investor” in the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> project.
 On Tuesday, she went a step further and declared she would consider 
buying the pipeline outright. Meanwhile, Mr. Kenney argued that while he
 was “philosophically opposed to corporate welfare,” that a “major 
market failure” had occurred. That, he said, justified an equity stake 
“to ensure economic progress.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let’s dissect both 
positions, but start with Mr. Kenney. There is no “major market 
failure.” Instead, there has been major government interference for more
 than a decade in getting Canada’s natural resources – oil, in this case
 – to markets. In the case of British Columbia, consider former premier 
Christy Clark’s 2012 “five conditions” if any new pipelines were to be 
constructed across B.C (this, as if the province was not subject to 
free-trading requirements in Section 92A(2) of the Constitution).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major government 
interference of course continues under the B.C.’s NDP government and the
 City of Burnaby. They are helped along by their anti-resource 
development activist allies on the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lastly, the federal 
government (and despite Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s and Natural 
Resources Minister Jim Carr’s protestations to the contrary) is of 
little help in getting the pipeline built. It is an open secret in 
Calgary that the Trudeau government’s multiple, extra regulatory burdens
 now being imposed on the energy sector mean that even if Trans Mountain
 is built, it will be the last pipeline project, ever. Multiple and 
multiplying regulatory government thickets are the reason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back to equity stakes: In
 addition to why corporate welfare is always a bad deal for taxpayers 
and a risk even when offered through equity, which often turns into a 
loss, an Alberta government financial stake in <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> would change none of the above dynamics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I’ve never believed Ms. 
Notley was serious in her tactics to force the B.C. government to 
reverse course on its anti-oil position. It is the same with her latest 
threats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, if Alberta’s 
leading politicians want to force the matter, and in a way that has 
impact, here are three immodest proposals: First, Ms. Notley should 
introduce legislation that signals her government will repeal the 
Alberta carbon tax. Absent any B.C. government backdown on the pipeline,
 and actual federal efforts to the same end, it is overdue to end the 
charade that Alberta’s carbon tax has enabled so-called <b>social licence</b>. It has not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, Ms. Notley should
 show up in British Columbia and endorse pro-pipeline B.C. Liberal and 
Skeena MLA Ellis Ross, the opposition critic for Natural <b>Gas</b> and 
Petroleum Resources. Political support for Mr. Ross, a former chief 
councillor for the Haisla Nation, would also force the B.C. government 
to go on the defensive vis-à-vis pro-energy First Nations. Ms. Notley’s 
political endorsement of Mr. Ross and betrayal of her same-party 
colleagues in Victoria is the only way to get their attention in a 
substantive way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last, the federal 
government – which likes carbon taxes and claims the authority to impose
 them on provinces, but also claims it wants Trans Mountain to proceed –
 could demonstrate its fealty to both propositions with a simple 
measure: Add $1 a litre to gasoline prices in British Columbia. One 
suspects $2.50 a litre for gasoline in greater Vancouver and nearly 
similar prices elsewhere in British Columbia would focus minds and 
finally provoke a reaction, and perhaps a B.C. government retreat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike an inadvisable equity stake in <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>,
 those three measures would constitute a serious and necessary 
escalation in this dispute. Anything else by politicians in Alberta or 
Ottawa would be useless theatrics.</p>

 decision to pause its Trans Mountain expansion project? Well, if you're
 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the answer is spending $280,000 in 
taxpayers'money for a study to tell you why oil investors are backing 
away from Canada. And if you're Alberta Premier Rachel Notley, the 
answer is demanding that Ottawa give a bailout to oilfield workers while
 your government maybe spends billions it doesn't have investing in 
Trans Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If anything, the 
developments in the last two days prove that not one of the major 
governments involved in the pipeline debate has any clue how jobs are 
created. And not one of the three - the federal Liberals, the Alberta 
NDP and the B.C. NDP - really, truly wants <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> to go ahead. Oh, sure, Premier Notley is doing her finest impersonation of a pro-pipeline politician.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her political future depends on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the energy sector and
 energy workers don't need bailouts and government investment. They need
 our NDP to eliminate its carbon tax, roll back the environmental 
regulations they have introduced and restore the Alberta Advantage. 
Energy-based economies in most of the rest of the world are growing 
strongly without bailouts and government investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Texas and Oklahoma, 
for instance, unemployment is under 4.0 per cent. In North Dakota, it's 
under 3.0. Because there, state governments don't have NDP-like Climate 
Leadership plans that have burdened their energy sectors with billions 
of added taxes and regulations in an effort to buy "<b>social licence</b>."
 The only oil economies that are floundering are those, like Alberta and
 Venezuela, run by lefty governments who think government intervention 
and public spending will spur growth as surely as private innovation and
 investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fastest way to get 
Alberta's economy moving would be for Ottawa, the Alberta NDP and the 
B.C. government of NDP Premier John Horgan to end their obstructionism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And until they do, it's 
doubtful that any amount of federal subsidy or Alberta provincial 
spending can make Trans Mountain go ahead. If the Trudeau government 
ended its new gender-based, Indigenous and ultra-eco assessments of 
energy projects, if it lifted its moratorium on West Coast tanker 
traffic and came out forcefully against B.C.'s delaying tactics and 
against loudmouthed eco-activists, Trans Mountain and other pipelines 
would proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Alberta NDP 
repealed their carbon tax and cancelled their hard cap on oilsands 
emissions and if the B.C. NDP stopped blocking the pipeline at every 
step, Trans Mountain would go ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s decision is not economic, just as <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s
 decision on Energy East last fall was caused by federal and Quebec 
politics, not the world price of oil. In a conference call with 
investors on Monday morning, Kinder Morgan CEO Steve Kean said something
 that should give Notley, Trudeau and Horgan great pause (but which all 
three will probably ignore).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kean said his company is considering investments in other pipelines elsewhere, just not in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the sticking point is 
not energy economics - those are pretty good again. The hold up is 
Canadian politics. That should chill Canadians to the bone across the 
country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our country has the third
 largest reserves of oil in the world. Yet we are in danger of being 
left behind in an investment ditch because our "green" federal and 
provincial leaders are clambering over one another to be climate change 
Boy Scouts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National economic policy is being determined by the ideas of radicals and environmental groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The international market for oil, bitumen and natural <b>gas</b> is strong enough to justify Trans Mountain AND Energy East AND Keystone XL, and maybe even Northern Gateway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is standing in the way of all of them are "progressive" politicians.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the annual meeting 
Friday of the intermediate oilsands producer, CEO Rob Broen faced 
several questions from shareholders, but few about the company's 
day-to-day operations.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead,
 the audience wanted to know about oil pipelines. They asked about 
Ottawa's new review process for major energy projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And they wanted to know about the general state of the sector's competitiveness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If political leaders had a
 chance to listen in, they would have caught a glimpse into the nervous 
psyche of the industry and its investors today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These pipelines need to 
be built ... we need leadership at a federal level to make sure that 
happens," the CEO said in response to one question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Near as aI can tell, we 
have a tax - we have a carbon tax - but we don't have a pipeline and the
 opponents of those pipelines are more entrenched than they've ever 
been.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So the tax hasn't 
helped." Broen isn't the only oilpatch executive voicing concern about 
the industry's future in the face of complex challenges, such as rising 
production in the United States, the differential facing Canadian heavy 
crude and shifting government policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he quickly became one of the more vocal ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with federal 
approval of the Trans Mountain expansion, patience with slow progress on
 pipelines is wearing thin, although it's not entirely clear what more 
the prime minister can do to help propel these projects along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I would tell him he has 
to show leadership on the pipeline file and it's not just words," Broen 
said when asked what message he would give Trudeau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He needs to see it 
through to construction and make sure we can see shovels in the ground 
and get it built, for the benefit of all Canadians."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such comments underscore the dilemma facing the federal government today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau can repeat over 
and over until he's blue in the face that the project to the west coast 
will get built. But other pipelines, like Energy East, have failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until all of the court 
challenges are cleared, the protesters in Burnaby go home and Trans 
Mountain is finished - now slated for late 2020 - the industry's 
collective anxiety won't abate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Fort McMurray, Trudeau
 toured Suncor Energy's Fort Hills oilsands project and later met with 
leaders of the largest petroleum producers in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suncor CEO Steve Williams
 said he was encouraged after speaking with the prime minister about 
issues such as market access, competitive pressures facing the sector 
and changes to the regulatory system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think we're going to get some help," Williams told reporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau reiterated his support for <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 and spoke about the "terrible price differential that is sucking $15 
billion out of the Alberta oil industry because we're not getting global
 prices" for Canadian crude.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he linked the federal
 government's national price on carbon and increased spending on marine 
safety to his cabinet granting approval to Trans Mountain and Enbridge's
 Line 3 replacement project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pieces all fit 
together. If one link in the chain falls apart, however, it threatens to
 pull down the entire national climate plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are folks out 
there who really like the idea that we're approving the pipelines ... 
but aren't too sure about the carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are other people 
across the Rockies who really like the idea we're moving forward on 
climate change and bringing in a national price on carbon, but aren't 
too sure about moving forward on a pipeline," he told reporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are standing up for Canadians'interests, as well as getting the <b>social licence</b> to get our resources to market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, it's not only 
pipelines causing heartburn in the oil industry. Leaders are also 
worried about the flight of capital out of the Canadian sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa now appears to be interested in examining the factors reducing investment in the oilpatch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this week, <span class="companylink">Natural Resources Canada</span> posted a tender for a $275,000 contract, looking for experts to evaluate the competitiveness of the upstream oil and <b>gas</b> sector and examine "recent regulatory changes and major market investment drivers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conducting the report 
suggests there is a willingness by Ottawa to take action, although 
Trudeau himself cautioned Canada "shouldn't be part of a race to the 
bottom."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After meeting with the 
oilsands executives Friday, Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr said the
 issue of industry competitiveness was raised by the CEOs during their 
hour-long session.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have to take very 
seriously what we are hearing from those who are in daily contact with 
investors," Carr said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We also have to keep a view of Canada's long-term competitive advantage."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the promise to build new pipelines, these are positive indicators, although there's no firm action yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The laundry list of concerns strikes to the fundamental issue for Canada's oil and <b>gas</b>
 sector today: Does the federal government really want to see the 
industry thrive and grow into the future? If so, what's it prepared to 
do to see that happen? Political tours, new reports and promises of 
support are welcomed, but there needs to be more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need to see an 
environment where this industry is supported," Broen concluded. Chris

Mr. Michael Binnion reports</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTERRE ENGAGES HATCH FOR ENGINEERING ON JORDAN OIL SHALE PROJECT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questerre Energy Corp</span>. has commented on the progress of the internal feasibility study for its oil shale project in Jordan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has recently engaged <span class="companylink">Hatch Ltd</span>.,
 a global engineering firm, to integrate and support its internal work 
on the technical and economic feasibility of this project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, president and chief executive officer, commented: "This
 is an important milestone. Our preliminary feasibility work has been 
completed. It has not identified any red flags or unexpected technical 
challenges. It also suggests this project could be economic at today's 
oil prices. We are looking forward to the results of the Hatch 
integration study later this summer to endorse our internal work."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commenting on next steps,
 Mr. Binnion added: "Depending on the results of this integration study,
 we would move to pre-FEED [prefront-end engineering design] 
engineering. These results and the subsequent pre-FEED and FEED 
engineering will form part of the proposed work program for the 
predevelopment phase of a future concession agreement with the Jordanian
 government."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, the 
company completed a review of the last of its nine studies covering all 
four aspects of the production of crude oil from its project in Jordan. 
These include mining and feed preparation, retorting, power, including 
utilities and infrastructure, and marketing and refining. The studies 
were completed by independent engineering firms, including Hatch, to 
develop technical and cost-effective solutions for these processes. Due 
to the size of the existing Jordanian refining infrastructure and the 
market for crude products in Jordan, the company has included the costs 
to upgrade the produced crude oil to finished products, including 
gasoline and diesel. Hatch completed four of the nine studies and will 
integrate all the studies into an independent assessment. The design 
basis for this assessment will be an initial project capable of 
sustaining production of 50,000 barrels per day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The feasibility study 
follows the assessment of the oil shale resource completed by an 
independent qualified resource evaluator, Millcreek Mining Group, in 
accordance with National Instrument 51-101 (Standards of Disclosure for 
Oil and <b>Gas</b> Activities) of the Canadian Securities Administrators and the Canadian oil and <b>gas</b>
 evaluation handbook. The resource assessment estimates a best estimate 
of discovered petroleum initially in place (DPIIP) of between 7.8 
billion and 12.2 billion barrels. The resource assessment was prepared 
in accordance with NI 51-101 and the COGE handbook with an effective 
date of Oct. 1, 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DPIIP was the most 
specific assignable category of resources at the time of the resource 
assessment given the preliminary nature of the resource assessment and 
the nature of recovery of the hydrocarbons by means of mining and 
retorting and given that a program of work to determine commercial 
viability using established technology had not yet been completed. In 
addition, as a result of the preliminary nature of the resource 
assessment, it did not contain any estimates regarding the timing or 
cost to obtain commercial development. The accuracy of resource 
estimates is, in part, a function of the quality and quantity of 
available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and 
judgment. Given the data available at the time, the resource assessment 
was prepared, and the estimates presented therein are considered 
reasonable. The availability of additional data and analysis, after the 
date of the estimates, may necessitate revisions. These revisions may be
 material. There is no certainty that any portion of the resources will 
be discovered. If discovered, there is no certainty that it will be 
commercially viable to produce any portion of the resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more information, 
including without limitation a description of the Jordan oil shale 
project, the low and high estimates, and the significant positive and 
negative factors in respect of the resource estimates, please see the 
company's press release dated Oct. 27, 2016, and its annual information 
forms available on the company's website and at SEDAR.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if we get only the 
oilsands concession and no change in proposed pipeline legislation, just
 what has the Alberta government achieved? We'll be able to mine bitumen
 and pump oil to our heart's content, but we won't be able to ship it 
anywhere, except (expensively and inefficiently) by rail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, lawyers 
studying Ottawa's new requirement that all future pipelines be subjected
 to a "genderbased analysis" confess to being confused by just how such 
an analysis would work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just how does "the 
intersection of sex and gender with other identity factors" impact 
pipelines? And, more importantly, how are pipeline companies supposed to
 prove to federal regulators that they have satisfied the gender-based 
tests? Pipeline builders already spend hundreds of millions surveying 
the impact of their projects on people, communities, water, animals, 
plants, even insects - yes, insects - along their proposed routes. But 
now federal approval might hinge on whether construction camps have 
enough female and "gender-diverse" workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if activists tell 
federal regulators they are worried the temporary presence of so many 
male workers will lead to more violence against local women or might 
increase the income gap between the sexes, that might prevent approval, 
too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trudeau government 
isn't backing away, either, from its insistence that Indigenous 
"traditional knowledge" be given equal standing with scientific research
 during the approval process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor is it weakening its 
requirement that pipeline companies account for all the upstream and 
downstream emissions of the products they carry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With all these new 
federal obstacles to pipelines - gender, Indigenous and environmental - 
it will be amazing if any company steps forward to risk billions on a 
new line from Alberta to anywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than jump through 
one federal regulatory hoop after another (with more hoops being added 
all the time), energy companies will simply pass Canada by. They will go
 the States and to countries such as Bahrain, Kazakhstan and Egypt, 
where the oil may be less plentiful, but where the governments are not 
run by Alice in Wonderland eco-zealots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, Canada has dropped to the lower half of countries in the world in which to invest in oil and <b>gas</b>, and the rumoured new federal oil sands exemption will do nothing to improve that.</p>

 Alberta New Democrats'propaganda machine normally spits out about six 
to 10 grant announcements a week. But ever since last week's provincial 
budget, it has been in hyperdrive. Now it feels as if there are six or 
10 announcements a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Usually, this consists of
 a press release stating that the Northwest Central Yellowhead Business 
Development Office has received money for solar panels on its office 
roof, followed by NDP claims that this will help put back to work all 
those thousands of residents who have lost their jobs.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this week, the magnitude and frequency of the spending news has been amped up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new school here (and 
there and there and there and there). A grant for energy-intensive 
businesses (to help pay for damage done by the NDP carbon tax). Money to
 clean the carpets and have yesteryear's flocked wallpaper replaced at 
the Northern and Southern Jubilee Auditoriums. A parkand-ride for St. 
Albert's transit commuters. A billion and a half for Edmonton transit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You may have noticed, 
too, that Premier Rachel Notley has been traipsing across the province 
throwing millions, hundreds of millions and billions around as if they 
weren't hers. (Oh, right. They aren't hers.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lots of people have 
wondered if this postbudget self-congratulations frenzy is a last-ditch 
effort by the New Dems to win re-election next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't think so. There's
 no chance the Notley government will win a second term. And I think 
they know that, too. (In unguarded, off-therecord moments, senior New 
Democrats will even admit their party stands almost no chance.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why this spending 
frenzy? The Notley government wants to go out in a blaze of glory. And 
if they can't convince Albertans to vote for them, they're at least 
going to force Albertans to pay for all the government caucus's lefty 
dreams before they're punted from office next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many New Democrats are still obsessed with the idea that Klein-era cuts created huge spending and infrastructure "deficits."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ralph hasn't been premier for more than 11 years. His government stopped making spending cuts nearly 20 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And by the time Klein's 
Tory party left office three years ago, it was spending more per capita 
than any other provincial government, with the possible exception of 
Newfoundland's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heck, today (March 29) is
 the fifth anniversary of Premier Klein's passing. To the extent there 
ever was a spending shortfall under Ralph, it vanished long ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, in a lot of New Dippers'minds, they continue to fight the victim-ofthe-week battles of 1993-94.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are 40 seats 
outside Edmonton and Calgary. The UCP should win 35 to 38, which leaves 
them needing between just six and nine from Alberta's two biggest cities
 to win a majority. They'll get twice that many in Calgary alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Notley NDP see this 
and have decided to buy, fund, build, borrow, slap together, trumpet, 
announce as many projects as they can before their time is up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New polling by energy research firm JWN shows just how unpopular the NDP are, especially among oil and <b>gas</b> executives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forty per cent of energy execs and managers give the Notley government an "F" on oil and <b>gas</b>; another quarter of respondents give them a "D." Just four percent give them an "A."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that's despite all of Notley's recent tough talk on pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The JWN poll also shows that an overwhelming 81 per cent think Notley's "<b>social licence</b>" experiment has utterly failed to get pipelines built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But here's a fun finding: While Notley gets an "F" from 40 per cent of oil and <b>gas</b> CEOs and investors, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Liberals get an "F" from 60 per cent.</p>

Mr. Drew Cadenhead reports</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">PULSE OIL CORP</span>. ANNOUNCES PHASE 1 OF THE BIGORAY ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY PROJECT IS UNDERWAY + NEW WELL REACTIVATIONS TARGETING LIGHT OIL</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Pulse Oil Corp</span>. has initiated phase 1 of the Bigoray Nisku Pinnacle Reef enhanced oil recovery project in the Bigoray area of Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As previously announced on Jan. 9, 2018, and as summarized below, <span class="companylink">Sproule Associates Ltd</span>.,
 an independent qualified reserves evaluator, completed an independent 
resource assessment that includes the Bigoray EOR project potential 
only, and is in addition to the previously disclosed baseline 
independently assessed reserves in the company's core areas at Bigoray 
and Queenstown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sproule assessed a best 
estimate discovered petroleum initially in place (PIIP) of 23,292,000 
barrels of oil within Pulse's 100-per-cent-controlled Nisku D and Nisku E
 Pools, which Pulse views as conservative, given the Alberta Regulator 
lists PIIP as 26.51 million boe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resource assessment was prepared in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 -- Standards of Disclosure for Oil and <b>Gas</b> Activities of the Canadian Securities Administrators and the Canadian Oil and <b>Gas</b> Evaluation Handbook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulse also announces the 
appointment of a Bigoray EOR project manager, Bill Sawchuk, a 
professional petroleum engineer and an EOR expert to oversee all 
technical and planning aspects of the EOR program. Mr. Sawchuk has over 
20 years of experience as a senior engineering manager and a technical 
expert in reservoir engineering and enhanced oil recovery methods. Mr. 
Sawchuk has previously served as an exploitation engineer for Anderson 
Exploration Ltd. and <span class="companylink">Devon Canada Corp</span>.,
 and most recently, as manager of engineering for ARC Resources Ltd., 
where he led teams to optimize production and implement valuable 
enhanced oil recovery projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulse is excited that 
initial critical facility aspects of the Bigoray EOR project are now 
under way, using working capital on hand in preparation for the EOR 
injection phase to be implemented in 2018 as planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phase 1 of the EOR 
project, which includes reactivation of existing injection facilities, 
will also allow Pulse to cost-effectively reactivate up to three current
 shut-in oil producers to add approximately 400 barrels of oil 
equivalent per day (100-per-cent working interest) of new light oil and <b>gas</b> production prior to the EOR project taking place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Cadenhead, president
 and chief operating officer of Pulse Oil, commented: "We are eagerly 
awaiting the Bigoray EOR project to be fully under way later this year 
and the start of phase 1 is a very low-cost starting point; it's really 
exciting for everyone involved. This critical facility work not only 
marks the start of the EOR project for us, it allows us to get 
additional shut-in production reactivated in the near-term while we 
prepare for the water injection phase of the project in 2018. This 
interim production boost will provide additional revenues which will be 
reinvested in the Bigoray EOR program later this year as planned."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Independent resource assessment details</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sproule independent 
resource assessment provides estimates categorized as high, best and low
 for contingent resources associated with the Bigoray EOR project on the
 two pools, with the unrisked high estimate being 8.07 million boe (92.6
 per cent oil), a best estimate of 6.136 million boe (91.3 per cent oil)
 and a low estimate of 3.668 million boe (89.1 per cent oil).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, the 
resource assessment prepared by Sproule calculated risked contingent 
resources where the risked assessment assigned a 77-per-cent chance of 
Pulse proceeding with the EOR project and resulting in a best estimate 
of risked contingent resources net to Pulse of 4,694,000 boe (91.2 per 
cent oil).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cadenhead commented: 
"The Sproule resource assessment is a positive independent commercial 
confirmation for our Bigoray Nisku enhanced oil recovery project. 
Although this assessment used a more conservative approach to petroleum 
initially in place compared with the PIIP estimates of the Alberta 
energy regulator, we are excited to see that even this more conservative
 approach resulted in a strong endorsement for the project. With an 
independent unrisked high-case upside estimated at over eight million 
boe of contingent resources (92 per cent oil), the opportunity to move 
forward with our EOR project to bring on stream substantial cash flow 
while targeting to recover those types of oil volumes without drilling a
 well, creates a substantial opportunity to enhance value for Pulse and 
our shareholders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resource assessment 
focused exclusively on two Nisku pools only in the Bigoray area, and 
included just 2,720 acres of Pulse's 44,720-acre core area holdings 
which includes 14,000 acres at Bigoray alone. Future evaluations may be 
done on Pulse's Mannville, Cardium and Pekisko formations that are 
thought to also provide significant growth opportunities for the company
 as well as additional Nisku assets/pools held within Pulse's existing 
holdings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cadenhead further 
added: "As part of the resource assessment, the evaluator assessed a 
total risk of 77 per cent that the project would proceed, citing 
economic factors and/or timing of development as one of the only risks 
associated with the project. All technical risks such as evaluation 
drilling, regulatory approvals, technology, legal factors, 
infrastructure and markets, political factors, and <b>social licence</b>
 were all assigned 100 per cent chance of commerciality. Our goal is to 
make this project happen in 2018 and with the oil prices holding firmly 
above $60 (U.S.) WTI pricing, the economics of this EOR project and 
return for shareholders continue to look more and more attractive 
alongside improving oil prices."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resource assessment 
is based on the results from 17 wells and, where available, core data. 
Where core was not available, the assessment considered log data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent resource 
volumes for these discovered resources have been classified as 
"development unclarified" with Sproule assessing that there is a high 
probability of the Bigoray EOR project becoming a commercial 
development. Pulse will continue to complete project planning associated
 with the project and move forward with its execution plans in 2018.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Significant positive 
factors relevant to the estimate of Pulse's contingent resources from 
the Bigoray EOR project include success of miscible flood development in
 nearby analogous Nisku reservoirs, a discovered thick oil column 
providing volumes for the deployment of enhanced oil recovery through a 
miscible flood and a nearby infrastructure allowing for access to 
market. Significant negative factors relevant to the estimate of Pulse's
 contingent resources from the Bigoray EOR project include uncertainty 
to how the previously fully waterflooded pools will respond to a 
miscible flood, economic viability uncertainty, as project capital and 
operating costs are unclear and areal uncertainties in the estimation of

 ("Pulse" or the "Company") (TSX-V: PUL and PUL.WT) reports today that 
Pulse has initiated Phase 1 of the Bigoray Nisku Pinnacle Reef Enhanced 
Oil Recovery ("EOR") project in the Bigoray area of Alberta ("Bigoray").</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As previously announced on January 9, 2018, and as summarized below, <span class="companylink">Sproule Associates Limited</span>
 ("Sproule"), an independent qualified reserves evaluator, completed an 
independent resource assessment that includes the Bigoray EOR project 
potential only, and is in addition to the previously disclosed baseline 
independently assessed reserves in the Company's core areas at Bigoray 
and Queenstown.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sproule
 assessed a best estimate Discovered Petroleum Initially in-Place (PIIP)
 of 23.292 million barrels of oil ("boe") within Pulse's 100% controlled
 Nisku D and Nisku E Pools, which Pulse views as conservative, given the
 Alberta Regulator lists PIIP as 26.51 million boe's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Resource Assessment was prepared in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 –Standards of Disclosure for Oil and <b>Gas</b> Activities&nbsp;of the Canadian Securities Administrators ("NI 51-101") and the Canadian Oil and <b>Gas</b> Evaluation Handbook ("COGE Handbook").</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more information on the Sproule independent resource assessment, please see "Independent Resource Assessment Details" below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulse also announces the 
appointment of a Bigoray EOR Project Manager, Bill Sawchuk, a 
Professional Petroleum Engineer and an EOR expert to oversee all 
technical and planning aspects of the EOR program. With over 20 years 
of&nbsp;experience as a senior engineering manager and a technical 
expert in reservoir engineering and enhanced oil recovery methods. Bill 
has previously served as an Exploitation Engineer for Anderson 
Exploration Ltd. and <span class="companylink">Devon Canada Corporation</span>
 and most recently, as Manager of Engineering for ARC Resources Ltd. 
where he led teams to optimize production and implement valuable 
Enhanced Oil Recovery projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulse is excited that 
initial critical facility aspects of the Bigoray EOR project are now 
underway, using working capital on hand in preparation for the EOR 
Injection Phase to be implemented in 2018 as planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phase 1 of the EOR 
project ("Phase 1"), which includes re-activation of existing injection 
facilities, will also allow Pulse to cost-effectively reactivate up to 3
 current shut-in oil producers to add approximately 400 BOE/d (100% 
working interest) of new light oil and <b>gas</b> production prior to the EOR project taking place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Cadenhead, President
 and COO of Pulse Oil, commented, "We are eagerly awaiting the Bigoray 
EOR project to be fully underway later this year and the start of Phase 1
 is a very low-cost starting point; it's really exciting for everyone 
involved.&nbsp; This critical facility work not only marks the start of 
the EOR project for us, it allows us to get additional shut-in 
production re-activated in the near-term while we prepare for the water 
injection phase of the project in 2018. This interim production boost 
will provide additional revenues which will be reinvested in the Bigoray
 EOR program later this year as planned."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Independent Resource Assessment Details:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sproule Independent 
Resource Assessment provides estimates categorized as "high", "best" and
 "low" for contingent resources associated with the Bigoray EOR project 
on the two pools, with the unrisked high estimate being 8.07 million boe
 (92.6% Oil), a best estimate of 6.136 million boe (91.3% Oil) and a low
 estimate of 3.668 million boe (89.1% Oil).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, the 
Resource Assessment prepared by Sproule calculated risked contingent 
resources where the risked assessment assigned a 77% chance of Pulse 
proceeding with the EOR project (see Table 2 below) and resulting in a 
best estimate of risked contingent resources net to Pulse of 4.694 
million boe (91.2% Oil).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Cadenhead, President
 and COO of Pulse Oil, commented, "The Sproule Resource Assessment is a 
positive independent commercial confirmation for our Bigoray Nisku 
Enhanced Oil Recovery project. Although this assessment used a more 
conservative approach to Petroleum Initially in-Place ("PIIP") compared 
with the PIIP estimates of the Alberta Energy Regulator, we are excited 
to see that even this more conservative approach resulted in a strong 
endorsement for the project. With an independent un-risked high case 
upside estimated at over 8 million boe's of contingent resources (92% 
oil), the opportunity to move forward with our EOR project to bring on 
stream substantial cashflow while targeting to recover those types of 
oil volumes without drilling a well, creates a substantial opportunity 
to enhance value for Pulse and our shareholders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Resource Assessment 
focussed exclusively on two Nisku pools only in the Bigoray area, and 
included just 2,720 acres of Pulse's 44,720 acre core area holdings 
which includes 14,000 acres at Bigoray alone. Future evaluations may be 
done on Pulse's Mannville, Cardium and Pekisko formations that are 
thought to also provide significant growth opportunities for the Company
 as well as additional Nisku assets/pools held within Pulse's existing 
holdings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cadenhead further 
added, "As part of the Resource Assessment, the evaluator assessed a 
total risk of 77% that the project would proceed, citing economic 
factors and/or timing of development as one of the only risks associated
 with the project. All technical risks such as&nbsp;evaluation drilling,
 regulatory approvals, technology, legal factors, infrastructure and 
markets, political factors and <b>social licence</b> were all assigned 
100% chance of commerciality.&nbsp;Our goal is to make this project 
happen in 2018 and with the oil prices holding firmly above US$60 WTI 
pricing, the economics of this EOR project and return for shareholders 
continue to look more and more attractive alongside improving oil 
prices." &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Resource Assessment 
is based on the results from seventeen wells and, where available, core 
data. Where core was not available, the assessment considered log data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resource 
volumes for these discovered resources have been classified as 
'development unclarified' with Sproule assessing that there is a high 
probability of the Bigoray EOR project becoming a commercial 
development. Pulse will continue to complete project planning associated
 with the project and move forward with its execution plans in 
2018.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Significant positive 
factors relevant to the estimate of Pulse's contingent resources from 
the Bigoray EOR project include success of miscible flood development in
 nearby analogous Nisku reservoirs, a discovered thick oil column 
providing volumes for the deployment of enhanced oil recovery through a 
miscible flood and a nearby infrastructure allowing for access to 
market. Significant negative factors relevant to the estimate of Pulse's
 contingent resources from the Bigoray EOR project include uncertainty 
to how the previously fully waterflooded pools will respond to a

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resource Definitions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resources encompasses all
 petroleum quantities that originally existed on or within the earth's 
crust in naturally occurring accumulations, including Discovered and 
Undiscovered (recoverable and unrecoverable) plus quantities already 
produced. "Total Resources" is equivalent to "Total Petroleum Initially 
In-Place". Resources are classified in the following categories:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total Petroleum Initially
 In-Place ("TPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is estimated to 
exist originally in naturally occurring accumulations. It includes that 
quantity of petroleum that is estimated, as of a given date, to be 
contained in known accumulations, prior to production, plus those 
estimated quantities in accumulations yet to be discovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovered Petroleum 
Initially In-Place ("DPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is 
estimated, as of a given date, to be contained in known accumulations 
prior to production. The recoverable portion of DPIIP includes 
production, reserves, and Contingent Resources; the remainder is 
unrecoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources are 
those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established 
technology or technology under development but which are not currently 
considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more 
contingencies. Economic Contingent Resources (ECR) are those contingent 
resources that are currently economically recoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undiscovered Petroleum 
Initially In Place ("UPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is 
estimated, on a given date, to be contained in accumulations yet to be 
discovered. The recoverable portion of UPIIP is referred to as 
Prospective Resources and the remainder is unrecoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective Resources are
 those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application 
of future development projects. Prospective Resources have both an 
associated chance of discovery and a chance of development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unrecoverable is that 
portion of DPIIP and UPIIP quantities which is estimated, as of a given 
date, not to be recoverable by future development projects. A portion of
 these quantities may become recoverable in the future as commercial 
circumstances change or technological developments occur; the remaining 
portion may never be recovered due to the physical/chemical constraints 
represented by subsurface interaction of fluids and reservoir rocks. 
Uncertainty Ranges are described by the Canadian Oil and <b>Gas</b> Evaluation Handbook as low, best, and high estimates for reserves and resources as follows:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low Estimate: This is 
considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities
 recovered will exceed the low estimate. If probabilistic methods are 
used, there should be at least a 90 percent probability (P90) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the low estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best Estimate: This is 
considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will actually be
 recovered. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities 
recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate. If 
probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50 percent 
probability (P50) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or 
exceed the best estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High Estimate: This is 
considered to be an optimistic estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual remaining 
quantities recovered will exceed the high estimate. If probabilistic 
methods are used, there should be at least a 10 percent probability 
(P10) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the 
high estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development Unclarified 
is a project maturity sub-class of contingent resources that refers to 
the development plan evaluation is not complete and there is ongoing 
activity to resolve any risks or uncertainties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certain resource estimate
 volumes disclosed herein are arithmetic sums of multiple estimates of 
DPIIP or UPIIP, which statistical principles indicate may be misleading 
as to volumes that may actually be recovered. Readers should give 
attention to the estimates of individual classes of resources and 
appreciate the differing probabilities of recovery associated with each 
class as explained under this&nbsp;Resource Definitions&nbsp;section.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Waterflood development</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bahar Energy Ltd. plans 
to initiate a waterflood of the FS reservoir in Bahar in 2019, starting 
with the implementation of five waterflood pilots. Assuming a positive 
reservoir response to the pilot flood, a full-scale water-injection 
project would be implemented by Bahar Energy. Initially, the drilling of
 two down-dip injection wells located in the water leg of the FS 
reservoir would be carried out. The drilling of a total of nine 
injection wells is planned over a five-year period from three existing 
platforms and one new platform to be constructed on the western flank of
 the reservoir.</p>

(1) Contingent resources are estimates of volumes that are potentially recoverable from known accumulations 
using established technology or technology under development, but which are not currently considered to be 
commercially recoverable due to one or more contingencies.
(2) The volumes reported are risked in the sense that they have been adjusted for chance of development. 
The chance of development is defined as the probability of a project being commercially viable. Quantifying 
the chance of development requires consideration of both economic contingencies and other contingencies, 
such as legal, regulatory, market access, political, <b>social licence</b>, internal and external approvals, and 
commitment to project finance and development timing. As many of these factors are extremely difficult to 
quantify, the chance of development is uncertain and must be used with caution. ERCE determined that a 
70-per-cent chance of development is appropriate for the contingent resources.
(3) Gross contingent resources are all volumes estimated to be recoverable from the field without any 
economic cut-off being applied. Gross weight interest contingent resources is adjusted for the company's 
80-per-cent working interest fraction of the gross contingent resources. net contingent resources are 
adjusted for the company's working interest share after deduction of royalty obligations.
(4) Project maturity for contingent resources has been classified as development unclarified.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has mapped a 
significant structural closure at Miocene level at a depth of between 
4,000 metres and 4,500 metres (subsea) based on 3-D seismic. The 
prospective horizon is located beneath the oil-producing reservoirs of 
the Gum Deniz oil field and this horizon has not yet been penetrated by a
 well in the Bahar purchase and sale agreement. The company is also 
monitoring the drilling of the Absheron Operating Co. (AOC) Miocene well
 test, which is located approximately four kilometres northeast of the 
Bahar project. The well is being drilled from the same surface location 
as the 2015 Hovsan 1870 <b>gas</b> discovery well, which reportedly encountered high-pressure <b>gas</b>
 of 16 million standard cubic feet per day and condensate of 640 barrels

probability that drilling the prospect would result in a discovery as defined under PRMS. ERCE has 
assigned a chance of success of 32 per cent to the prospective resources. Under COGEH, prospective 
resources are risked by a chance of commerciality, being the product of the chance of development and 
the chance of discovery. For further detail, see notes (2) to (4) of the table entitled, "Prospective 
Resources, Gum Deniz Miocene Prospect."
(5) Prospective resources are both unrisked in that they have not been multiplied by the COS and risked

(4) The chance of discovery is defined as the probability the exploration activities will confirm the 
existence of a significant accumulation of potentially recoverable resources. Quantifying the chance 
of discovery requires consideration of certain risks including the chance of success of a play, the 
chance of success of the prospect-specific properties and the prospect-specific properties qualities

John Harkins, president and chief executive officer of Greenfields, 
stated: "We are pleased that this independent analysis affirms the 
company's internal interpretation of a major waterflood development 
opportunity in the Fasila horizon in the Bahar field and a significant 
Miocene exploration objective beneath the Gum Deniz oil field that can 
be drilled from Gum Island with a suitable land-based rig, with combined

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The associated table and

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reason for variance</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The primary factors 
contributing to lower than expected production were: (i) the slower pace
 of executing scheduled workovers, reflecting, in part, limited access 
to heavy-lift vessels; (ii) the lower than expected postworkover 
production rates; and (iii) the slow pace of south Gum Deniz electric 
submersible pump (ESP) installations as workovers in old wellbores 
required additional cleaning and scraping runs. The corporation plans to
 address the limited access to heavy-lift vessels through the 
acquisition of a heavier rig that is better suited to deal with the 
challenges imposed by the old wells and difficult workovers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, Bahar 
Energy Operating Co. Ltd. elected to defer both capital and operating 
expenditures until the development plan and reservoir studies were 
completed, which would further facilitate the delineation and selection 
of the best projects going forward. The reservoir studies were initially
 expected to be completed by April 2017, in respect of the <b>gas</b> 
field, and by midyear 2017, in respect of the oil field. However, the 
studies were not completed until the first quarter of 2018 as a result 
of the identification of development opportunities (particularly 
waterfloods), additional evaluation work requested by the reserve 
auditors (<span class="companylink">GLJ Petroleum Consultants</span> and
 ERCE), and data inconsistencies resulting from scribed logs and well 
files that required clarification and further delineation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In light of 
lower-than-expected production, the company revised its 2017 budget, 
resulting in downward adjustments to capital expenditures to 
$9.7-million (from guidance of $21-million (U.S.)) and operating 
expenses to $23-million (from guidance of $28-million (U.S.)). The 
deferral of projected expenditures intended to increase gross lease 
production from 4,167 barrels of oil equivalent per day at Dec. 31, 
2016, resulted in the realization of approximately 24 per cent less 
revenue than originally expected by the company.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liberal government takes cautious approach to Mali peacekeeping</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Canada is timidly back. The Liberal government announced the return to <span class="companylink">UN peacekeeping</span>
 in a timorous voice. In a press scrum, Foreign Affairs Minister 
Chrystia Freeland let slip that caution is the watchword for the mission
 that Canadian Forces will take on in Mali. The government, she said, 
wanted to make ‘a real contribution in as careful a way as possible.’ 
That was an apt description for what Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan 
announced: Two transport helicopters and four attack helicopters will be
 sent to Mali, with crews, support troops and medical staff. It’s not 
boots on the ground, in the sense that Canadian troops won’t patrol 
dangerous areas of Mali, a country where Islamist terrorists harass 
civilians and have killed 99 United Nations peacekeepers so far. It is 
birds in the sky, and that’s a lot less risky.“ — Campbell Clark (for

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Not so long ago, Justin

 penance in the form of carbon taxes that would reduce greenhouse <b>gas</b>

right-thinking Canadians – would be happy. Today, that bargain is 
looking mighty shaky. Opponents of Trans Mountain aren’t interested in 
it. Alberta’s Premier, Rachel Notley, will probably lose her job next 
year because she has delivered carbon taxes but no pipeline. Her 
nemesis, Jason Kenney, is planning to abolish the carbon tax as soon as 
he beats her (as is likely). He points out that it has utterly failed to
 secure a <b>social licence</b> for pipelines ... And now, the

 victims’ suffering under the rug. It has offered a long overdue voice 
to the vulnerable in an unprecedented way. But its unintended side

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rita Joe dies</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">March 20, 2007- They 
called her Gentle Warrior. But the woman known as the poet laureate of 
the Mi’kmaq people had battle scars, earned from childhood. Rita Bernard
 was born in Whycocomagh, Cape Breton, on March 15, 1932. Her mother 
died when she was 5; her father when she was 10. She lived in numerous 
foster homes and suffered abuse. At 12, she arrived at Shubenacadie 
Indian Residential School. She thought it looked like a castle; later, 
she compared it to prison. After four years there, she had to relearn 
Mi’kmaq, her native language, as she later recounted in her poem, I Lost
 My Talk. She eventually married Frank Joe and they raised eight 
children, including two foster children. “Only a housewife with a 
dream,” as she described herself, she began writing in her 30s. But she 
went on to publish seven books, including an autobiography, Song of Rita
 Joe, and was awarded the Order of Canada. I Lost My Talk eventually 
became the basis for a <span class="companylink">National Arts Centre</span>
 show and was quoted in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission report. 
“Let me find my talk, so I can teach you about me,” it ends. Rita Joe 
died March 20, 2007, an unfinished poem in her typewriter. Marsha

 for pipelines. “Very expensive political theatre for Albertans," he 
calls it. And now, the anti-carbon-tax crusader Doug Ford could well 
become premier of Ontario. It's hard to see how Mr. Trudeau will impose 
his grand bargain on the provinces if Alberta and Ontario are in open 
revolt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what about the rest of us?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liberals, 
environmentalists and economists tell us carbon taxes are a virtually 
painless way to get us to act virtuously, by cutting down on fossil 
fuels. They are a good tax. Unfortunately, too many of us don't like 
them anyway. As Mr. Ford likes to say whenever he has a chance, “A tax 
is a tax is a tax."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carbon taxes are 
allegedly revenue-neutral because the money is returned to taxpayers in 
the form of rebates or offset by lower taxes elsewhere. But the reality 
is different. In fact, governments can't keep their greedy mitts off the
 money. Even the model province of British Columbia is now diverting 
part of its provincial carbon tax to fund tax credits for preferred 
groups, such as filmmakers. In Alberta, only about a quarter of the 
amount raised by the carbon tax is rebated to taxpayers. Sadly, there is
 a vast difference between the pure world of economic models and the 
grubby world of politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another problem with 
carbon taxes is that you can't possibly make them high enough to be 
effective. If you did you'd be voted out of office. Mr. Trudeau's 
national carbon pricing scheme would start at $10 a tonne, going up to 
$50 by 2022 – enough to be a nuisance, but not nearly enough to affect 
consumer behaviour in any meaningful way. Achieving real behavioural 
change, environmental economists say, would cost many times more. 
According to Simon Fraser University economist Mark Jaccard, carbon 
taxes can only have real impact if governments also introduce a bunch of
 costly and heavy-handed regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, carbon 
taxes can't save the planet. Despite what politicians tell you, they 
basically amount to useless virtuesignalling. But Mr. Trudeau, Ms. 
Notley and Environment Minister Catherine McKenna aren't going to tell 
you this because they want you to believe they have a plan and that the 
plan will work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the date for Mr. 
Trudeau's carbon tax gets closer, taxpayers might start asking an even 
more basic question: What difference will this make in the big scheme of
 things? As India and China and the whole developing world increase 
energy use, and the United States extracts more fossil fuel than ever in
 its history, why are we getting this darn tax?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no good answer 
for that. The gap between reality and our intentions is unfathomably 
vast. To avoid the most serious effects of global warming, we should be 
adding about 1,100 megawatts of clean-energy capacity a day – equivalent
 to one nuclear power plant – according to the the MIT Technology 
Review. What we're actually adding: 151 megawatts a day. The 
technologies that are needed to cut emissions deeply simply haven't been
 developed yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“[V]irtually all sober 
analyses conclude that the target [of two degrees of warming] is now 
unobtainable," climate expert Ted Nordhaus wrote in Foreign Affairs. But
 don't blame venal politicians or evil industry. The root of the problem
 is much more basic, he argues: “Decarbonization is hard." He calls the 
insistence that we can meet the 2 C threshold a dangerous delusion that 
distracts us from what we can do to address the changes that are coming 
no matter what.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of this is a 
rationale for doing nothing. We should be doing a lot, on many fronts, 
to develop the breakthrough technologies that will really make a 
difference. Forking over billions for government to use however they 
like does not strike me as part of the solution.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there's one thing I hope all Albertans can agree on, it's the desperate need for more pipelines to get our abundant oil and <b>gas</b>
 resources to market. According to recent reports, Alberta is losing $7 
billion per year because of lack of pipeline capacity, with industry 
losing $6.7 billion more annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While we disagree with 
how the NDP has handled the strategy surrounding the Trans Mountain 
expansion, we don't doubt the need for the pipeline.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It
 wasn't that long ago when pipelines were built in this country with 
little controversy. Under the previous Harper government, four major 
pipeline projects were completed. Keystone, Alberta Clipper, the Line 9 
reversal and Anchor Loop were all successfully completed under the 
previous government, adding 1.73 million barrels per day of capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, it is true that none
 of these projects were to tidewater, as the NDP is happy to point out. 
But Trans Mountain was not up for government approval under the previous
 Conservative government. The NDP's cousins in Ottawa would no doubt 
have howled if the Harper government dared to short circuit the 
regulatory process by approving a pipeline before a thorough review was 
completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northern Gateway, the one
 tidewater pipeline up for decision under the Harper Conservatives, was 
indeed approved. Sadly, the project was retroactively cancelled by the 
Trudeau Liberals as part of their plan to ban tanker traffic off B.C.'s 
northern coast (never mind that Alaskan tankers have travelled down that
 route for decades). And the Trudeau Liberals later rigged the approval 
process midstream to scuttle Energy East, another pipeline to tidewater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, radical activists have engaged in a concerted effort to specifically target and sideline Canada's oil and <b>gas</b>
 industry. Millions of dollars of foreign funding have flooded into the 
Canadian environmental movement with the clear goal of starving our 
resources of markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta NDP government promised that imposing a carbon tax on Albertans would buy so-called <b>social licence</b>
 in B.C. for a pipeline to the Pacific. We are baffled the Alberta 
government bought this argument, since it's their fellow travellers - 
both the B.C. NDP and radical environmental activists such as Tzeporah 
Berman - who are leading the fight against the approved Trans Mountain 
expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surely, the Alberta NDP 
understood that their friends would not be willing to trade a carbon tax
 for a pipeline. In fact, Premier Rachel Notley finally acknowledged 
this reality in a recent interview with <span class="companylink">CBC Radio</span>.
 When asked why not put a hold on the carbon tax until the pipeline 
begins construction, she responded, "quite honestly, I don't know that 
B.C. would care one way or another if we did that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The truth is that the 
Trudeau Liberals provided paper regulatory approval for the pipeline, 
purportedly because of Alberta's willingness to impose a carbon tax on 
its citizens. Yet today, the Trudeau Liberals are willing to do little 
beyond rhetoric to fight for Trans Mountain in the face of vociferous 
opposition in B.C., hurting the 51 First Nations that have signed off in
 support of the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's in all 
Albertans'interest to see this pipeline succeed. We in the United 
Conservative Party welcome the government's recent about face. After 
months mocking our suggestions to threaten the B.C. NDP with serious 
consequences, including potentially cutting off oil shipments and 
tolling B.C. natural <b>gas</b>, the premier has finally accepted our advice, albeit far too late.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We welcome a robust, 
serious debate on what's needed to get this pipeline built. But we 
should not be deluded into the fantasy that punitive taxes on everyday 
Albertans will appease the fringe yet extremely vocal anti-pipeline 
minority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, we must make it 
clear to the vast majority of reasonable Canadians that the success of 
our energy sector is critical for the success of our country, and that 
Alberta cannot be taken for granted any longer. Prasad Panda is the

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are three things that taxpayers should note.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First,
 it's positive to see Premier Notley continues to publicly push for the 
Trans Mountain pipeline project - an initiative that will pay a fortune 
in taxes to the Alberta government and create jobs and opportunities for
 our province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's important that the 
premier has spoken out and has seemingly muzzled radical 
environmentalists in her own party on the issue - such as her education 
minister who previously led a chant at a protest at the legislature 
against the oil sands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, what should also be clear by now is that Premier Notley's carbon tax hasn't earned our province the "<b>social licence</b>" we were promised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The premier is shutting 
down coal power plants, Albertans have paid a fortune in carbon taxes 
and other new costly environmental regulations have been layered on our 
economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite all those moves, radical environmentalists in B.C. are still protesting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only have we lost 
jobs because of these policies, the government's own numbers suggest our
 province still won't meet climate change targets in the Paris Accord.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what's the point? 
Clearly, it's time to scrap the carbon tax and pursue a new, 
taxpayer-friendly approach. For example, let's refocus on getting 
Canada's natural <b>gas</b> over to China so that we can offset some of their coal power plants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second point 
Albertans should be mindful about is the section in the throne speech 
that boasts about reducing "hospitality and travel costs" and providing 
"no raises" for teachers and nurses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's true the government reduced travel and hospitality costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our calculations - based 
on an enormous spreadsheet released by the government - shows a $4 
million reduction in travel and hospitality expenses over the past four 
@colincraig1 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a great step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the grand scheme of the province's $56-billion budget, it's not a lot of money, but it's a good case of leading by example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for "no raises" for teachers and nurses - that's just not true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Calgary and Edmonton school boards indicated in letters to the <span class="companylink">Canadian Taxpayers Federation</span> that a combined 6,842 teachers in their divisions are receiving a pay increase this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thousands of other teachers across the province will also receive a pay increase due to the way the contract was negotiated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many teachers in Alberta 
will still receive a true freeze, but for the government to suggest that
 all teachers are receiving a freeze is simply not true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, the government's
 news release about the throne speech notes, "work will continue with 
the public sector to reduce costs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the government has 
trimmed some spending, taxpayers should know that overall spending has 
increased every year since the NDP were elected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the government is currently on pace to spend about $1 billion more this year than they originally budgeted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debt is still expected to more than triple during Premier Notley's four years in office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that's the big 
picture problem with the Alberta government's approach - some tinkering 
around the edges, but not enough in terms of bold action to get the 
province's spending under control and get our province back on the right
 track.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jason
 Kenney, the UCP leader, introduced a private member's bill on Thursday 
that would force the Notley government to hold a referendum before it 
increases its carbon tax again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP imposed a carbon tax of $20 a tonne back in 2017.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conveniently,
 during the 2015 provincial election, neither Rachel Notley nor her 
party mentioned the possibility of a tax on everything that moves or 
generates power using fossil fuels. (I guess they wanted it to be a 
surprise.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's not a "lie" lie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not like knowing you
 would introduce such a tax if elected, yet telling everyone you 
definitely wouldn't. It's more like knowing you would, but "forgetting" 
to tell anyone until after you were safely in office. (Oops. Sorry. 
Didn't we mention that? We were sure we had.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, after the NDP 
introduced the carbon tax they also tried to insist it wasn't a tax, it 
was a levy. As if that makes a bit of difference down here on the ground
 where we have to pay the "levy" on every tank of gasoline, every 
gigajoule of natural <b>gas</b> we use to heat our homes during a Prairie winter and every apple and box of cereal trucked to our neighbourhood grocery store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then this past New Year's Day, of course, the New Dems increased their bombshell "carbon levy" by a whopping 50 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The carbon levy on natural <b>gas</b> is now equal to about 75 per cent of the cost of the natural <b>gas</b> itself. Put another way, Rachel Notley's carbon tax is the equivalent of a 75 per cent GST on nat <b>gas</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney's legislation, 
Bill 202, would require the New Democrats to seek permission from 
Alberta voters before they increase the carbon tax again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta already has a 
Taxpayer Protection Act that prevents any provincial government from 
introducing a sales tax without first winning approval from voters in a 
provincewide referendum. Kenney's bill simply adds a carbon tax to that 
act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney's legislation 
states "the opinion of the people of Alberta should be obtained directly
 before any legislation that levies a general provincial sales tax, 
increases a carbon tax rate or imposes a new or expanded carbon tax."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seems fair. As Kenney 
explains, 25 years ago when he was president of the Canadian Federation 
of Taxpayers and helped press the Klein government to pass the original 
Alberta Taxpayer Protection Act (ATPA), no one had heard of a carbon 
tax, so no one thought to include one in the law back then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Yet as nearly everything
 Albertans do or consume is linked to carbon," Kenney explained Thursday
 "the NDP's carbon tax at the very least violates the spirit" of the 
ATPA. "My bill rectifies and clarifies this by specifically adding 
'carbon tax'to the law requiring a referendum for a provincial 
consumption tax."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Needless to say, if the 
UCP win next year's provincial election, they will repeal the carbon tax
 altogether. But in the meantime, Bill 202 would keep the NDP from 
jacking it up yet again without first holding a binding referendum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the NDP will use their majority in the legislature to defeat Kenney's bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All their recent tough 
talk about pipelines and fiscal restraint and the B.C. government being 
full of "s**theads" is just that - talk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At heart, the NDP have not changed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They still believe in 
their Climate Leadership Plan. They still believe their carbon tax is 
necessary to save the planet. They're still sure (despite all evidence 
to the contrary) the carbon tax will buy "<b>social licence</b>" to get pipelines built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, as rampant spenders of tax dollars, their government still needs the money.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's Opposition United Conservatives say there should be no more carbon tax increase without the consent of voters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Party leader Jason Kenney
 introduced a private member's bill Thursday that would ban any future 
hikes on the existing tax or on reinstating such a levy in the future 
without a referendum.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Albertans
 should get the final say before the government digs deeper into their 
pockets," Kenney said after introducing the bill, which would need the 
support of Premier Rachel Notley's government to become law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney has called the carbon tax an unfair burden on Alberta residents, with little benefit to reaching greenhouse <b>gas</b> emission targets or to getting oil pipelines built. He has promised to kill the tax if he becomes premier in the 2019 election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The levy was imposed by 
Notley in 2017 on heating and gasoline to fund green projects ranging 
from solar panels to multibillion-dollar transit projects and programs 
to phase out coalfired electricity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province is taking in
 about $1 billion this fiscal year from the levy, but is returning some 
of that through rebates to middle and low-income families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The UCP contends the carbon tax has failed in its main objective to buy "<b>social licence</b>"
 and give Alberta some moral high ground against pipeline opponents by 
demonstrating it is committed to balancing resource development with 
environmental stewardship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government house leader 
Brian Mason, responding to Kenney's bill, said the tax is succeeding, 
and led to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government approving the 
Trans Mountain pipeline expansion from Edmonton to Burnaby in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It [the tax and climate 
plan] is probably our best tool to keep the federal government's nose to
 the grindstone when it comes to seeing through the decision to build 
the Trans Mountain pipeline, and Mr. Kenney would strike it from our 
hands," said Mason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta is losing 
millions of dollars a day because its heavy oil is discounted due to 
pipeline bottlenecks and lack of access to customers in overseas 
markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trans Mountain line 
would triple the crude going west from Alberta, but the project is 
opposed by the British Columbia government and has been tied up in 
permit delays, court challenges and political roadblocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley banned wine from 
B.C. for two weeks in February in protest. Last week she announced she 
will get legislation passed giving her the option to cut oil exports to 
B.C. and grant power to take punitive action on natural <b>gas</b> shipments that travel from B.C. through Alberta to the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She has also urged 
Trudeau's government to step up in the fight, given that 
inter-provincial pipelines are federal responsibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley reiterated 
Thursday that her government has tied its compliance with Trudeau's 
federal climate plan, and the looming federal tax on carbon, to the 
success of the Trans Mountain line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The issue around 
additional levies is definitely linked to the pipeline, and our 
government - as I've said before - will not move forward until we get 
the pipeline."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal climate plan would tax greenhouse <b>gas</b> emissions starting at $10 per tonne this year, rising $10 a year to $50 a tonne in 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta taxes greenhouse 
gases at $30 a tonne, and Kenney has been pushing Notley on whether she 
will challenge Ottawa if it tries to impose a tax above the province's 
current rate.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 latest proof is in, although the facts have been obvious for many 
years. Foreigners are financing and organizing opposition in Canada to 
natural resource development, part of an anti-fossil-fuel campaign that 
is costing our economy an estimated $15 billion this year, due to lack 
of access to international markets, and much more in lost capital 
investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the most recent 
little gem will finally get the chattering class to acknowledge reality:
 A leaked U.S. document preparing mass-action protests against <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s
 Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project. It sets out goals and 
operating principles for a clandestine organization designed to drive 
political resistance under the guise of an independent rank-and-file 
protest movement.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Action Hive Proposal" was written by Cam Fenton, an employee of <span class="companylink">350.org</span>,
 a California-based NGO "building a global grassroots climate movement."
 Using insect analogies (theirs, not mine) the "Hive" contributes money,
 action and organizational experience and technical know-how, while a 
"Swarm" will generate mass action. Fenton is explicit about its "Purpose
 &amp; Shared Goals: This group is coming together to support mass 
popular resistance to construction of the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not the only U.S. organization devoted to blocking development of Canada's oil and <b>gas</b>
 reserves that, incidentally, would compete with America's own 
resources. Vivian Krause, a Vancouver-based researcher and writer, has 
documented the money funnelled through Tides Foundation, New Venture 
Fund and the Oak Foundation to impede Canadian hydrocarbon growth, 
especially the oil sands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These organizations are 
bolstered by a coterie of narcissistic celebrities whose vacuous 
certainty is outdone by their ignorance of science and economics and 
their extravagant carbon-intensive lifestyles.? All this brings to mind 
when, as minister of natural resources, I wrote an open letter labelling
 certain environmental groups as "radicals," financed in part by 
non-Canadian donors. The derisive outcry was deafening from media, 
opposition parties, ENGOs and even a few timorous senior executives in 
the oil and <b>gas</b> business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I defined radical as 
opposition to every major resource project. Moreover, I issued a 
challenge to any environmental organization to name a single pipeline 
project that it supported. The silence was deafening. Possibly because 
my definition sounded too reasonable, the media never reported on my 
explanation of the definition or the challenge, which I reiterated 
numerous times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What I said was factual 
then and has been conclusively proven to be true over the past six 
years. Trying to shut down fossil-fuel development is not viewed as 
radical to many environmentalists, even though the economic consequences
 would be disastrous. Or perhaps it was impolite in Canada to use the 
"r" word. It was obviously politically incorrect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Irrespective of 
terminology, we have undoubtedly reached a crisis resulting from 
unrelenting opposition to pipeline construction, abetted by foreign 
funding and a federal government obsessed with green ideology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is telling that opponents are unimpressed by governments' efforts to reduce greenhouse <b>gas</b>
 (GHG) emissions. They understand that Canada cannot make a meaningful 
difference to international emissions, since our output represents only 
1.6 per cent of the global total. Their focus is on the oil sands, which
 they claim can measurably add to the global supply of oil, so keeping 
fossil fuels in the ground is their goal. The fact the oil sands only 
represent a minuscule one-thousandth of global emissions makes it the 
wrong target. But symbolism is everything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Militants are indifferent
 to the terrible damage they are inflicting on our economy, First 
Nations and the poor, all without any measurable impact on global 
warming. Further, they assert that Canada has a moral responsibility to 
make costly but ineffective sacrifices, even though other countries are 
not doing their share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The B.C. government's 
campaign against the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion proves there is 
no point in succumbing to extortionate demands or making costly 
concessions to achieve an elusive <b>social licence</b>. The goal posts 
keep moving. By now, that must be evident even to Alberta Premier Rachel
 Notley and federal Natural Resource Minister Jim Carr, though they will
 never admit it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At what point might <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 headquarters in Houston cancel the project in frustration with its 
mounting financial and reputational risk? That would landlock Canada's 
energy for a very long time, a disastrous result, which is the goal of 
opponents. It is time for Parliament to declare the pipeline a work "for
 the general advantage of Canada," thereby removing most dilatory 
tactics (but not social resistance). Prime Minister Justin Trudeau 
should also tell foreign agitators to butt out of Canadian affairs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall says what he calls the New Left are the likes of today's NDP and the Trudeau version of the Liberals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall remembers when the

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think we're going to find out if fiscal responsibility is cool again. Because most decidedly it is not cool right now."</p>

 chicken came home to roost and there was pain.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"How could we have 
forgotten the importance of fiscal responsibility?" Wall says the Notley
 NDP are being "shortsighted" with their spending.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Jason, the 1990s are calling and they want their ridiculous ideas back," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall fires back. "I think
 the '90s are calling: Have we forgotten?" says Wall, hoping for a 
return to "some sort of reasonable fiscal plan that isn't based on 
rainbows and unicorns."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall also doesn't like how people have surrendered the word "progressive" to the leftists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What is progressive 
about pursuing policies that don't put the economy first, that don't put
 a priority on making sure people are working? What's progressive about 
long-term deficits that are actually going to visit great pain on those 
who are most vulnerable?" Wall wouldn't be Wall if he didn't give an 
elbow to Quebec. On equalization, of course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Folks, I'm going to say this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'd go to

 don't do anything that would upset la belle province."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a $19-billion 
federal program and $11.3 billion of it goes to a 400-year old economy 
in the second-most populous province in the country. There's an issue 
there."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Michael Binnion reports</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTERRE REPORTS YEAR-END RESERVES AND RESOURCES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questerre Energy Corp</span>. has released the results of its Dec. 31, 2017, reserves assessment and evaluation of its oil and natural <b>gas</b> properties, as evaluated by <span class="companylink">McDaniel &amp; Associates Consultants Ltd</span>. with an effective date of Dec. 31, 2017, prepared in accordance with the standards contained in the Canadian oil and <b>gas</b> evaluation handbook and National Instrument 51-101 -- Standards of Disclosure for Oil and <b>Gas</b> Activities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, president and chief executive officer, commented: "Our 
reserve growth reflects the active drilling program at Kakwa this year 
and the light oil acquisition at Antler. Corporate proved and probable 
reserves gross reserves grew by 20 per cent or 3.22 million barrels of 
oil equivalent from 15.7 mmboe to 18.41 mmboe, net of production during 
the year. The before-tax NPV10 [net present value at a 10-per-cent 
discount] estimated for the corporate proved and probable reserves using
 McDaniel's year-end price forecast is $174.7-million."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commenting on Questerre's
 Utica resources in Quebec, he added: "The reserve engineers updated our
 resource report from last year for their current price forecast. The 
best estimate of risked contingent resources net to Questerre for the 
Becancour and Lotbiniere project areas is unchanged at 214 billion cubic
 feet. These project areas as assessed only cover 5 per cent of our 
total acreage. The risked net present value discounted at 10 per cent 
before tax for this limited development area is $301-million compared to
 $311-million last year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credit facility</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company also reported
 on the status of its credit facility review that was conducted in the 
fourth quarter of 2017. The lender has advised that the primary credit 
facility will be renewed at $18-million. The facility will include a 
$17.9-million revolving operating demand facility. Credit facility A can
 be used for general corporate purposes, continuing operations and 
capital expenditures within Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dec. 31, 2017, reserve information</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In accordance with the 
requirements of NI 51-101, the company anticipates filing its annual 
information form that includes more detailed disclosure relating to 
petroleum and natural <b>gas</b> activities for the 2017 fiscal year, in the form of Form 51-101F1, at the end of March, 2018, as set out in the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The associated tables set forth contain certain information relating to the oil and natural <b>gas</b>
 reserves of the company's properties and the present value of the 
estimated future net cash flow associated with such reserves as at Dec. 
31, 2017, which numbers may vary slightly from those presented in the

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dec. 31, 2017, Quebec resource information</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questerre also reported on the year-end update prepared by <span class="companylink">GLJ Petroleum Consultants Ltd</span>.
 to the independent resource assessment of its 735,910 gross (190,800 
net) acres in the St. Lawrence lowlands, Quebec, that have potential for
 the Upper Utica shale effective Dec. 31, 2017, in a report dated March 
5, 2018. The GLJ resource assessment was prepared in accordance with NI 
51-101 and the standards contained in the COGE handbook. The GLJ 
resource assessment did not include any of the corporation's other 
properties. All anticipated results disclosed herein were prepared by 
GLJ, which is an independent qualified reserves evaluator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GLJ used probabilistic 
methods to generate low, best and high estimates of total petroleum 
initially in place (TPIIP), both discovered and undiscovered. 
Recoverable contingent and prospective resources over Questerre's 
acreage were estimated by analogy and based on available well data over 
the Quebec Utica and public data from U.S. Utica and Marcellus shale 
plays. The evaluation consisted of the Upper Utica which includes the 
Indian Castle and Dolgeville members as well as the Flat Creek. The Flat
 Creek, the lowermost member, was only evaluated to estimate 
undiscovered petroleum initially in place (UPIIP). No recoverable 
resources were assigned to the Flat Creek given the lack of test data 
showing established technology can support commercial development at 
this time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GLJ resource 
assessment is based on the results from several vertical and horizontal 
wells on the Questerre's acreage that have all encountered pay in the 
Utica. Test data from these wells in conjunction with offset development
 and studies of the analogous U.S. Utica support the prospective 
commercial development of these resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Significant positive factors relevant to the estimate of Questerre's resources include the importation of all natural <b>gas</b>
 consumed in Quebec creating demand for local production, premium 
realized pricing due to the transportation costs associated with 
importing natural <b>gas</b> for consumption, production test data from 
Questerre's existing wells and the development of the analogous Utica 
shale in the United States. Significant negative factors include the 
limited number of wells on Questerre's acreage, lack of a developed 
service sector providing uncertainty regarding estimates of capital and 
operating costs, developing hydrocarbon regulations and environmental 
legislation and the requirement to obtain social acceptability for oil 
and <b>gas</b> operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Questerre believes 
it will have sufficient financial capability to finance its share of 
costs associated with the development program in the GLJ resource 
assessment, it may not have access to the necessary capital when 
required. Conducting the development program is also dependent on the 
participation by Questerre's joint venture partners. There is no 
guarantee that they will elect to participate in the program to the 
extent required. Questerre retains the right to conduct activities 
without the operators' participation on an independent operations basis 
whereby it can finance 100 per cent of the capital costs for certain 
well operations and facilities in return for net revenue equal to 400 
per cent of its capital investment before the operators can elect to 
either remain in a penalty position or hold a working interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent resources</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The TPIIP was determined 
probabilistically on a permit basis with estimates of 45 billion to 145 
billion cubic feet per square mile for the Upper Utica. This compares 
favourably with analogous U.S. shale plays with estimates of the Utica 
in Ohio at between 35 billion and 85 billion cubic feet per square mile 
and 25 billion to 150 billion cubic feet per square mile for the 
Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania. Of the TPIIP estimated over Questerre's
 acreage, only land within a three-mile radius of a successfully tested 
well was quantified as discovered <b>gas</b> in place. Based on this 
qualification only 16 per cent of the total mapped TPIIP in the Upper 
Utica was considered discovered contingent resource.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Upper Utica was 
considered undiscovered for approximately 84 per cent of the total 
mapped TPIIP. Recovery factors of 18 per cent, 26 per cent and 37 per 
cent were applied to the low, best and high estimates resource cases, 
respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Summary information 
regarding contingent resources and net present value of future net 
revenues from contingent resources is set forth below and is derived, in
 each case, from the GLJ resource assessment. All contingent resources 
evaluated in the GLJ resource assessment were deemed economic at the 
effective date of Dec. 31, 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questerre's average 
working interest in its gross best estimate contingent resources is 25.9
 per cent. In addition to Questerre's working interest, the company also
 holds a royalty interest in the acreage and associated resources. As a 
result, in some cases Questerre's net volumes (after royalties) exceed 
its working interest volumes. For clarity, included in the associated 
tables are Questerre's volume before royalties, gross working interest 
volumes and net volumes after royalties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A range of contingent resources estimates (low, best and high) was prepared by GLJ.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GLJ resources 
assessment estimated gross risked contingent resources with a project 
maturity subclass of development on hold of 18.6 million boe (low 
estimate) to 50 million boe (high estimate), with a best estimate of 
30.4 million boe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GLJ resources 
assessment estimated gross risked contingent resources with a project 
maturity subclass of development unclarified of 8.9 million boe (low 
estimate) to 23.8 million boe (high estimate), with a best estimate of 
14.6 million boe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estimate of risked net
 present value of future net revenue of contingent resources is 
preliminary in nature and is provided to assist the reader in reaching 
an opinion on the merit and likelihood of the company proceeding with 
the required investment. It includes contingent resources that are 
considered too uncertain with respect to the chance of development to be
 classified as reserves. There is uncertainty that the risked net 
present value of future net revenue will be realized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent resources can 
be subclassified based on their project maturity subclass which help 
identify a project's change of commerciality. The project maturity 
subclasses for contingent resources are development pending, development
 on hold, development unclarified or development not viable, all as 
defined in the COGE handbook. Development pending is when resolution of 
the final conditions for development is being actively pursued (high 
chance of development). Development on hold is when there is a 
reasonable chance of development, but there are major non-technical 
contingencies to be resolved that are usually beyond the control of the 
operator. Development unclarified is when the evaluation is incomplete 
and there is continuing activity to resolve any risks or uncertainties. 
Development not viable is when no further data acquisition or evaluation
 is currently planned and hence there is a low chance of development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those areas classified as
 development on hold are primarily contingent on the passage of 
applicable hydrocarbon and environmental legislation and regulations as 
well as local acceptability. Remaining areas classified as development 
unclarified have additional contingency or risk associated with securing
 <b>social licence</b> to operate and are thereby a lower priority for 
development. Additional contingencies include firm development plans, 
detailed cost estimates and corporate approvals and sanctioning. There 
is no certainty that any portion of the contingent resources will be 
economic to develop. Though pilot horizontal development plans have been
 proposed, the project evaluation scenario for the contingent resources 
is not sufficiently defined to make an investment decision to proceed to
 development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent resources are 
evaluated based on the same fiscal conditions used in the assessment of 
reserves, and as such, are forecasted to be economic. Contingent 
resource values are estimated on the basis of established technology, 
namely multistage hydraulic fracturing recovery technologies that are 
widely used in the development of shale <b>gas</b> plays including in the Montney in Canada and the Utica formation in Ohio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chance of 
commerciality for contingent resources is equal to the product of the 
chance of discovery and the chance of development. Chance of discovery 
is the estimated probability that exploration activities will confirm 
the existence of a significant accumulation of potentially recoverable 
petroleum. Chance of development is the estimated probability that, once
 discovered, a known accumulation will be commercially developed. Based 
on contingencies related to the passage of applicable hydrocarbon and 
environmental legislation, regulations, local acceptability, and 
additional risk associated with securing <b>social licence</b> to 
operate, firm development plans, detailed cost estimates and corporate 
approvals GLJ estimated the chance of development for the development 
unclarified subclass ranges between 10 per cent and 25 per cent as 
detailed in the associated table. By definition the chance of discovery 
for contingent resource is 100 per cent. The corresponding chance of 
commerciality for the development unclarified subclass is therefore 
estimated at between 10 per cent and 25 per cent as detailed in the 
associated table.</p>

Notes:
(1) Contingent resources are defined in the COGE handbook as those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given 
date, to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established technology or technology under 
development, but which are not currently considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more contingencies.
There is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the contingent resources or that
Questerre will produce any portion of the volumes currently classified as contingent resources. The estimates of 
contingent resources involve implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the resources 
described exists in the quantities predicted or estimated, as at a given date, and that the resources can be 
profitably produced in the future. The risked net present value of the future net revenue from the contingent 
resources does not represent the fair market value of the contingent resources. Actual contingent resources (and 
any volumes that may be reclassified as reserves) and future production therefrom may be greater than or less 
than the estimates provided herein.
(2) GLJ prepared the estimates of contingent resources shown for each property using deterministic principles and 
methods. Probabilistic aggregation of the low and high property estimates shown in the table might produce 
different total volumes than the arithmetic sums shown in the table.
(3) Gross contingent resources are Questerre's working interest (operating or non-operating) share before 
deduction of royalties and without including any royalty interests of Questerre. Net contingent resources are 
Questerre's working interest (operating or non-operating) share after deduction of royalty obligations, plus 
Questerre's royalty interests in contingent resources.
(4) The risked net present value of future net revenue attributable to the contingent resources does not represent 
the fair market value of the contingent resources. Estimated abandonment and reclamation costs have been included 
in the evaluation.
(5) Low estimate contingent resources are considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the low estimate. 
If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 90-per-cent probability (P90) that the quantities 
actually recovered will equal or exceed the low estimate.
(6) Best estimate contingent resources are considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will actually 
be recovered. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than 
the best estimate. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50-per-cent probability (P50) 
that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the best estimate.
(7) High estimate contingent resources are considered to be an optimistic estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the high 
estimate. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 10-per-cent probability (P10) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the high estimate.
(8) The chance of development (CoDev) is the estimated probability that, once discovered, a known accumulation 
will be commercially developed. Five factors have been considered in determining the CoDev as follows:
CoDev equals Ps (economic factor) times Ps (technology factor) times Ps (development plan factor)  times Ps 
(development time frame factor) times Ps (other contingency factor) wherein Ps is the probability of success.
Economic factor -- For reserves to be assessed, a project must be economic. With respect to contingent 
resources, this factor captures uncertainty in the assessment of economic status principally due to uncertainty 
in cost estimates and marketing options. Economic viability uncertainty due to technology is more aptly captured 
with the technology factor. The economic factor will be one for reserves and will often be one for development 
pending projects and for projects with a development study or predevelopment study with a robust rate of 
return. A robust rate of return means that the project retains economic status with variation in costs and/or 
marketing plans over the expected range of outcomes for these variables.
Technology factor -- For reserves to be assessed, a project must utilize established technology. With respect to 
contingent resources, this factor captures the uncertainty in the viability of the proposed technology for 
the subject reservoir, namely, the uncertainty associated with technology under development. By definition, 
technology under development is a recovery process or process improvement that has been determined to be 
technically viable via field test and is being field tested further to determine its economic viability in the 
subject reservoir. The technology factor will be one for reserves and for established technology. For technology 
under development, this factor will consider different risks associated with technologies being developed at 
the scale of the well versus the scale of a project and technologies which are being modified or extended for 
the subject reservoir versus new emerging technologies which have not previously been applied in any 
commercial application. The risk assessment will also consider the quality and sufficiency of the test data 
available, the ability to reliably scale such data and the ability to extrapolate results in time.
Development plan factor -- For reserves to be assessed, a project must have a detailed development plan. 
With respect to contingent resources, this factor captures the uncertainty in the project evaluation 
scenario. The development plan factor will be one for reserves and high, approaching one, for development 
pending projects. This factor will consider development plan detail variations including the degree of 
delineation, reservoir specific development and operating strategy detail (technology decision, well 
layouts (spacing and pad locations), completion strategy, start-up strategy, water source and disposal, other 
infrastructure, facility design, marketing plans) and the quality of the cost estimates as provided by the 
developer.
Development time frame factor -- In the case of major projects, for reserves to be assessed, first major capital 
spending must be initiated within five years of the effective date. The development time frame factor will be 
one for reserves and will often be one for development pending projects provided the project is planned 
on stream based on the same criteria used in the assessment of reserves. With respect to contingent resources, 
the factor will approach one for projects planned on stream with a time frame slightly longer than the 
limiting reserves criteria.
Other contingency factor -- For reserves to be assessed, all contingencies must be eliminated. With respect 
to contingent resources, this factor captures major contingencies, usually beyond the control of the operator, 
other than those captured by economic status, technology status, project evaluation scenario status and the 
development time frame. The other contingency factor will be one for reserves and for development pending 
projects and less than one for on hold. Provided all contingencies have been identified and their resolution 
is reasonably certain, this factor would also be one for development unclarified projects.
These factors may be interrelated (dependent) and care has been taken to ensure that risks are appropriately 
accounted.
(1) Contingent resources for the lowlands have been estimated based the results from several vertical and 
horizontal wells on the company's acreage that have all encountered pay in the Utica. Test data from these wells 
in conjunction with offset development and studies of analogous U.S. Utica support the prospective commercial 
development on these resources. The estimated unrisked cost to bring these contingent resources on commercial 
production is $809.28-million and the expected timeline is between two and 11 years. The specific contingencies 
for these resources are the passage of applicable hydrocarbon and environmental legislation, regulations, local 
acceptability, firm development plans, detailed cost estimates and corporate approvals and sanctioning.
(2) In Canada, GLJ has estimated a company gross aggregate of risked on hold best estimate contingent resources 
of 30.42 million boe for the projects outlined. Utilizing established recovery technology, the risked estimated 
cost to bring these resources on commercial production is an aggregate of $168-million with an expected 
timeline of two to four years.

St. Edouard-de-Lotbiniere -- Based on contingencies related to the passage of applicable hydrocarbon and

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Summary information 
regarding prospective resources and net present value of future net 
revenues from prospective resources are set forth and are derived, in 
each case, from the GLJ resources assessment. The GLJ resources 
assessment was prepared in accordance with COGE handbook and NI 51-101 
by GLJ, an independent qualified reserve evaluator. All prospective 
resources evaluated in the GLJ resources assessment were deemed economic
 at the effective date of Dec. 31, 2017. Prospective resources are in 
addition to reserves estimated in the GLJ report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Upper Utica was 
considered undiscovered for approximately 84 per cent of the total 
mapped TPIIP. Recovery factors of 19 per cent, 27 per cent and 40 per 
cent were applied to the low, best and high estimates resource cases, 
respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A range of prospective resources estimates (low, best and high) were prepared by GLJ.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GLJ resources 
assessment estimated gross risked prospective resources of 87 million 
boe (low estimate) to 238 million boe (high estimate), with a best 
estimate of 143 million boe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chance of 
commerciality for prospective resources is equal to the product of the 
chance of discovery and the chance of development. Chance of discovery 
is the estimated probability that exploration activities will confirm 
the existence of a significant accumulation of potentially recoverable 
petroleum. Chance of development is the estimated probability that, once
 discovered, a known accumulation will be commercially developed. Based 
on contingencies related to the passage of applicable hydrocarbon and 
environmental legislation, regulations, local acceptability, and 
additional risk associated with securing <b>social licence</b> to 
operate, firm development plans, detailed cost estimates and corporate 
approvals GLJ estimated the chance of development at 19 per cent. 
Proximity to extensional and compressional-related fault systems 
presents risk of structuring resulting in leak off and reduced pressures
 in some prospective regions, additionally, lack of delineation data 
provides reservoir risk associated with uncertainty regarding reservoir 
quality and rock mechanics amicable to hydraulic fracturing. Therefore, 
GLJ has estimated the chance of discovery at 81 per cent. The 
corresponding chance of commerciality is 15 per cent. This also takes 
into account Questerre's working interest and operatorship of its assets
 as Questerre is subject to the priorities of working interest partners 
for such assets. Production and development forecasts were not completed
 by GLJ as part of the prospective resources evaluation.</p>

Notes 
Prospective resources are defined in the COGE handbook as those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, 
to be potentially recoverable from unknown accumulations by application of future development projects. Prospective 
resources have both an associated chance of discovery (CoDis) and a chance of development (CoDev). There is no 
certainty that any portion of the prospective resources will be discovered. If discovered, there is no certainty that 
it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the prospective resources or that Questerre will produce any 
portion of the volumes currently classified as prospective resources. The estimates of prospective resources involve 
implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the resources described exist in the quantities 
predicted or estimated, as at a given date, and that the resources can be profitably produced in the future. The 
risked net present value of the future net revenue from the prospective resources does not represent the fair market 
value of the prospective resources. Actual prospective resources (and any volumes that may be reclassified as 
reserves) and future production therefrom may be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein.
GLJ prepared the estimates of prospective resources shown for each property using deterministic principles and methods. 
Probabilistic aggregation of the low and high property estimates shown in the table might produce different total 
volumes than the arithmetic sums shown in the table.
The forecast price and cost assumptions utilized in the year-end 2017 reserves report were also utilized by GLJ in 
preparing the GLJ resource assessment.
Gross prospective resources are Questerre's working interest (operating or non-operating) share before deduction of 
royalties and without including any royalty interests of the company. Net prospective resources are Questerre's 
working interest (operating or non-operating) share after deduction of royalty obligations, plus Questerre's royalty 
interests in prospective resources.
The risked net present value of future net revenue attributable to the prospective resources does not represent the 
fair market value of the prospective resources. Estimated abandonment and reclamation costs have been included in 
the evaluation.
The low estimate prospective resources are considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity that will actually 
be recovered. It is likely that the actual net remaining quantities recovered will exceed the low estimate of 87 
million boe. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 90-per-cent probability (P90) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the low estimate.  
The best estimate prospective resources are considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will actually be 
recovered. It is equally likely that the actual net remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the 
best estimate of 143 million. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50-per-cent probability 
(P50) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the best estimate.
The high estimate prospective resources are considered to be an optimistic estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual net remaining quantities recovered will exceed the high 
estimate of 238 million boe. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 10-per-cent probability 
(P10) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the high estimate.
The chance of commerciality is defined as the product of the chance of discovery and the chance of development. 
Chance of discovery is defined in COGE handbook as the estimated probability that exploration activities will 
confirm the existence of a significant accumulation of potentially recoverable petroleum. Chance of development is 
defined as the estimated probability that, once discovered, a known accumulation will be commercially developed.

<span class="companylink">Blackbird Energy Inc</span>. will need to drill fewer wells than initially contemplated north of the Wapiti River in northwestern Alberta to meet its <b>gas</b> processing commitments for its liquids-rich lands at Pipestone, the company’s chief executive said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has just 
completed flaring its first well north of the river and plans to drill 
another five wells, down from the eight to 10 it had been considering, 
Garth Braun, president, CEO and chair of the board, told the company’s 
annual meeting. “This reduction is substantial,” he said. “It’s a 
capital reduction that really reduces the burden on Blackbird.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 reduced number of wells is based on the company’s analysis of 
adjourning wells in addition to its 3-27-71-7W6 well for which it will 
be announcing the results “imminently,” he said. “We are very 
optimistic.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 3-27 Upper Montney delineation well is approximately 14 kilometres north of Blackbird’s previous development drilling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That well and 
surrounding wells have given us the ability to look at the productivity 
of the resource in that area and to begin to model how many more wells 
we need to implement to meet our first commitment into Tidewater 
[Midstream and Infrastructure Ltd.],” said Braun. Test results will 
include reservoir pressure data as well as condensate-to-<b>gas</b> ratios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drilling would begin in 
July 2018 but would not be completed until later in advance of the 
Tidewater facility coming onstream in the&nbsp; the second quarter of 
2019, he said after the meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Braun told shareholders 
the company is focused on keeping its drilling and completion costs down
 to about $5.5 million to $5.6 million. As the company proceeds into pad
 development north of the Wapiti, it will attempt to keep costs below $6
 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to a 
question, he said Blackbird currently is evaluating how it plans to 
raise the capital needed for the development. In addition to a reserve 
based lending facility, it could look at possibly a drilling fund or a 
joint venture project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blackbird has entered into a <b>gas</b>
 processing agreement with Tidewater and is in the process of finalizing
 a gathering system agreement, the meeting heard. “The transaction that 
we have struck with Tidewater is transformative because it allows me to 
profitably increase [production] to 10,000 boe/d to 12,000 boe/d,” said 
Braun. “It also is the only facility that I am able to gain an option to
 obtain up to 20 per cent.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a small company such 
as Blackbird with 2,000 to 2,200 boe/d of production, the challenge was 
how it could profitably increase output in the early stages, he told 
shareholders. Braun said he had looked at other agreements and 
transactions he would have had to enter into but didn’t see they were 
viable until production was 40 mmcf/d to 50 mmc/d of <b>gas</b> in order to afford the transportation, compression and processing. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tidewater is to build a <b>gas</b> plant south of the Wapiti River to process Blackbird’s <b>gas</b>
 from north and south of the river. The two companies have agreed to an 
initial term of five years with firm capacity of 20 mmcf/d expected to 
be available in the second quarter of 2019, increasing to 25 mmcfd/d 12 
months after plant start-up and to 30 mmcf/d 18 months after plant 
start-up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blackbird currently has more than 4,800 boe/d of productive capacity, excluding its non-operated wells and the 3-27 well.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I am so excited about 
this deal and I am also excited [about] the way they operate because as 
they operate, we operate,” said Braun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tidewater will be 
building a gathering system to Blackbird’s compressor site, which it has
 already acquired, he said after the meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through Tidewater which will have multiple meters, Blackbird will have access to storage and buyers for its <b>gas</b>, he said. And while the midstreamer’s deepcut facility on the Alliance pipeline will reduce <b>gas</b> volumes as it strips out a deeper portion of the company’s <b>gas</b>, “I don’t mind having my <b>gas</b> shrunk,” said Braun, noting that it still meets Alliance specifications. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tidewater also will have one of the largest storage facilities for <b>gas</b> in northern Alberta at more than 100 bcf and will be one of the biggest buyers of natural <b>gas</b> likely for the next five years or so, he suggested. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Blackbird will continue to look at the Chicago market as a premium market for its natural <b>gas</b>, Braun said there is a risk that Marcellus <b>gas</b>
 could flood into the market and dilute it. “I think we have to look at 
what other markets we can penetrate and not just focus on Chicago with 
long-term contracts on Alliance.” &nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blackbird, though, does not want to dump its <b>gas</b> into the AECO market but to move it south, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the company has a strong ability to deliver <b>gas</b>, “we will immediately hedge.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blackbird has booked only
 nine per cent proved reserves and has significant lands in both its 
operated and non-operated areas that need to be re-reserved, said Braun.
 The company will be evaluating when it will implement its next reserve 
report and it’s highly likely it will do an updated reserves report, he 
said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That reserves report is 
key for [a] reserve-based lending facility,” said Braun. It also will be
 a part of the facility funding to develop Blackbird’s northern program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The key … is that we 
have been delineating two intervals where we clearly see that there are 
four areas that are developable,” he said. While the company has focused
 on the Upper and Middle Montney, at some point it likely will go after a
 Lower Montney where some of its peers having been getting exceptional 
results and which it also sees as productive, Braun told the meeting. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blackbird management estimates the company has more than 1,450 potential wells at four wells per interval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is focusing 
on the production of condensate with the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) 
forecasting demand of more than one million bbls/d of the product by 
2027, driven by the oilsands need for diluent, the meeting heard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Braun noted that on 
Wednesday Blackbird sold its condensate for C$74/bbl while Western 
Canada Select (WCS) was selling for $35.90/bbl. “That’s a significant 
benefit and in a marketplace that is challenged on <b>gas</b>, we 
positioned our company to be in a liquid-rich area and we are focused on
 a commodity that actually has a competitive advantage over the U.S.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2014, the junior 
has accessed significant capital and has proven that more than 114 
sections of its land are over-pressured, he said. “We are in a 
liquids-rich fairway and have already delineated two intervals.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Braun said that Blackbird
 is concerned about both extraction and its interaction with the 
community. It also is focused on operating in an environmentally 
sensitive manner.&nbsp; “And most important is what’s the <b>social licence</b> benefit we’re having.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a company imposes on a
 community, there has to be a secondary benefit back to it, he said. 
“That doesn’t mean I am just opening my cheque book and writing cheques;
 what it means is that there has to be a benefit back to the community.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pipestone battery was
 more than just a pilot project defining the liquids nature of the 
resource so that Blackbird could produce its wells, the meeting heard. 
“It was to demonstrate to the public that we could operate safely within
 the community,” said Braun. “We wanted to show this platform of safe 
operation and we could continue to develop this asset through this 
corridor.”</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last
 month, we learned from Scotiabank that lack of export pipeline capacity
 and the resulting discount on Canadian oil will cost the Canadian 
economy $15.6 billion a year, or nearly $43 million a day. That loss 
affects provincial and federal revenues as much as corporate income. We 
are all losing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also last month came the 
unveiling of the Trudeau government's new suite of policies for 
reviewing and approving major energy infrastructure projects, such as 
oil and <b>gas</b> pipelines.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So
 is there anything in the new rules that will address our 
$43-million-a-day leak to our Southern neighbour? Unfortunately, the 
answer appears to be no. The new process appears to further increase 
uncertainty for future pipeline proponents and investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the symbolic level, the messaging is problematic. When you replace an agency named the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board (NEB) </span>with
 a new agency named the Impact Assessment Agency (IAA), the message is 
clear: environmental impact is replacing economic benefit as Canada's 
primary policy focus when it comes to new energy projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The details are equally 
discouraging. The proposed changes broaden the number of criteria that a
 new pipeline must meet. These now include not just climate change and 
enhanced Aboriginal consultation, but also "the intersection of sex and 
gender with other identity factors." For a pipeline?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public access to panel 
hearings is also increased. Gone is the old rule that limited 
participation to individuals and groups "directly affected" by a 
proposed pipeline. Now anyone interested must be allowed to participate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This open-door policy 
will increase the opportunity for climate change activists - many of 
them heavily funded by American interests - to clog the hearing process 
with project-killing delays. These groups don't want better, safer 
pipelines. They want zero pipelines. And they know that if they cannot 
kill new pipeline projects directly, they can delay them to death with 
endless hearings, rule changes, consultations, environmental studies, 
and court challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were able to do this
 under the old rules, as the obituaries for Northern Gateway and Energy 
East attest. And they will certainly try to do it again under the new 
rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What explains this 
disappointing result? At one level, it is another example of the prime 
minister trying to have it both ways on climate change and energy 
development. He wants to go into next year's federal election with the 
message that he has struck a statesmanlike "balance" between these 
competing objectives. But implicit in this argument is the assumption - 
or more accurately, the delusion - that green virtue signals like carbon
 taxes and expensive renewables are going to buy "<b>social licence</b>" for the development and export of Canada's valuable oil and <b>gas</b> reserves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's high time to stop 
indulging that charade. We now have example after example of climate 
change activists declaring publicly that nothing Canada does to reduce 
our domestic CO2 emissions will change their resolute opposition to new 
export pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was shockingly clear
 in an interview that CBC's Power and Politics did with the American 
anti-oil activist Bill McKibbon the evening that Nebraska approved a 
routing for <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s Keystone XL pipeline. McKibbon is the founder of <span class="companylink">350.org</span>, one of largest and best funded climate change interest groups in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every Canadian should see
 thisinterview( 
http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1100225603963[http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1100225603963]
 ) for themselves, but here is a summary of the key exchanges:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interviewer: What common ground might you be able to find with the Alberta government?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McKibbon: At this point, a
 common ground can't be found... The only thing we can do is keep as 
much carbon in the ground as possible... Canada, a rich country, needs 
to keep that carbon safely underground...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interviewer: So you don't give this government any credit (for its climate change policies)?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McKibbon: Oh, I think 
they are doing a good job on the demand side... but there aren't enough 
Canadians for that to be a very big deal. The big deal is the huge pool 
of carbon that sits underneath Alberta, and that will dwarf whatever it 
is that Canada does with its own domestic emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not just the 
McKibbons of the world that are stating the obvious fact that, at two 
per cent of global emissions, what Canada does to reduce our domestic 
emissions is irrelevant to what happens globally. We are too small to 
matter. Our own homegrown McKibbon - David Suzuki - bluntly said the 
same thing recently. Delivering a speech at a Calgary's teachers 
convention, Suzuki declared: "I'm sorry Alberta, but we have to keep 
that fuel in the ground... The tar sands have to be shut down... No more
 infrastructure getting that stuff out - that means rails, pipelines, 
shipping. There's no point in investing in infrastructure when they're 
all going to be shut down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So much for <b>social licence</b>.
 As for the new Impact Assessment Agency, it's not likely to be very 
busy anyhow. Unless it is substantially amended to correct the problems 
identified above, it seems doubtful that any investors will be proposing
 a new pipeline in Canada. And don't act surprised when you learn that <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> - Canada's oldest and largest pipeline company - is already investigating moving its head office to Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And as for the $43 
million a day that we are losing, there's no end in sight. Some have 
compared our current dilemma to the National Energy Program, but at 
least then, Central Canadians benefited from the loss suffered by 
Western Canadians. This time, the Trudeau Liberals are giving $15.6 
billion a year to American consumers just to win the next election. No 
one in Canada benefits from NEP 2. We are all losing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questerre Energy Corp</span>. has entered into an agreement with an experienced operator to develop its 100-per-cent-owned acreage in the Kakwa area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, president and chief executive officer of Questerre, 
commented: "The first well at Kakwa North should spud next quarter, 
subject to rig availability. Given the strong condensate production and 
low sour content from nearby wells on our joint venture acreage we are 
looking forward to the results."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He further added: "With 
this joint venture we are developing our operated acreage and preserving
 capital primarily for Quebec. We are working on our Quebec clean <b>gas</b> pilot as we wait for the release of the final regulations later this spring."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The farm-in partner is an
 exploration and production company with extensive operating experience 
with the Montney formation in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subject to the terms of 
the agreement, the farm-in partner has the right to drill, complete, 
equip and tie in two horizontal wells targeting the Montney formation to
 earn a 50-per-cent interest in certain acreage held by Questerre at 
Kakwa North. The partner has the option to drill, complete, equip and 
tie in additional wells to earn a similar interest in other acreage held
 by Questerre at Kakwa North and Kakwa South. Questerre will hold a 
royalty interest in these initial wells and certain subsequent wells 
subject to standard payout provisions. Questerre currently holds a 
100-per-cent interest in 4,480 acres at Kakwa North along with 3,840 
acres at Kakwa South and a 25-per-cent interest in 10,240 acres on its 
joint venture block.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questerre also reported 
on plans for additional activity targeting its shallow mineral rights, 
above and excluding Montney rights, at Kakwa North. The company was 
recently advised by the operator that it plans to drill up to six 
horizontal wells on this acreage in 2018. Questerre holds an overriding 
royalty interest in 4,160 acres of shallow rights at Kakwa North.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHALK RIVER, Ontario, Feb. 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <span class="companylink">Canadian Nuclear Laboratories</span>
 (CNL), Canada’s premier nuclear science and technology organization, 
and the Canadian Nuclear Society (CNS), Canada’s leading learned society
 representing over 1,000 nuclear scientists, researchers, engineers and 
professionals, announced today that they will partner to launch the 
first international Generation IV and Small Reactor Conference (G4SR), a
 global forum on the future of nuclear energy.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Held
 from November 6 - 8 at the Marriott Hotel Ottawa, G4SR seeks to build 
on the growing momentum and international interest in advanced and small
 modular reactor (SMR) development in Canada. The three-day conference 
promises engaging workshops, plenary sessions, and technical program 
tracks exploring topics critical to the design, development and 
deployment of Generation IV and small reactors, and brings together 
world leaders in technical and non-technical aspects of deployment for 
discussions relevant not just to Canada, but globally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Earlier this year we 
declared small modular reactors as one of seven strategic initiatives 
CNL intends to pursue as part of our Long-Term Strategy, with the 
specific goal of siting an SMR on one of our sites by 2026,” declared 
Dr. Kathy McCarthy, Vice-President of Research &amp; Development at CNL.
 “We believe in the commercial viability of SMRs, and it is our vision 
to serve as a global leader in SMR demonstration, testing and technology
 development support. Success in achieving this goal requires the 
critical connections that will be formed through the dialogue at events 
such as G4SR.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">G4SR comes at an exciting
 and important time for new nuclear technologies. The next generation of
 advanced reactors and SMRs hold the promise of low-carbon energy 
innovation for Canada and the world. Advanced SMRs are being designed 
with consideration for deployment in remote or off-grid locations, and 
have applications beyond the production of electricity, including 
desalination, hydrogen production, local area heating and process heat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This conference will 
invite thought leaders to weigh in on key questions on SMR deployment, 
including first-of-a-kind prototype testing; SMR manufacturing and the 
supply chain; economic benefits for the North; the challenges obtaining 
the <b>social licence</b> for deployment; possible integrations for 
renewables; and the long term waste management. From a business 
perspective, G4SR will delve into discussions around innovative public /
 private partnership business models as a mechanism to enable SMR 
investments; and takes a big picture look at the relationship between 
international development and small and advanced reactor designs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Generation IV and SMRs 
can play an important role in addressing the energy, health, safety, 
security and climate-change goals of the world,” declared Mr. Daniel 
Gammage, CNS President, “These reactors have advanced passive safety 
features, are resistant to nuclear proliferation, have no greenhouse <b>gas</b>
 emissions, and are promoted as being economically competitive . They 
are suitable for niche and off-grid applications, as well as a 
connection to the electrical grid as a supply option to provide 
incremental capacity as needed to match incremental energy demand.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As SMR vendors, and 
industry stakeholders, including CNL, work to advance SMR technologies 
from the design concept to laboratory testing, licencing and on through 
to deployment, there will be challenges; G4SR is an international forum 
for the industry and stakeholders to work together to identify obstacles
 and opportunities, and seek solutions through dialogue, engagement and 
collaboration. All interested parties are invited to attend and join us 
in the discussions.</p>

 you want to understand the depths of opposition to the Trans Mountain 
pipeline in British Columbia, listen for a moment to the former co-chair
 of Alberta's oilsands advisory committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tzeporah Berman, a B.C. 
environmental activist who once compared the oilsands to the mythical 
wasteland of Mordor, says there is nothing Alberta can do to make the 
$7.4-billion pipeline acceptable.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She calls Premier Rachel Notley's embargo on B.C. wine "petty."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She doesn't believe the pipeline expansion will increase provincial revenues by $1.5 billion annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the former <span class="companylink">Greenpeace</span> campaigner doesn't think Alberta's climate plan - establishing a carbon tax and capping greenhouse <b>gas</b> emissions from the oilsands - was part of any grand bargain to increase <b>social licence</b> and help get a new pipeline built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I just don't buy the premise even that we need another pipeline to tidewater," Berman said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't think this pipeline makes sense ... so I don't think the Alberta government can fix that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Berman's comments don't 
reflect all British Columbians - polls last fall showed a majority 
supported the project - but they are a sign of how polarized the debate 
over <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s pipeline has become, and how far Alberta still has to go to see the project through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also shows how little 
credit Alberta receives from staunch pipeline opponents for the 
significant steps it has taken to address climate change, even from 
those who know and understand how the plan works.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trudeau and Notley 
governments both insist the Trans Mountain expansion will be built, 
tripling the amount of Alberta oil that can move to the Pacific coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It won't be done without a fight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Berman, who helped 
organize the War in the Woods antilogging campaign in the early 1990s, 
wrote on social media this month that "conflict is messy and unpleasant 
but looking necessary" in reference to Trans Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If they break ground, 
then there is no question that hundreds, if not thousands, will stand up
 to oppose them," Berman said when asked about the tweet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Nobody likes conflict. 
I've been to jail and it's not a pleasant place and I'm not looking 
forward to going back there. But we'll do what it takes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such tough talk has 
escalated in recent weeks with the B.C. government's proposal to limit 
the amount of bitumen moving from Alberta into the western province by 
pipeline or rail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pipelines that cross 
provincial borders, such as Trans Mountain, fall under federal 
authority. Ottawa has approved the project and signalled it will respond
 to any attempt by B.C. to infringe upon federal powers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley has retaliated by boycotting B.C. wines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the west coast, Berman
 said Notley's wine embargo has backfired, broadening the national and 
international campaign against the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's petty and small, and it's doing the exact opposite of what she would have hoped," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's easy to discount 
such hardline views, although it's worth recalling that, until last 
year, Berman had the ear of government and served as one of the cochairs
 on the Alberta Oil Sands Advisory Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, she openly 
talked about the need for environmentalists and industry officials to 
sit down and "get out of this full-out conflict."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The committee helped develop a policy to limit the amount of greenhouse <b>gas</b>
 emissions coming from the oilsands at 100 megatonnes annually. By 
reducing their emissions per barrel, oilsands producers should be able 
to stay under the limit and increase output well into the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environment Minister 
Shannon Phillips said recently the panel heard from a number of 
different perspectives as Alberta was trying to develop sound policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about Berman's tweet, Phillips bluntly replied: "I'm really not all that concerned about anything Tzeporah Berman says."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside the other camp, 
Berman said she and other environmentalists supported Alberta's climate 
plan as a good first step and still backs the emissions cap, but 
stresses it must be reviewed and lowered over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And all that still isn't going to win support for the Trans Mountain project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The climate plan that the Alberta government put in place has increased <b>social licence</b>
 to a certain extent ... It was a false premise to assume that that, 
therefore, means it was a bargain for a pipeline," Berman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Demanding crass 
political trade-offs, instead of allowing projects and policies to stand
 on their own merit, is a mistake. It wasn't going to work from the 
beginning and it's not working now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's strategy with 
carbon pricing and the emission cap was "significant action," designed 
to undercut the climate change arguments that fuelled opposition to the 
oilsands and pipelines, said energy economist Jennifer Winter from the <span class="companylink">University of Calgary</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In part, it worked. Prime
 Minister Justin Trudeau cited Alberta's initiatives when he approved 
the Trans Mountain project in late 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the pipeline is now a
 year behind schedule and facing new obstacles. Concerns in B.C. focus 
on spill response and the potential environmental impact of such an 
event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For some groups, the action Alberta takes will never be enough, aside from shutting down the oilsands," said Winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the energy 
industry's perceptive, Berman's comments reflect the ideology driving 
the opposition and the fact the goalposts will always move, regardless 
of what steps they take.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the most 
irritating element of all this is just how little credit Alberta is 
getting for the action it has taken, an energyproducing jurisdiction 
willing to put a cap on emissions from a growing industrial sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Tim McMillan, CEO of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, 
said the implacable stance by Berman runs counter to her earlier 
comments about working together to construct policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is angering to have her now say, 'There is no scenario where I would accept your industry being successful,'" he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For her, today, to be 
campaigning against something that would be so important to Canada is 
frustrating and makes people angry."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's plenty of anger in the pipeline debate today, but that shouldn't change the outcome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project was deemed to be in the national interest. Alberta has done its part.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, it's time for Ottawa
 to do the same, regardless of the noise from the other side. Chris

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 NDP government in British Columbia has thrown yet another shoe in the 
gears of Canadian provincial comity with a declaration that B.C. will 
create a new provincial regulatory process for pipeline approval, and 
will restrict how much bitumen can be moved through pipelines into B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government, led by 
Premier John Horgan, also announced it will create its own "independent 
scientific panel" to evaluate B.C.'s ability to deal with potential 
spills, potentially tacking on another two-year delay for the Kinder 
Morgan Trans Mountain expansion pipeline. Apparently, in the eyes of the
 B.C. government, the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>, which has overseen pipeline operations and cleanups for 28 years, is not up to the task.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Alberta Premier Rachel Notley responded immediately and called the 
proposed actions illegal, unconstitutional and mere "political 
game-playing and political theatre."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horgan's response? Basically, we'll see you in court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley also recently 
cancelled negotiations of a planned purchase of electric power from 
B.C., and removed B.C. wine imports in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are three ways to 
look at B.C.'s actions: a) as a partial rejection of federal control 
over transportation infrastructure and use; b) as paralysis-by-analysis 
that can drag out the "review" process long enough to cause investor 
flight; and c) as a repudiation of the Notley/Trudeau plan to buy "<b>social licence</b>" for pipelines with an aggressive show of climate-policy implementation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first instance, 
B.C.'s action is clearly a challenge to federal jurisdiction over 
transportation. But as law professor Dwight Newman observes, Canada's 
Constitution is crystal clear on this point, putting interprovincial 
transportation in the exclusive domain of the federal government. This 
aspect of the Constitution, Newman notes, has been affirmed in numerous 
court cases including a 1954 Supreme Court case (Campbell-Bennett v. 
Comstock Midwestern).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newman makes a powerful 
argument that, absent the constitutional principles that give Ottawa 
control over interprovincial transportation of all sorts, there "very 
possibly would have been no national railways, and no Canada to speak 
of."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the second case, 
B.C.'s actions can be seen as a tactic to slow the proposed Trans 
Mountain expansion, increase its cost and uncertainty, and potentially 
change the economics of the project. We have seen this play out before, 
when Trans Canada cancelled its plans for the Energy East and Eastern 
Mainline pipeline projects due to additional red tape announced by the 
Trudeau government. Also last month, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 reiterated that if the Trans Mountain project continues to face 
"unreasonable regulatory risk" it may not proceed with building the 
pipeline. It's a well-known tactic of energy obstructionists: if you 
can't block oilsands production, blockade paths to markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, the B.C. 
government's action is a hard slap at Notley's plans to essentially buy 
off pipeline opponents with an explosion of climate change policies, 
which include banning coal-power generation, escalating carbon taxes, 
hard caps on carbon-emission reductions, additional limits on air 
emissions from the oil and <b>gas</b> sector, and more spending on every
 "green dream" on the wish list of pipeline opponents. Money will flow 
to more electric car subsidies, renewable energy mandates and subsidies,
 even a new agency specifically focused on energy efficiency programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And what has she 
purchased for Albertans with this massive increase in tax-and-spend 
governance? Federal approval of two pipelines, with almost zero buy-in 
from opponents of pipeline construction, including B.C.'s NDP 
government. The only question is how long will Notley continue to try to
 buy the un-buyable at the expense of Alberta taxpayers? With its latest
 moves, B.C.'s NDP government (propped up by the Green Party) has shown 
it does not respect federal authority over transportation infrastructure
 in Canada, and demonstrated a blatant disregard for the economic 
well-being of Albertans (while gladly using the gasoline and aviation 
fuel Alberta sells). B.C. is treating Alberta like a trading partner to 
be blockaded on a whim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.C. is already the lowestranked Canadian jurisdiction for investment in oil and <b>gas</b> in the <span class="companylink">Fraser Institute</span>'s annual survey of upstream oil and <b>gas</b>
 executives. Now, in addition to likely cementing its back-of-the-pack 
status for investment, B.C.'s government has badly weakened 
interprovincial relations, challenged federal regulatory authority, and 
revealed that the concept of public approval is nothing but a pipe

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The clash between B.C. and Alberta goes a lot deeper than the current headlines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least 10 or 20 years 
of ruthlessly organized, internationally endowed, wildly overblown scare
 propaganda against the Canadian oil industry, most especially as 
symbolized by the Fort McMurray oilsands project, has preceded it. The 
shielding umbrella under which the campaign has been waged, and the 
spurious ideological warrant behind it, has been the global warming 
fetish that locates the Earth's imminent doom in the industrial 
economies of modern capitalism. Its foot soldiers have been a tormented 
assembly of every hard left groupuscule from the trendy Chavistas (Naomi
 Klein Inc.) to the fatuous (Bill Nye) to the grimly Calvinist Greens. 
At both ends they are an angry and a zealous lot, unscrupulous in their 
messaging and remorselessly uncompromising in their aims: shut down oil,
 cost to the world be damned.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta,
 in particular, has been their toy. They have had 20 years to spread the
 message that Alberta's oil, and Fort McMurray in deep particular, are 
both trigger and emblem of the coming catastrophe, that the hundreds of 
thousands who toil in the oilsands are as the orcs of Mordor moving ever
 closer to returning the Earth to Darkness and working Nature's ruin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No other state or 
province, and no other single project has borne the weight of calumny 
and accusation as have Alberta and Fort McMurray. No campaigns against 
projects in China, India, the Middle East, the U.S. or Latin America 
have been of even near duration or intensity as their relentless crusade
 against the oilsands and Fort McMurray. The oilsands are as a pinprick 
in the world's energy production, yet as the eco Furies paint them, they
 are Armageddon's launch pad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When, despite protest, 
propaganda, misrepresentation and chronic interference, the oilsands 
project did move ahead, when, despite the "infinite regress" (C. Cosh) 
of environmental assessment and reassessment, it lurched to production, 
clearly novel tactics had to be summoned, the campaign reframed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enter the pipeline 
frenzy. The innocent pipeline as Destroyer of Worlds. Once oil was there
 to be delivered, there arose the intractable opposition to every and 
any pipeline, turned to any point of the compass, within Canada or 
outside, coming out of Alberta. The professional petrophobes had failed 
to keep the oil in the ground; now they determined to landlock it in 
Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They couldn't stop the oil from being harvested, so they would turn Alberta into an energy jail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delay and obstruction are
 activists'favoured munitions, as seen in so many other pipelines and 
projects. Petronas and its $36-billion project was procrastinated into 
oblivion. Energy East was cancelled over ever-extended regulations. 
Stall, freeze, regulate, litigate, occupy and demonstrate - anything 
that slows progress or jams an operation - if it's the oilsands, all's 
on the table. Obama speciously dawdled for his whole two terms on 
Keystone. Fortunately, on that one Mr. Trump was more prompt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tactics change, the 
game remains the same - stop Alberta and its "toxic" world-ruinous 
oilsands. It is in this context we should view recent events, and the 
emergence of the Alberta-B.C. clash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two decades of incessant 
campaign and propaganda have had a cumulative effect - an abiding weight
 of preconception and indisposition against any fair reading of 
Alberta's dilemma. It lubricates the singular and farcical association 
of the oilsands and the Green nightmare of CO2 doom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it supplies the 
backdrop for the political manoeuvring of B.C. Premier John Horgan and 
his Green Council of Three, the shameless demand for yet another 
environmental assessment - the most transparent political ploy since 
Dalton McGuinty in Ontario cancelled two <b>gas</b> plants to leverage an election vote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It should also work to 
remind people that when Mr. Trudeau endlessly parrots the formula of the
 "balance between the environment and the economy" it is not a balance 
he has any personal familiarity or experience with. On how many of his 
incessant travels has he spoken up for Alberta's industry, or, equally 
to the point, condemned the concert of environmental groups making a 
career out of opposition to Alberta? He has had the choice of venues and
 the world's ear. How many times even within Canada? Has there even been
 one national address on Alberta's plight - after the price downturn, 
after the inferno that ravaged Fort McMurray, after the fight of capital
 and companies from the oilsands? No. Contrast that with his 
interminable rhapsodies on carbon taxes and climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so it is that with the latest salvo from B.C., Premier Rachel Notley pushes on alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She may have thought she had a deal with Justin Trudeau on "<b>social licence</b>"
 but she never did - just a treacle of insincere bromides, verbal goo to
 serve a moment's press, forgotten before the camera lights dimmed. Her 
erstwhile partner in "the balance" hovers blandly above the contest, 
even as a fracture in the Confederation threatens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, the Trudeau 
government has approved the pipeline. Mr. Trudeau has said so himself as
 recently as Thursday in San Francisco. How lethargic though are his 
iterations of that approval, passionless to the point of coma. Where's 
his presence on the issue? Where's the prime ministerial voice on its 
relation to the national interest? Where's his rebuke to the 
grandstanding in B.C.? He's been stronger lobbying Jeff Bezos on Amazon 
for Toronto than the country or the world on the oilsands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A province that fed the 
national economy during rough times is having rough times itself. Return
 the favour, serve the national interest, and declare the time for 
obstruction, assessments and political theatre is over. Alberta should 
not have to keep selling its resource at a blinding discount because the
 prime minister shivers over the thought of a backlash from <span class="companylink">Greenpeace</span>, <span class="companylink">World Wildlife Fund</span>, or a frown from the one-member, one-cause party in the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trudeau government it
 is clear, from the mouth of its leader, and the cast of its advisers, 
and the character of its ministers on this file, devotes far more 
sympathy to those who warn of oil, fear global collapse and participate 
in global campaigns against it, than the opposite. They are ParisPeople 
more than CalgaryPeople, more Rio than Fort Mac. The IPCC will never 
convene in Edmonton.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">British
 Columbia has thrown yet another shoe in the gears of Canadian 
provincial comity with a declaration that B.C. will create a new 
provincial regulatory process for pipeline approval, and will restrict 
how much bitumen can be moved through pipelines into B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier John Horgan has 
also announced an "independent scientific panel" to evaluate B.C.'s 
ability to deal with potential spills, potentially tacking on another 
two-year delay for the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain expansion pipeline. 
Apparently, in the eyes of the B.C. government, the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>, which has overseen pipeline operations and cleanups for 28 years, is not up to the task.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier Rachel Notley immediately called the proposed actions illegal, unconstitutional and mere "political theatre."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horgan's response? 
Basically, we'll see you in court. Notley also recently cancelled 
negotiations of a planned purchase of electricity from B.C., and removed
 B.C. wine imports in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are three ways to 
look at B.C.'s actions: a) as a partial rejection of federal control 
over transportation infrastructure; b) as paralysis-by-analysis that can
 drag out the "review" process long enough to cause investor flight; and
 c) as a repudiation of the Notley/Trudeau plan to buy "<b>social licence</b>" for pipelines with an aggressive show of climate-policy implementation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first instance, 
B.C.'s action is clearly a challenge to federal jurisdiction over 
transportation. But as law professor Dwight Newman observes, Canada's 
Constitution is crystal clear on this point, putting interprovincial 
transportation in the exclusive domain of the federal government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newman makes a powerful 
argument that, absent the constitutional principles that give Ottawa 
control over interprovincial transportation of all sorts, there "very 
possibly would have been no national railways, and no Canada to speak 
of."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the second case, 
B.C.'s actions can be seen as a tactic to slow the proposed Trans 
Mountain expansion, increase its cost and uncertainty, and potentially 
change the economics of the project. We have seen this play out before, 
when Trans Canada cancelled its plans for the Energy East and Eastern 
Mainline pipeline projects due to additional red tape announced by the 
Trudeau government. Also last month, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 reiterated that if the Trans Mountain project continues to face 
"unreasonable regulatory risk" it may not proceed with building the 
pipeline. It's a well-known tactic of energy obstructionists: if you 
can't block oilsands production, blockade paths to markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, the B.C. 
government's action is a hard slap at Notley's plans to essentially buy 
off pipeline opponents with an explosion of climate change policies, 
which include banning coal-power generation, escalating carbon taxes, 
hard caps on carbonemission reductions, additional limits on air 
emissions from the oil and <b>gas</b> sector, and more spending on every
 "green dream" on the wishlist of pipeline opponents. Money will flow to
 more electric car subsidies, renewable energy mandates and subsidies, 
even a new agency specifically focused on energy efficiency programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And what has she 
purchased for Albertans with this massive increase in tax-and-spend 
governance? Federal approval of two pipelines, with almost zero buy-in 
from opponents, including B.C.'s NDP government. The only question is 
how long will Notley continue to try and buy the un-buyable? With its 
latest moves, B.C.'s NDP government has shown it does not respect 
federal authority and demonstrated a blatant disregard for the economic 
well-being of Albertans (while gladly using the gasoline and aviation 
fuel Alberta sells). B.C. is treating Alberta like a trading partner to 
be blockaded on a whim. B.C. is already the lowestranked Canadian 
jurisdiction for investment in oil and <b>gas</b> in the <span class="companylink">Fraser Institute</span>'s annual survey of upstream oil and <b>gas</b>
 executives. Now, in addition to likely cementing its back-of-the-pack 
status for investment, B.C.'s government has badly weakened 
inter-provincial relations, challenged federal regulatory authority, and
 revealed that the concept of public approval is nothing but a pipe 
dream. Kenneth Green is senior director of the Centre for Natural 
Resource Studies at the <span class="companylink">Fraser Institute</span>.</p>

 — Nova Scotia's premier moved Thursday to clarify remarks he made to a 
business audience about the province's ban on hydraulic fracturing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this week, Stephen McNeil told the Halifax Chamber of Commerce that if a community decides it will give a "<b>social licence</b>" to initiate fracking, the province would be "happy to join them."</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The premier appeared to be signalling his intention to eventually lift the ban, but on Thursday he dialled back his response.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Let me be clear, there 
has obviously been some confusion," he said following a cabinet meeting.
 "We have no intention of changing the position of the province at this 
point."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McNeil said that if any 
community brings forward a broad consensus on the possibility of 
fracking in their area, his government would look at the information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, he said the 
province has no plans to hold consultations, adding that it would be up 
to communities or private companies to hold public consultations if they
 are interested in doing so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The premier said the government would then consider how to proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We would obviously listen with the community and then we would have to make a decision as a government," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NDP Leader Gary Burrill 
said there are now clear demarcations on where the three main political 
parties stand on the ban. He said the Progressive Conservatives are 
"wildly enthusiastic" about fracking, while his party "wants nothing to 
do with the fracking business whatsoever."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Liberal Party talks 
out of both sides of their mouth," said Burrill. "They bring in a 
legislated ban but they don't enact ... and they say one thing to one 
audience and another to another audience somewhere else."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals passed legislation banning fracking in 2014, but have not proclaimed it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government recently released an Energy Department analysis that listed the economic potential of onshore natural <b>gas</b> at between US$20-billion and US$60-billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analysis, known as 
the Nova Scotia Onshore Petroleum Atlas, estimates the province is 
sitting on about seven trillion cubic feet of hydrocarbons when 
conventional natural <b>gas</b> reserves are included.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About US$40 billion of that potential exists in shale <b>gas</b>, which would require hydraulic fracturing to extract it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McNeil played down a 
recent letter from Guysborough County Council that asked for a 
reconsideration of the ban, saying it will take more than a council 
vote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The onshore atlas 
doesn't show that there's any product at all in Guysborough," he said. 
"The (council) can be interested but it would be the community."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Energy Department 
later confirmed in an email that it had received correspondence from 
Guysborough, but it would only say that, "We're working on a response to
 the letter."</p>

 regulate interprovincial pipelines is the federal cabinet. She demanded
 Trudeau make that clear to B.C. Premier John Horgan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is not a dispute between B.C. and Alberta, it is a dispute between B.C. and Canada," Notley told reporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley said unless

speculate if he was being pushed around by the anti-pipeline Green party
 that holds the balance of power in B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She managed to almost put
 a smile on her face at times during the news conference. You could call

 should be taking a harder line with the B.C. government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, Notley said 
her government has suspended negotiations on buying hydro power from 
B.C., a move that could cost that province $500 million a year in sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Notley even suggested
 in a roundabout way she'll find ways for Albertans to boycott B.C. "Our
 government is looking at ways in which we might be able to provide 
additional tools to Albertans who would like to engage in that activity 
in a more wholesale way."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You get the impression 
that if Alberta and B.C. were sovereign nations, Notley would be 
withdrawing our ambassador to Victoria and ordering our troops to the 
border.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">War would be imminent. But as two provinces in a peaceful confederation, there's only so much Notley can do to retaliate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She has rejected what is pretty much the nuclear option, to turn off the energy taps to B.C. That's what Kenney would like.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Let B.C. consumers see what sky-high <b>gas</b> prices look like," he said. He is no doubt voicing the opinion of many frustrated Albertans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley said that would hurt Alberta industry and open up the province to complaints under trade agreements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Notley really wants 
is for Trudeau to simply do his job as prime minister.

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In
 the 2015 election, Albertans clearly voted for change. But after nearly
 two and a half years of this new government, how would voters grade the
 NDP's energy strategy? With the price of oil at a threeyear high, 
Albertans may not realize that we're not reaping all the benefits of the
 recent uptick. In fact, the opposite is happening: the price 
differential between what the market price is and what Canadian oil and <b>gas</b> producers get for their product is increasing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is there a price 
differential? Well, because Canada lacks the necessary energy 
infrastructure to get its oil products to new markets we're left selling
 our product to one customer: the United States. As a result, American 
buyers of Canadian oil receive a steep discount. The difference in the 
price of Western Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Western Canadian Select 
(WCS) is known as the price differential.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According
 to the Economics Dashboard at the Government of Alberta, "the 
differential of WTI over WCS was US$11.02 in November 2017." An $11 
differential on already-low oil prices means lost revenue (in the form 
of taxes and royalties) for an NDP government that is already drowning 
in debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week that differential grew to roughly $30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the NDP, Alberta 
appears no closer to closing the price differential gap. We are now 
saddled with a costly carbon tax, while other jurisdictions continuously
 try to kill approved pipeline projects worth billions in investment and
 employment for Albertans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP never campaigned 
on the carbon tax yet announced it just months after assuming office. 
With no mandate to impose a carbon tax, the NDP needed to justify this 
astronomical tax increase through other means. They told Albertans that a
 multibillion dollar tax on virtually everything was necessary to secure
 the so-called '<b>social licence</b>'for pipelines - the same pipelines needed to close the gap on the oil price differential! After two and a half years of '<b>social licence</b>,'it's
 clear the NDP didn't do their homework. During that time, we've seen 
the federal and provincial government pile on additional jobkilling 
regulations and taxes, like the NDP's new industrial carbon regulations 
and the combined provincial-federal carbon tax increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unswayed by the supposed benefits of carbon taxes, the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>
 added up-and-downstream emissions tests to its assessment of future 
energy projects. In addition to being a clear violation of provincial 
jurisdiction, the federal government's overreach will kill future 
investment in Alberta's oil and <b>gas</b> sector. <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>
 blamed the new federal emissions tests when they killed their own 
$16-billion Energy East project, politely citing a review of "changed 
circumstances." Sadly, Alberta's NDP remains muted in the face of these 
changes implemented by the Trudeau Liberals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, our biggest customer, the United States, is now our biggest competitor: they've become a net exporter of <b>gas</b>; they're also enjoying record oil production numbers while building liquid natural <b>gas</b>
 export terminals. And they did all of this within the same low-price 
environment that we currently find ourselves in. Canada's oil and <b>gas</b> sector is flat while the U.S. is prospering because of policy, not price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless of what your opinion of the petroleum industry is, Alberta's oil and <b>gas</b>
 sector is critical to everyone in this province. The resource belongs 
to us, the people of Alberta. And we deserve to get fair market value 
for our resource precisely because this is how we pay for our valuable 
public services. Right now we're losing billions in revenue while 
borrowing to pay for schools, hospitals, and other critical 
infrastructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, we want 
Alberta's industry to succeed, and a United Conservative government 
would enact grassroots-approved policies that send a clear message to 
job-creators: Alberta is once again open for business. And we think 
those signals will propel Alberta to the head of the class.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, I'm giving the NDP a failing grade. Prasad Panda is the United Conservative MLA for Calgary-Foothills</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier Notley, here's a tip: <b>Social licence</b> is utterly, completely, entirely, totally USELESS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If ever more proof were 
needed, it came Tuesday with the announcement by B.C.'s NDP government 
that it was going to restrict bitumen shipments across its territory 
until it can conduct further "scientific" reviews into the safety of 
pipelines and the ability of pipeline companies to clean up leaks.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This
 is politicking - plain and simple - by the west coast cousins of our 
New Democrats. It's no more scientific than astrology. Still, it could 
easily delay the Trans Mountain pipeline extension for months, or kill 
it altogether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it shreds any credibility the Alberta NDP's "<b>social licence</b>" theory had left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the nearly three years
 since the Alberta NDP became our provincial lgunter@postmedia.com 
government, they have dismantled the Alberta Advantage. (Frankly, 
they've run over the Alberta Advantage with a bulldozer, then backed up 
and run over it again, just to make sure it was dead.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They killed it in order to buy something they call "<b>social licence</b>."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Social licence</b> is a
 sort of fuzzy concept in which we spend billions to show 
environmentalists and other provinces'"green" politicians that we are 
committed to guarding against climate change. In return, they allow us 
to build pipelines to Canada's east and west coasts so our oilsands 
bitumen can reach refineries and ports, and ultimately international 
markets, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many people have warned 
the NDP that environmentalists aren't worried about pipelines, per se, 
but rather what's in them - namely fossil fuels that will produce carbon
 emissions when burned. So nothing the NDP do - no matter how expensive 
or socialist - is ever going to buy enviros'or ecopoliticians' favour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, Premier 
Notley and her party have imposed a carbon tax that has made nearly 
every good and service in the province more expensive. Natural <b>gas</b>, for instance, costs 25 per cent more than it did when the NDP came to power, solely because of the Notley carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP are prematurely 
shutting down our coal-fired power plants, too. This will cost Alberta 
taxpayers as much as $4 billion (maybe more). The money is for buyouts 
to the utilities that own the plants and subsidies to cover the enormous
 cost of replacement electricity from alternate sources, such as wind 
and solar power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have imposed a cap on emissions from the oilsands, which acts as a backhanded limit on new oilsands development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before the carbon 
tax, they had increased emission taxes on Alberta's 700 largest carbon 
dioxideemitting companies. And they jacked up corporate and upper-income
 tax rates by as much as 50 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this has driven away tens of billions in new oil and <b>gas</b> investment in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the NDP, Alberta was 14th of 96 places in the world to invest in oil and <b>gas</b>. Now it is in the mid-40s and undoubtedly falling like a stone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short, the NDP have 
made Alberta a poor place to do energy business. They have made a bad 
recession deeper - and prolonged it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And what gain have we earned from all this pain? Not a single centimetre of new pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's obvious what B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier John Horgan and his NDP government are trying to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his federal Liberals created such a regulatory nightmare for <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>
 that the company finally threw up its hands and walked away from the 
$15.7-billion Energy East pipeline, our NDP's close, close friends in 
B.C. are hoping they can roadblock Trans Mountain long enough that <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> gives up in disgust, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then Alberta will have a no Advantage, a mountain of debt, high taxes, chronic underemployment, slow growth and NO PIPELINES.</p>

have been experts at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No doubt the Tories 
needed a thorough trouncing to clean out the deadwood (and encourage 
them to reunite the right). Nevertheless, they didn't lack economists

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were defeated by

dim-wittedness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But because the

than our own, as we see the Notley government spending billions of our

factors relevant to the estimate of Pulse's contingent resources from 
the Bigoray EOR project include success of miscible flood development in

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resource Definitions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resources encompasses all
 petroleum quantities that originally existed on or within the earth's 
crust in naturally occurring accumulations, including Discovered and 
Undiscovered (recoverable and unrecoverable) plus quantities already 
produced. "Total Resources" is equivalent to "Total Petroleum Initially 
In-Place". Resources are classified in the following categories:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total Petroleum Initially
 In-Place ("TPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is estimated to 
exist originally in naturally occurring accumulations. It includes that 
quantity of petroleum that is estimated, as of a given date, to be 
contained in known accumulations, prior to production, plus those 
estimated quantities in accumulations yet to be discovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovered Petroleum 
Initially In-Place ("DPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is 
estimated, as of a given date, to be contained in known accumulations 
prior to production. The recoverable portion of DPIIP includes 
production, reserves, and Contingent Resources; the remainder is 
unrecoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources are 
those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established 
technology or technology under development but which are not currently 
considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more 
contingencies. Economic Contingent Resources (ECR) are those contingent 
resources that are currently economically recoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undiscovered Petroleum 
Initially In Place ("UPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is 
estimated, on a given date, to be contained in accumulations yet to be 
discovered. The recoverable portion of UPIIP is referred to as 
Prospective Resources and the remainder is unrecoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective Resources are
 those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application 
of future development projects. Prospective Resources have both an 
associated chance of discovery and a chance of development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unrecoverable is that 
portion of DPIIP and UPIIP quantities which is estimated, as of a given 
date, not to be recoverable by future development projects. A portion of
 these quantities may become recoverable in the future as commercial 
circumstances change or technological developments occur; the remaining 
portion may never be recovered due to the physical/chemical constraints 
represented by subsurface interaction of fluids and reservoir rocks. 
Uncertainty Ranges are described by the Canadian Oil and <b>Gas</b> Evaluation Handbook as low, best, and high estimates for reserves and resources as follows:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low Estimate: This is 
considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities
 recovered will exceed the low estimate. If probabilistic methods are 
used, there should be at least a 90 percent probability (P90) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the low estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best Estimate: This is 
considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will actually be
 recovered. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities 
recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate. If 
probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50 percent 
probability (P50) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or 
exceed the best estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High Estimate: This is 
considered to be an optimistic estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual remaining 
quantities recovered will exceed the high estimate. If probabilistic 
methods are used, there should be at least a 10 percent probability 
(P10) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the 
high estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development Unclarified 
is a project maturity sub-class of contingent resources that refers to 
the development plan evaluation is not complete and there is ongoing 
activity to resolve any risks or uncertainties.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certain resource estimate
 volumes disclosed herein are arithmetic sums of multiple estimates of 
DPIIP or UPIIP, which statistical principles indicate may be misleading 
as to volumes that may actually be recovered. Readers should give 
attention to the estimates of individual classes of resources and 
appreciate the differing probabilities of recovery associated with each 
class as explained under this&nbsp;Resource Definitions&nbsp;section.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta Advantage is dead and the Notley NDP killed it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley's taxes, fees, 
regulations and emission controls have scared away tens of billions in 
investment. But if the Alberta Advantage was still alive on New Year's 
Day, the 50 per cent increase in the carbon tax finished it off.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider
 this, in the middle of the one of the coldest cold spells in years, the
 New Democrats'carbon tax nearly doubles the cost of the natural <b>gas</b> most Albertans use to heat their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost three-quarters of Albertans heat their homes with natural <b>gas</b>, the highest percentage of any province. Rich Albertans, middle-class Albertans, lower-income Albertans, we all use it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That makes a carbon tax ultra regressive (meaning it hits the poor the hardest).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Jan. 3, the wholesale cost of natural <b>gas</b>
 in Alberta was $1.87 per gigajoule. At $1.51 per gigajoule, the 
lgunter@postmedia.com carbon tax is equal to an 81 per cent sales tax on
 the current price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, there is a rebate 
that will lessen the impact of the carbon tax for many Albertans. But 
imagine the wailing and shrieking from the NDP if they were in 
opposition and another party's government had put an 81 per cent sales 
tax on something as essential as the fuel we use to heat our homes in 
-30 weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The carbon tax doesn't 
increase the cost of Albertans'total natgas bills by 81 per cent. The 
average bill also has a bunch of other fees - distribution charges, 
monthly fixed charges, reserve charges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet even with all these add-ons, the Notley government's carbon tax still amounts to one-quarter of our total bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then consider the effect of the carbon tax on gasoline. It's now nearly seven cents a litre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We and other media 
outlets have this week carried stories reassuring the public that 
"Albertans continue to pay less at the pump than most Canadians."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what? The point is, our gasoline prices are no longer the lowest. There is no clear Alberta Advantage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time I can 
remember, while travelling in Saskatchewan over the holidays, the price 
of gasoline was lower there than here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to gasbuddy. com and the CAA, we're paying more here than in Manitoba.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The oil and natural <b>gas</b> come from here. Yet we no longer have a price advantage thanks to NDP taxes and regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, as the NDP shut 
down our coal-fired power plants and replace them with 
heavily-subsidized wind farms, we are seeing electricity prices and 
taxpayer payouts to utility companies rise, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the same with income
 taxes. Ours are no longer clearly the lowest in the country. They are 
higher than B.C. and Ontario's, and only slightly lower than 
Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP's most recent 
emissions standards and fees have eliminated our competitive advantage 
there, as well, just as their increases to our minimum wage are 
estimated to harm job growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And what have we got to 
show for all these increases; for the elimination of our advantage? Are 
there any pipelines being built with all the "<b>social licence</b>" 
we're buying? Is the Notley government using the new revenues generated 
by its taxes to balance the budget or are they still running up record 
deficits and soaring debt? On New Year's Eve, the Notley government sent
 out a news release insisting their carbon tax was helping to diversify 
the Alberta economy. But the economies being diversified by NDP policies
 are those in Saskatchewan, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas and elsewhere.
 That's where the investment dollars being scared away by the NDP are 
going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And to top all of this 
off, there is almost no chance the loss of the Alberta Advantage will 
have much impact on the global environment.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta government is hoping the tide will finally turn in 2018 when it comes to getting a pipeline to tidewater built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP government saw a clear path forward for the expansion of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s Trans Mountain pipeline to the British Columbia coast when the Trudeau cabinet approved the project in late 2016.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But
 there has been continued environmental, Indigenous and municipal 
opposition to the pipeline on the west coast, with the situation further
 complicated when B.C.'s new NDP government took office in July, 
pledging to use whatever tools were in its toolbox to stop the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the new year turns, 
however, Premier Rachel Notley sees progress in the fight for the 
$7.4-billion Trans Mountain project, which is viewed as crucial in 
opening the Asian market to and gaining better prices for Alberta's 
oilsands crude.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm cautiously 
optimistic we will see shovels in the ground in 2018, yes," she said in a
 year-end interview with Postmedia at McDougall Centre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley's approach as the pipeline battle heated up in 2017 was two-fold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, the province 
engaged legally where it could, seeking and gaining intervener status in
 the Federal Court case that sees a group of First Nations, 
municipalities and environmental groups seeking to overturn federal 
approval of Trans Mountain, as well as in the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span> hearings where <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> took on Burnaby over delayed permits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latter case, the <span class="companylink">NEB</span> ruled that <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> could proceed with construction of terminals in Burnaby without complying with two sections of municipal bylaws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second part of 
Notley's strategy involved sharpening her own pro-pipeline pitch in a 
series of speeches in Toronto, Ottawa and Vancouver. Among the key 
messages were that pipelines are economically beneficial to all of 
Canada and that Alberta's commitment to sweeping action on climate 
change would falter if pipelines are blocked by the rest of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley said the 
government will keep up those efforts in 2018, with the decision in 
Federal Court potentially a major turning point for the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's the whole effort to bring public opinion along with us on this and that will continue," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Obviously, as the legal 
challenges unfold, the positioning of everybody will change and the 
scope of opportunity for the opposition will hopefully change and 
narrow."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The premier said that in 
the new year, Alberta will also continue to prod the federal Liberal 
government to promote and defend the pipelines it has approved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the politics of 
pipelines are increasingly complicated for the Notley government, 
especially with the demise of the Energy East pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed pipeline to New Brunswick was shelved this year by <span class="companylink">TransCanada Corp</span>., with the <span class="companylink">NEB</span>'s decision to consider downstream greenhouse <b>gas</b> emissions a factor in its demise.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In
 a perverse kind of way, this week's 50 per cent increase in Alberta's 
unpopular carbon tax - to $30 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions - 
could be a big gift from Rachel Notley's NDP government to her opponent,
 United Conservative Party (UCP) opposition leader Jason Kenney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase means the province now ties British Columbia for having the highest carbon tax in the country.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in Alberta it stings as the province uses more energy for heating and transportation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost in a typical 
Alberta household of a $30 a tonne tax is $667 a year, compared to $362 
in the typical B.C. household, according to a study by Jennifer Winter, 
an energy economist at the University of Calgary's school of public 
policy. At $50 a tonne, the annual cost is $1,111 in Alberta and $603 in
 B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's no small change in a
 lousy provincial economy with high unemployment. Polls consistently 
show strong disapproval of the tax, which piles on top of higher taxes 
and increased environmental regulations that are depressing job creation
 in the oil and <b>gas</b> sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's hefty carbon 
tax is one of the big pieces of the province's climate leadership plan, 
pushed through by Notley's government when Alberta's conservatives were 
in disarray and political implications seemed remote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question is whether 
Albertans embrace the tough medicine and its benefits, as claimed by the
 government, or will slam the door on the tax grab when they return to 
the polls next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's what the UCP, 
which reunited conservatives last year and picked Kenney to lead them, 
is counting on. Meanwhile, the duelling views are clashing hard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">University of Calgary 
economics professor Trevor Tombe said the carbon tax is controversial 
because it's visible in heating bills and at the pumps and because of 
its negative economic impact. Even government estimates show it shrinks 
GDP and deters employment, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the plan, the tax 
increases to $50 a tonne by 2022 to line up with federal goals. But 
other provinces are taking longer to ramp up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carbon is priced at $19 a
 tonne in the cap-and-trade market in Quebec and Ontario. Provinces 
without carbon pricing are subject to the federal carbon price, which 
starts at $10 per tonne in 2018 and rises by $10 per year to $50 per 
tonne in 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta NDP says the benefits of its carbon tax include economic diversification away from oil and <b>gas</b>, job creation from greener jobs, emissions reductions, and tax rebates for those with lower incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, green-job creation hasn't offset the estimated 100,000 oil and <b>gas</b> jobs lost over the last three years, partly due to Alberta's climate change plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cheryl Oates, 
communications director for Notley, said 2,000 jobs have been created 
from energy efficiency programs so far and another 1,300 jobs are 
expected. The recently announced winning bidders of renewable 
electricity projects are expected to create another 740 jobs, with 7,000
 jobs overall expected in new renewable energy by 2030.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province estimates it
 will collect $1.038 billion in revenue from the tax in fiscal 
2017-2018, rising to $1.396 billion in 2018-2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All revenue from carbon 
pricing is reinvested back into Alberta's economy to reduce emissions, 
support renewable energy and help Alberta families and businesses adjust
 to the price of carbon," said Oates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government also 
argues that even with the increase in carbon pricing, Alberta has an 
overall tax advantage compared to other provinces because it has no 
provincial sales tax, health premium or payroll tax. It estimates 
Albertans and Alberta businesses will still pay at least $8.7 billion 
less in total taxes and carbon charges than if the province had the same
 tax system and carbon pricing as other provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney says he would 
immediately repeal the "job killing tax" if elected premier - and at the
 same time put a big dent in the federal government's own climate change
 plan, which relies on Alberta toeing the line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Alberta families and 
job-creators have suffered enough under this NDP government, and now 
they have to endure a 50-per-cent increase in a carbon tax that hasn't 
converted a single opponent of Alberta's energy industry into a 
supporter," Kenney said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The carbon tax was supposed to buy '<b>social licence</b>'for
 pipelines to get built. Instead, since the NDP announced its plan, 
Justin Trudeau vetoed approved Northern Gateway, Barack Obama vetoed 
Keystone XL, the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span> 
effectively killed Energy East, and the NDP government in B.C. is doing 
everything it can to block Trans Mountain. Not one single government, 
party, or special interest group has gone from 'no'to 'yes'on pipelines 
as a result of the NDP's failed tax on everything."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the trend continues, 
and the two remaining pipeline projects aren't built, Notley would hand 
her political opponents another big gift by showing the tax is all pain 
and no gain. At this time, the odds are hard to call because the future 
of both Keystone XL and the Trans Mountain expansion depend on the 
resolution of legal disputes with opponents.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP government saw a clear path forward for the expansion of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s Trans Mountain pipeline to the British Columbia coast when the Trudeau cabinet approved the project in late 2016.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But
 there has been continued environmental, Indigenous and municipal 
opposition to the pipeline on the West Coast, with the situation further
 complicated when B.C.'s new NDP government took office in July, 
pledging to use whatever tools were in its tool box to stop the 
pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the new year turns, 
however, Premier Rachel Notley sees progress in the fight for the 
$7.4-billion Trans Mountain project, which is viewed as crucial in 
opening the Asian market to and gaining better prices for Alberta's 
oilsands crude.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm cautiously 
optimistic we will see shovels in the ground in 2018, yes," she said in a
 year-end interview with Postmedia in Calgary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley's approach as the pipeline battle heated up in 2017 was two-fold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, the province 
engaged legally where it could, seeking and gaining intervener status in
 the Federal Court case that sees a group of First Nations, 
municipalities and environmental groups seeking to overturn federal 
approval of Trans Mountain, as well as in the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span> hearings where <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> took on Burnaby over delayed permits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latter case, the <span class="companylink">NEB</span> ruled <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> could proceed with construction of terminals in Burnaby without complying with two sections of municipal bylaws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second part of 
Notley's strategy involved sharpening her own pro-pipeline pitch in a 
series of speeches in Toronto, Ottawa and Vancouver. Among the key 
messages were that pipelines are economically beneficial to all of 
Canada and that Alberta's commitment to sweeping action on climate 
change would falter if pipelines are blocked by the rest of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley said the 
government will keep up those efforts in 2018, with the decision in 
Federal Court potentially a major turning point for the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's the whole effort
 to bring public opinion along with us on this and that will continue," 
she said. "Obviously, as the legal challenges unfold, the positioning of
 everybody will change and the scope of opportunity for the opposition 
will hopefully change and narrow."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The premier said that in 
the new year, Alberta will also continue to prod the federal Liberal 
government to promote and defend the pipelines it has approved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the politics of

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His productivity has gone up 100%, while yours has merely risen by 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Alberta Premier 
Rachel Notley claims the provincial economy is turning around (as she 
did this week), she's kind of being like Lumpy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The improvement Notley and other New Democrats are referring to are relative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's true the Alberta 
economy is finally expanding again, but on many key indicators we 
haven't even returned to the levels we were at when the NDP took over in
 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We may have taken a step 
ahead, but that's after having taken multiple steps backwards - carbon 
taxes, income taxes, staggering deficits, growing debt, lost investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you think of the 
province's economy as a hole we've been digging deeper and deeper the 
last three years, it's fair to say most of the downward progress has 
stopped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But despite the good news Lumpy ... er, Notley referred to, we are still unable to peer out over the edge of our hole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unemployment rate is 
7.3%. That's a lot better than the 9% it hit a little more than a year 
ago. Yet it is far away from the 5.8% it was at when the NDP came to 
office in May 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unemployment rate 
also doesn't take into account the number of Albertans who have given up
 looking for work entirely (about 25,000) and the number who lost 
good-paying oil industry jobs and are now working for far less money 
(about 170,000).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investment in oil and <b>gas</b>
 and in construction is beginning to rebound, but here our economy is 
especially slow. While investment was $97 billion in 2014 and $76 
billion in 2015 (just before the NDs took over), it was an anemic $62 
billion in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is estimated that over
 $35 billion in energy investment has been lost due, in whole or in 
part, to NDP policies such as the carbon tax and the stringent emission 
controls announced earlier this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether or not the economy is improving, and whether or not NDP environmental policy buys us "<b>social licence</b>" to get pipelines built, we will have to attract a LOT of new investment to make up for the investment the NDP have scared off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of 
conventional oil wells drilled in September this year (435) was up 75% 
from September last year. Bravo. That is still less than half of the 
five-year high of 896.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At $992 million (almost 
$1 billion), the number of building permits issued in the province from 
October 2016 to October 2017 sounds impressive, until you realize that's
 a one-year drop of 51.2% from over $2 billion in October 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business incorporations remain sluggish: There was 3,400 when the New Dems took office, compared to just 3,200 a month, now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exports are up, wholesale trade is up and so is manufacturing. The <span class="companylink">Canadian Federation of Independent Business</span>
 even reported Thursday that small-business confidence is a solid 60.1 
out of 100, a far cry from the bottom level of 26.5 in early 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, confidence levels are higher in Quebec, B.C. and even Nova Scotia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After nearly three years of recession, we'll take any positive news we can get.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it might be a little early yet for Lumpy to go boasting about that job on the sandwich assembly line.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airlines serving Eastern 
Canada's three biggest airports are pushing ahead with a major jetfuel 
transport project in Montreal in a bid to better secure supply amid 
growing demand for air travel.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But
 the $150-million plan faces opposition from citizen groups, who say it 
brings little economic value to Montreal East and merely adds to the 
onisland suburb's unfortunate reputation as Quebec's “dumpster."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The clash will once again test the province's appetite for oil and <b>gas</b> infrastructure development after <span class="companylink">TransCanada Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">abandoned its Energy East
 pipeline project in October. It pits residents of one of Canada's most 
industrialized districts against airlines enjoying robust passenger 
traffic and record profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is always a risk that hurdles, such as a <b>social-licence</b>
 requirement, end up killing very good projects," said Youri Chassin, an
 independent economist and former research director for the Montreal 
Economic Institute think tank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Montreal International 
Fuel Facilities Corp., a consortium of more than 30 airlines that own 
the jet-fuel storage and distribution infrastructure at Montreal Trudeau
 International Airport, is leading the project, which will also serve 
Toronto's Pearson International and Ottawa's Macdonald-Cartier hubs. The
 aim is to improve the security and reliability of aviation jetfuel 
supply to the three airports by building a new marine fuelsupply 
terminal along the St.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Seaway in Montreal East.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The terminal, on Crown land managed by the <span class="companylink">Montreal Port Authority</span>,
 would include equipment to unload fuel from ships and eight storage 
tanks. Another facility linked to the terminal would also be built at a 
separate site nearby to load the fuel onto train cars and tanker trucks.
 Finally, a roughly sevenkilometre-long pipeline measuring 30 
centimetres in diameter would be built, connecting the terminal to 
Trans-Northern Pipelines Inc.'s Ontario-Quebec pipeline to serve the 
Trudeau airport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, airline demand
 for aviation fuel at the three airports exceeds by 50 per cent the 
volumes produced by local oil refineries, said project spokesman Robert 
Iasenza, president of FSM Group, the firm managing the project. That 
means airlines are having to import jet fuel to cover their needs, he 
said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That importation is 
currently done through the Port of Quebec City, where fuel is unloaded 
from ships onto trains destined for Pearson and trucks destined for 
Trudeau and MacdonaldCartier. A new Montreal terminal would cut the land
 transportation distance to the airfields by some 200 km and provide a 
second place to unload in addition to Quebec City, Mr. Iasenza said. It 
would also likely reduce the cost of fuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The supply chain today 
is vulnerable," Mr. Iasenza said, adding there have been several near 
shortages at the three airports in recent years. “There are over 1,000 
flights a day leaving those airports. If there's no fuel, there's no 
flight."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vincent Marchione, 
president of a citizens environmental vigilance group in Montreal East, 
is among those who oppose the project. His chief concerns include the 
state of the local Trans-Northern line, which has experienced several 
spills in recent years and is under a special monitoring security order 
by the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>. He also says the planned storage tanks are too close, at 350 metres, to nearby homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Montreal East has 
historically been a heavily industrialized area, hosting major oil 
refining and storage installations and chemical plants. “It has become a
 dumpster," Mr. Marchione said, adding that the industrial vocation has 
to change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marie Durand, a member of
 the Alerte Pétrole Rive-Sud citizens group, also opposes the plan. She 
says it's “immoral," attributing her position on the issue a question of
 “climate justice."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“[The promoters] say this project will lower greenhouse <b>gas</b>
 emissions because there will be more transport by ship," Ms. Durand 
said. “That's true, but it's a partial truth." The flip side is that the
 plan was conceived to respond to an increase in flights, she said, and 
that means more pollution, not less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The airlines consortium 
has asked Quebec's environmental assessment agency to examine the impact
 of the project, which was delayed after its initial introduction in 
2015 over questions about soil remediation. A public information and 
consultation period is under way and scheduled to run until Jan.12. The 
consortium hopes to start construction in the spring of 2019.</p>

Cabinet's decision sailed straight into a potential legal challenge from
 the West Moberly and Prophet River First Nations, that declared their 
intent to launch civil litigation against Site C arguing it infringes 
their treaty rights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was John Horgan's NDP
 that demanded a Site C inquiry," said Roland Wilson, Chief of the West 
Moberly First Nation in a statement, and he believes "the only 
responsible choice was to immediately stop destroying the Peace River 
Valley," based on its findings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The environmental group 
Sierra Club of B.C. said it will back First Nations in their challenge, 
calling Horgan's decision a betrayal of his government's promise to 
enact the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Human-rights issues need to be considered in commitments to the Paris Climate Accord, said Galen Armstrong, a <span class="companylink">Sierra Club</span>
 campaign organizer in the Peace River Valley, and "this is a human 
rights issue when you have 100 kilometres of Treaty 8 (First Nations) 
land and First Nations demanding it not be flooded."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commission's report made no recommendations to government about its decision, but its report did question <span class="companylink">B.C. Hydro</span>'s
 demand forecasts and stated alternative power sources such wind, solar 
and geothermal generation could deliver similar benefits to Site C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Site C's supporters, however, believe the decision will deliver more long-term benefits in green-house-<b>gas</b>-free energy despite the project's start in political controversy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It sort of sounds like 
(government) was check-mated into it a little bit," said Val Litwin, CEO
 of the B.C. Chamber of Commerce, referring the extent to which Horgan's
 government inherited the thorny issue from former premier Christy 
Clark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Litwin said that
 "from the business community's perspective, this is a huge win," in 
terms of being an infrastructure investment that will, despite 
short-term pain, deliver long-term gains in less costly electricity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is not a 10-year 
energy project, this isn't even a 50-year energy project," Litwin said. 
"This is a 100-year energy project," and argued that its cost-benefit 
equation should be extrapolated over a longer period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I can't think of a major infrastructure project where we looked back and said 'we never should have done that,'" Litwin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in the short term, 
for "the over 2,000 men and women working on that project, it is a great
 Christmas gift knowing they will have jobs in 2018," said Chris 
Gardner, president of the Independent Contractors and Business 
Association of B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the $10.7 billion
 cost, Gardner argued that Site C represents "a tremendous opportunity 
for British Columbia to help facilitate" Canada's transition away from 
fossil fuels and "make our economy more competitive."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, supporters acknowledge that Horgan's government needs to do more to try to bridge the divisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All of the issues that 
came out (in the utilities commission review) and all the positions were
 really valid," said Wayne Peppard, representative for the Allied Hydro 
Council. "It's just unfortunate we were forced into the position to have
 that kind of divisive debate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peppard argued that revising <span class="companylink">B.C. Hydro</span>'s
 procurement procedures to include a project-labour agreement with the 
council, would be one way of better distributing the benefits of the 
project to gain support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government will also have to "develop a much larger <b>social licence</b>"
 in its so-called turnaround, said Tom Sigurdson, executive director of 
the B.C. Building Trades Council, but he supports the decision as an 
opportunity to develop skilled tradespeople as baby boomers retire.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This
 week Alberta's NDP government announced it was changing the way the 
province's largest industries are charged for their carbon emissions. 
They claim the changes will achieve both emission reductions and provoke
 a lot of new economic activity and jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have our doubts about both claims.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 details are complicated and the government hasn't been very good at 
explaining just how their new regulations will achieve the gold-plated 
goals they predict without further burdening our energy sector with high
 compliance costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environment Minister 
Shannon Phillips seemed to imply that by waving the risk of much higher 
environmental charges in businesses faces, the new regs would spark "a 
race to the top." Rather than pay higher fees to government, companies 
will get competitive about adopting the latest technologies to reduce 
greenhouse gases given off by oil exploration, petrochemical 
manufacturing or fertilizer production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good plan. But where are 
companies struggling with the third year of an economic downturn 
supposed to get the extra money to invest in expensive "green" 
technology? Ah, the NDP have an answer for that, too: Government 
subsidies! The NDP admit the new regulations will be expensive for 
companies, but they also insist they will be "recycling a significant 
amount of the anticipated revenues back into our industries." So the net
 effect on corporate cashflows will be negligible (if you believe the 
government's promises).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the only things that 
are certain are that the new regulations will cost more - perhaps much 
more - and the subsidies to help pay for technological innovation are 
not guaranteed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no assurance that
 companies with the greatest emissions will be the recipients of the 
greatest subsidies, even if they invest in a lot of "green" 
improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The UCP opposition claim 
the NDP's new regs will cost up to an extra $1.2 billion a year within 
just three years. The government counters those "are the total 
compliance costs, not cash costs to industry ... some of these costs 
will be additional, but not all."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless of what the 
new costs will be, they will be higher than they are now and way higher 
than they were when the NDP took over. In 2015, the charge on 
large-scale emitters brought in $160 million each year, by 2020 that 
will rise to $1.2 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a worldwide oil 
market, where even a few cents per barrel in increased costs can prompt a
 company to pull up stakes in one jurisdiction and move its operations 
to another, an increase of the size Alberta energy companies have 
suffered under the Notley government will almost certainly compel 
companies to leave our province - and take valuable jobs with them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even last year, a <span class="companylink">Fraser Institute</span> survey of oil and <b>gas</b>
 analysts found Alberta under the NDP had slipped from 14th-best place 
to 43rd-best (out of 96 energy jurisdictions). After this latest 
regulator piling-on, we will certainly slip further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP are convinced their new regulations for large emitters will buy us "<b>social licence</b>" to get pipelines built, But they said the same about their carbon tax, and look at how that's turned out.</p>

 things are apparent coming out of the provincial government's big 
announcement Wednesday about changes to overhaul its carbon tax on big 
industrial operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. 1: The shift should lead to less greenhouse <b>gas</b> emissions from these large players. No. 2: There will be a cost to industry.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environment
 Minister Shannon Phillips was quick to make the first point while 
talking to reporters in Calgary, but a little more reluctant to 
acknowledge the second.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The costs - the 
compliance obligations on the one hand - (by) industry are offset by the
 benefits," she said, when asked about its potential effect on industry 
competitiveness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We expect on balance 
there is going to be a positive economic effect from this," Phillips 
added, citing new pipeline approvals as a big win coming from the 
government's climate plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without getting into the murky merits of <b>social licence</b>,
 Wednesday's move is the product of almost two years of complex policy 
development intended to revamp Alberta's carbon levy on large industrial
 facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta is the largest 
generator of greenhouse gases in the country and this fact is tied to 
the very structure of Alberta's energy-powered economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, oilsands operations alone account for about one-quarter of all provincial emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of measuring 
emissions and GHG reductions on a facility-by-facility basis, as the old
 provincial program did, the new system will benchmark each major 
industry - such as cement, fertilizer and oilsands - on their emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under this "output-based 
allocation system" - a name only a policy wonk could love - the province
 will impose its revamped carbon tax on these larger emitters, beginning
 Jan. 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short, the most 
efficient firms with the lowest emissions within their sector will 
receive credits; less-efficient producers will end up paying more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This should lead to a "race to the top," Phillips said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea is to give heavy polluters an incentive to invest and make improvements to reduce their GHG levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government estimates 
the new regulations will lower emissions in Alberta by 50 million tonnes
 by 2030. That's the equivalent of taking 11.5 million vehicles off the 
road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But let's be clear: it won't be free.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2016-17, the existing carbon levy on industrial facilities raised $160 million in revenues for the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the new plan, that figure is expected to grow to about $600 million in 2018-19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The total compliance costs for all sectors will increase steadily over three years as the new carbon tax regime is phased in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such costs will reach $1.2 billion by 2020-21, according to Environment Department officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This doesn't mean 
industry will be cutting an equivalent cheque to government, as there 
are other ways to lower carbon costs, such as buying cheaper offsets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government officials expect program revenues will be in the neighbourhood of $800 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It should be noted the 
province is also offering money through grants and other programs to 
trigger investments in innovations to curb emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other mitigation measures are being introduced to soften the blow on companies hit hard by the changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what will it mean for
 Alberta's large industries and big employers? The United Conservative 
Party predicted the new system will lead to job losses and a drop in 
investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They point to an internal
 government analysis from earlier this year that predicted between six 
and 15 oilsands projects may be at risk of seeing a significant drop in 
their sales or profits due to the shift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers</span> said it needs to see all the gritty details to understand how it will affect the oilpatch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think it looks like 
about a five-times increase over the current costs and that is 
substantial to our industry," said CAPP president Tim McMillan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Any time that we see increased costs on our production, it means somewhere else is more attractive."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the 
province, the average carbon cost for oilsands miners would be 
relatively modest, reaching 18 cents a barrel by 2020. For thermal 
oilsands producers, the number would hit 50 cents a barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the announcement, <span class="companylink">Imperial Oil</span>
 issued a statement saying "there is no question that any increased cost
 on industry impacts our competitiveness, particularly in the current 
challenging overall business environment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources</span> also said 
the new system will affect the industry's competitiveness and stressed 
it doesn't adequately recognize investments the company made in thermal 
oilsands projects that use cyclic steam stimulation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's little doubt the 
new structure is a vast improvement from the existing levy put in place a
 decade ago. Economist Trevor Tombe at the <span class="companylink">University of Calgary</span>
 said the old program "really penalized" more efficient operators. The 
new system will provide a strong incentive within the sector to shift 
investment and production toward more efficient firms and resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, he agrees there is room for a debate on the competitiveness front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Every policy change has 
winners and losers - there are beneficiaries and there are those who end
 up paying higher cost," Tombe said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The changes today 
benefit some facilities and, yeah, lead to higher costs on others. But 
for the sector as a whole, roughly the same amount of carbon revenue is 
going to be recycled."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a complicated process and the industry will be hunting for more details in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will drive emissions 
lower in Alberta, which is a worthy goal. But let's not pretend it won't
 come with a cost for some players. Chris Varcoe is a Calgary Herald

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remember
 during the leaders'debate in the 2015 provincial election when then 
Tory premier Jim Prentice got in trouble for chastising NDP Leader 
Rachel Notley's tax calculations by saying "I know that math is 
difficult ..." His remark might have been condescending, but it was 
correct.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever since being elected, our NDP government has had real trouble with math, particularly this week.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP are not alone, of course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the UCP-friendly group Alberta Can't Wait (ACW) was all thumbs on its calculators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On social media, ACW insisted "you're heating bill is about to increase by 75%" when the NDP raise their carbon tax on Jan. 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's wrong. And coverage of the error obscured the truth about the tax, which is more than bad enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The truth is, once the 
NDP raise their carbon tax from $1.01 to $1.52 per gigajoule, the tax 
will be equivalent to 75% of the current price Albertans are paying for <b>gas</b> to heat their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On natural <b>gas</b>, Rachel Notley's carbon tax will be the equivalent of a 75% GST.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the carbon tax is
 a fixed rate that does not fall when the price of natgas falls, if the 
increase had been in place in September when <b>gas</b> was selling for $1.20, the tax would have been worth more than the <b>gas</b> on which it was being levied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would have been equivalent to a sales tax of 127%. Outrageous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result of the carbon tax increase on Jan. 1, the overall cost of natural <b>gas</b>
 Albertans pay will rise about 16 % (from $3 to $3.50 a gigajoule), 
which is bad enough. But the cost will not jump 75%, as ACW had claimed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, imagine what the 
NDP would be saying if a UCP government were implementing a regressive 
tax of 75% on any good or service. The shrieks about government preying 
on the poor and least-able-to-pay would be heard as far away as the 
Rockies and Lloydminster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ACW's error shouldn't
 detract from two clangers made this week by the NDP; one by Premier 
Notley herself and the other by Finance Minister Joe Ceci.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a call-in show on CBC 
Calgary on Tuesday, Notley was told by a listener named Norm that his 
business was paying $40,000 a year in carbon taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The premier dismissed his claim and even seemed to doubt whether he was paying any carbon tax at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If he was, however, Notley implied he should be happy to pay because he was helping buy the province "<b>social licence</b>" to get pipelines built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later in the day, when 
the UCP took up Norm's cause in the legislature, the NDP fired back that
 large-scale emitters are exempted from paying the carbon "levy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's not hard to 
believe that the owner of a mid-sized oil service company - who is not 
exempt - would pay $40,000 annually in carbon tax to run his company's 
trucks, heat its buildings and fuel its heavy equipment and generators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of which makes me 
wonder if the NDP have any real understanding of ordinary Albertans and 
how NDP environmental policy impacts them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other math-is-difficult moment for the Notley government came during a scrum at the legislature with Minister Ceci.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked by reporters 
whether the government's lack of spending control, and the bond-rating 
downgrades that have followed, would lead to higher borrowing costs 
(which they will), Ceci's headshaking reply was "this will all come out 
in the wash and be a wash."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is reminiscent of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's uninformed claim that "the budget will balance itself."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Ceci is the finance minister.</p>

Rachel Notley isn't going to let the fact that she has yet to get any 
pipelines built stop her from giving lessons on how to get pipelines 
built. In a speech to Ottawa's Economic Club last week, she lectured 
oil-industry champions and "conservatives" that "denying (manmade) 
climate change ... won't get pipelines built." The Alberta premier's 
last lesson on getting pipelines built told Albertans they needed carbon
 taxes to win "<b>social licence</b>" from opponents. That hasn't worked
 either, which is why Notley had to travel to B.C. this week with the 
federal natural resources minister to plead with opponents there to 
please stop opposing the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyway,
 try and find a prominent conservative in Ottawa or Alberta who hasn't 
agreed to go along with the manmade-climate-change orthodoxy. Or an oil 
industry representative, for that matter, with the <span class="companylink">Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers</span>
 recently saying (as reported by Post columnist John Robson( 
http://nationalpost.com/opinion/john-robson-does-canada-oil-industry-really-agree-that-its-destroying-life-as-we-know-it[http://nationalpost.com/opinion/john-robson-does-canada-oil-industry-really-agree-that-its-destroying-life-as-we-know-it]
 ) from a recent Manning Centre conference) "If we spend time as an 
industry or as Western Canadians arguing about climate... we'll not get 
any more pipelines built." So conservatives, westerners and oil 
executives have tried the hell out of the 
not-denying-manmade-climate-change approach, and the pipeline enemies 
still win every time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The compelled political 
agreement on the dangers of fossil fuels is surely what is actually to 
blame for smothering any and all economically important energy 
mega-projects, from pipelines to LNG plants. But as those profitable 
opportunities are killed, stunting the tax base, governments keep 
promoting - and paying for - more and more unprofitable "green" 
technologies in the name of helping businesses shift to the post-carbon 
economy, thus doubling the loss. In fact, just days before Notley turned
 up in Ottawa, Elon Musk held a splashy, VIP-studded press conference in
 Hawthorne, Calif. to unveil the Tesla's new battery-powered cargo truck
 and new battery-powered superfast roadster - the latest, pointless, 
big-ticket items that Canadian taxpayers will be forced to subsidize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be clear, what Musk 
actually unveiled were mocked-up props, pretending to be prototypes and 
housing none of the actual technology Musk promised would work, 
eventually. The Tesla founder's gift for razzle-dazzle managed to get 
the audience to cheer, and journalists to go ga-ga, all for a cargo 
truck that might drive all of five hours on a single charge, as if it 
were the moonshot for history's least ambitious generation. "While 
you're unloading your cargo, you can charge (it)!" "Every truck we sell 
will have enhanced autopilot - standard!" And, of course: "Order now, 
get the truck in two years!"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Post Driving columnist
 David Booth has noted, Musk's claims about this yet-to-be-invented 
truck don't even add up. "At current prices, the batteries alone could 
cost as much as US$200,000," he calculated, compared to the US$120,000 
price for an entire diesel rig. Those batteries, meanwhile, could weigh 
more than the entire payload, require charging technology that also 
doesn't yet exist, and the closest charger we have to it now, at less 
than a third of the capacity, is "about the size of a small <b>gas</b> 
station kiosk and costs in the range of half a million bucks." Another 
battery expert told Bloomberg that Musk's roadster plan also relies on 
non-existent technology. But Tesla's current business model isn't about 
realism as much as using hype to suck up deposits from credulous fans, 
since bond markets have soured on company losses of US$8,000 a minute 
and its inability to keep to production schedules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, immediately 
following Tesla's imaginary-truck show, Loblaw followed with its own 
razzle-dazzle, announcing it was ordering 25 of them, and paying the 
US$5,000 deposit each (although Tesla, as it's known to do, quickly 
changed terms and began demanding US$20,000). Loblaw shareholders might 
worry about the wisdom of committing to an untested e-truck technology 
with no evidence of savings amid relentlessly rising electricity rates 
in the company's primary province of Ontario. But at least Loblaw has 
proven it knows how to shrewdly game subsidized green schemes for 
profit. The company was early to get in on Ontario's renewable energy 
handouts, putting solar panels on its roof and getting taxpayers to pay 
for it. And since Ontario is one of many jurisdictions that gives 
buyers' allowances for electric vehicles (another pillar of Tesla's 
business model) Loblaw's vow to switch its trucking fleet to 
all-electric green can only mean more taxpayer subsidies for that, too. 
The company might be laying off staff and closing stores in its 
traditional grocery retail division, but it's learned from Musk that 
there's money to be made in the booming new business of 
government-approved green-posturing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then again, maybe Loblaw 
is just another gullible Tesla buyer. Because, the grocer seems to be 
one of the very few companies bothering to tie up precious corporate 
resources worrying about whether or not the earth warms a degree or two 
over the next century. Despite constant talk in the news and from 
governments that Canadian businesses are lining up to join politicians 
in the climate-consensus club, all of them rapidly gearing up for 
post-carbon green mode, it turns out that isn't actually happening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, when the 
Institute of Corporate Directors issued its survey of Canadian 
boardrooms, the results showed that the nation's companies are focused 
almost entirely on more pressing matters, much to the disappointment of 
the institute itself. It said change was "not on the radar of enough 
boards" because only seven per cent had developed a strategy for it and 
only 24-per-cent more had considered it in their strategic planning, 
"indicating a difficulty for Directors in certain industries to make the
 connection between climate issues and their future impact on business, 
including on people movements and taxation." When asked to voluntarily 
identify "social issues discussed by the board," only 10 per cent of 
directors mentioned climate change. Presumably that group not only 
includes Loblaw, but also Alberta's climate-captive energy firms, for 
all the good it's doing them. Well, if they ever decide they could use 
some advice from somebody besides the NDP premier on how to succeed in 
actual, non-imaginary businesses, like building pipelines, they could 
always ask the other 90 per cent.</p>

 FOR THE THIRD QUARTER PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30TH, 2017</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">HTC Purenergy Inc</span>. has released its unaudited condensed consolidated financial results for the third quarter period ended Sept. 30, 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HTC, as a company, is 
engaged in environmental technologies through its HTC group of advanced 
environmental technology companies, namely HTC CO2 Systems Corp., Assist
 Energy Solutions Corp. and Clear Glycol &amp; Solvents Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During 2017, HTC has 
chosen to refocus its business units in the environmental technologies 
sector and has recently divested its industrial and agricultural 
divisions. The acceptance of climate change and the <b>social licence</b>
 that corporations are moving toward are upon the company in force. 
Carbon footprint and the capture and management of carbon dioxide has 
become effectively a currency of business, a vehicle for penalty and 
taxation, and a statement to shareholders, who expect environmental 
responsibility from the companies they invest in. The company notes, as 
well, that all segments of the energy sector must contribute, and as 
such, the management of CO2 from combustion-fired plants, can be used 
not only to reduce emissions, but also to improve oil production, 
through the use of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques. HTC has 
focused its efforts in this area over the past few years, as EOR 
provides an immediate economic benefit to an oil company, in addition to
 being able to meet its <b>social licence</b> responsibilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The natural <b>gas</b> industry has taken on a new challenge of <b>gas</b>
 cleanup of CO2, SO2 (sulphur dioxide) and other contaminants, while 
ensuring that the solvents and the glycols that are used in the cleanup 
process are recycled and reused, while at the same time providing a 
significant cost reduction to the customer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's delta 
purification division and the company's investment in ClearGSI are 
showing promising results, as the energy industry and many larger 
industrial companies have joined the re3 revolution: "reclaim, recycle, 
reuse."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tertiary oil 
production business requires a significant amount of water for 
production of steam and, at the same time, a significant capital cost to
 install traditional heavy oil production technologies. The Assist SCV 
technology allows the use of brackish production water, that normally 
would have to be disposed of or treated, to be used as steam for energy 
production. The SCV technology also allows the heavy oil producer to 
bring existing non-producing wells back on-line, with a minimal 
investment in capital costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Reclaim, recycle, reuse"
 is more than a tag line for the company: The company is a world leader,
 delivering technology in this solvent and glycol sector. Please read, 
in more detail below, the exciting environmental technologies the 
company is now making a reality.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTERRE CONSOLIDATES ANTLER ASSETS THROUGH ACQUISITION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questerre Energy Corp</span>. has closed an acquisition of producing Bakken/Torquay oil assets in the Antler area of southeastern Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, president and chief executive officer of Questerre, 
commented: "This accretive acquisition consolidates our operated working
 interest at Antler. We now own 100 per cent of these assets and add 
low-decline, high-netback light oil production to our base of 
conventional assets. Post this acquisition, current production from the 
area, including adjacent production from Pierson, Man., is approximately
 450 barrels per day."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company acquired 
approximately 180 bbl/d of light oil production in the Antler area for 
gross consideration of $7.25-million, subject to customary industry 
adjustments. Acquired assets include 3-D seismic data over the producing
 acreage with a value of approximately $770,000. The effective date of 
the acquisition is Oct. 1, 2017. The proved and probable reserves 
associated with these assets will be assessed by the company's 
independent reserve engineers in conjunction with the year-end 2017 
reserve evaluation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questerre also reported 
that it is submitting its comments on the draft hydrocarbon regulations 
to the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources in Quebec this week. The
 company anticipates that subject to the review of the comments received
 from stakeholders, the regulations should be finalized in early 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About <span class="companylink">Questerre Energy Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questerre Energy</span> is leveraging its 
expertise gained through early exposure to shale and other 
non-conventional reservoirs. The company has base production and 
reserves in the tight oil Bakken/Torquay of southeast Saskatchewan. It 
is bringing on production from its lands in the heart of the 
high-liquids Montney shale fairway. It is a leader on <b>social licence</b> to operate issues for its Utica shale <b>gas</b> discovery in the St. Lawrence Lowlands, Quebec.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Combatting climate change
 hinges on divestment of fossil fuels across all spheres of activity. 
According to scientists, we are facing an impending disaster if we do 
not stop burning fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Therefore, companies must
 reduce their carbon footprint to net zero, and carbon-based firms that 
cannot or refuse to change must wind down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Communities with 
significant economic dependence on firms that refuse to change must 
invest in and attract clean sustainable industries instead. Communities 
have to act now so as to save their local economies before some of these
 large firms shrink, withdraw or fail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian pension plans have an important role to play in this transition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a review of the top 
Canadian pension plans’ policies (see below), I have found that they 
don’t discuss divestment. What’s more, the information provided on their
 investments is inconsistent and not very transparent. As the pension 
plan becomes smaller, the information becomes sparser — to the point 
that that there is insufficient information available to draw any 
conclusions. The lack of transparency is a serious problem that needs to
 be rectified.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was able to surmise 
from a study of several years’ reports of Canada’s top five pension 
plans, all of them offering incomplete information, that the Ontario 
Teacher’s Pension Plan (OTPP) seems to be reducing its share of fossil 
fuel investments. But not with any stated intention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No apparent plans to divest</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other plans have not made significant moves to divest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prior research has 
overwhelmingly shown that ethical funds perform as well as traditional 
funds, yet pension funds in Canada are not ethical and are not 
divesting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These huge Canadian 
institutional investors have the discretion to make divestment decisions
 compared to pension plans in other countries that do not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, many of them
 are United Nations PRI (Principles for Responsible Investment) 
signatories. This initiative emphasizes what’s known as ESG — 
environmental, social and corporate governance. Its six core principles 
are focused on ethical, sustainable investing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big Canadian pension plans have signed onto these principles, yet they aren’t divesting of fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fossil fuel assets are 
becoming even more volatile as the world works towards the Paris climate
 targets. Pension plans in Canada primarily view these investments from a
 risk-management perspective, however, failing to employ an ethical 
lens. ESG considerations have become merely part of a risk management 
assessment and aren’t central to investment decisions. That flies in the
 face of their UN PRI promises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even when taking a risk-management perspective, divestment makes investing sense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pension funds not applying ethics</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After much investigation,
 I believe the problem is that the norms of investment as they relate to
 the concept of fiduciary duty are roadblocks to making this crucial 
investment policy change. Even though on an official basis, our pension 
plans have wide discretion, they seemingly don’t yet have the <b>social licence</b> to become ethical funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s because the 
concept of fiduciary duty — which calls for working in the best interest
 of pension members — needs to be revisited so that it’s in line with 
ethical investing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian pension plans 
apply an unenlightened perspective of fiduciary duty. They’ve translated
 fiduciary duty into meaning that pension funds must maximize returns 
without regard to what they’re investing in, or where.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investment funds 
place a few limits on the types of businesses they will invest in — like
 weapons, for example — but it’s a small list. The <span class="companylink">British Columbia Investment Management Corporation</span> and the <span class="companylink">Alberta Investment Management Corporation</span> screen out tobacco, munitions and land mines and nuclear investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec</span>
 also recently announced plans to begin divesting of coal and invest in 
clean industries. Hopefully the leadership of CEO Michael Sabia may 
signal the start of a trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working in the best 
interests of pension members, after all, includes not just today’s 
beneficiaries, but also the generations who are contributing now and 
will draw from the fund in the future, as well as those who will join as
 members in the more distant future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The businesses and 
industries chosen for pension fund investments matter to the economy of 
those future generations. It should be self-evident that pensions are 
inherently meant to provide future benefits over the long term. And so 
sustainability should be a key priority for pension plan managers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fiduciary duty is an 
ethical concept and ethics seem to demand that inter-generational equity
 should be a top consideration. What is actually in the best interests 
of all pension members is to divest of unsustainable assets that are 
likely going bust in the future anyway. Let’s take the profits and move 
on as any smart investor would do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s also not in the best interests of pension plan members to invest in foreign multi-national fossil fuel corporations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pension-plan members are 
Canadians whose jobs rely on healthy communities that would benefit from
 local entrepreneurship, technological development and diversification. 
It’s in their interests to invest in the sustainability of their own 
local economies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billions of pension dollars in fossil fuels</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our pension plans are 
very large in terms of assets under management, but the truth is that 
the fossil fuel industry is so big that whether pensions plans invest in
 it or divest has very little impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The greater impact of 
pension plan divestment, in fact, arises through the redirection of 
investment to local sustainable industries that would monumentally 
benefit from the capital infusion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the <span class="companylink">Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board</span> invests in a range of roughly $6.5 billion to $10.5 billion in oil and <b>gas</b>,
 depending on the year. Imagine if those funds were instead invested 
into the sustainable development of our economy, and the impact it would
 have on pensioners and future generations who live and work in those 
local economies. The health of Canada’s middle class is at stake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It bears repeating: 
Sustainable investments provide returns as good as any investments, and 
there are few reasons for Canada to invest in fossil fuels anymore, 
according to the <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> and other commentators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time to blaze a trail</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil-and-<b>gas</b> assets
 are unreliable commodities primarily controlled by international 
interests. Because the industry is not Canadian-controlled, it has no 
stake in working in the best interests of Canadian communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s time for sustainable
 investing to go mainstream. Canadian pension plans have the power to 
send the right message, given the urgency of climate change, by 
divesting of fossil fuels. They can blaze a trail for other 
institutional investor members of the UN PRI, thus setting precedents 
for funds in other nations where they are forced to respect strict 
investing guidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our pension plans can 
change outdated investing practices by showing what fiduciary duty truly
 means — sustainable, ethical investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Canadian pension 
plans divest and refocus on sustainable investing, our local economies 
will experience an increase in needed capital investment to grow and 
develop, setting an example for the world.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These short essays on 
energy, (starting today with a piece by Monica Gattinger, 
click&nbsp;here&nbsp;to access it) which also address climate and the 
environment, were commissioned by the Canadian Global Affairs Institute 
(CGAI), with support from <span class="companylink">Natural Resources Canada</span>,
 to help stimulate discussion in energy policy development. They 
complement the Trudeau government’s “Generation Energy” cross-country 
dialogue that culminated in a conference held in October 2017 in 
Winnipeg.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 topics were chosen following discussions with legislators and senior 
officials at the various levels of government, the private and public 
sector, and with the advice of the Advisory Council of the Canadian 
Global Affairs Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authors write from 
practical experience, all having either served or done work with 
governments and/or the private and research sectors. Our instruction to 
the authors was that the essays be short enough to be digested in a 
single sitting and that they offer policy advice based on the authors’ 
experience and analysis. The authors also participated in conversations 
that are all available in podcast form on CGAI’s Global Exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The general thread 
running through these essays is that Canada can and should be a global 
player in energy and climate development and that our knowledge and 
experience enable us to play a helpful role in global affairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, our influence 
and capacity have limits, many of which derive from how we manage and 
how we are seen to manage both our resources and climate at home. 
Domestic initiatives depend on <b>social licence</b>. This is something 
Canadian governments are coming to terms with, but coming to terms does 
not mean waiting forever. Consensus does not depend on unanimity. After 
deliberation and consultation, to govern is to choose.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have abundant hydro 
resources and we should be using renewable sources like wind, solar and 
tidal. However, in a cold climate, we need to maximize all our energy 
resources, including fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monica Gattinger writes 
about “Big Projects, Big Politics, Big Policy,” suggesting we need to 
strengthen public confidence in our energy decision-making if we are to 
avoid a “slow-motion train wreck.” Oilsands and pipelines may be today’s
 points of contention but so will be wind farms, fracking and big hydro 
projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Renewable or not,” 
writes Gattinger, “linear or non-linear, energy projects of all kinds 
and descriptions are running into opposition.” Failure to resolve 
Canada’s energy challenges costs the country in environmental 
performance, attracting investment and fostering economic growth and 
innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With lack of trust and 
policy gaps, Gattinger says public confidence in energy decision-making 
is low and declining. As a result, she says “decision-makers need to 
accept that social and value changes — and changes in the information 
and communications environment — are here to stay.” Regulators, for 
example, “need to develop more flexibility to engage with local and 
Indigenous communities and governments on big projects” and “decisions 
need to be taken in a timely fashion on big policy and on big energy 
projects.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dennis McConaghy has 
written a pair of papers. In “Can Canada Restore a Functional Regulatory
 Process for Major Infrastructure Projects?” McConaghy looks at recent 
pipeline experiences&nbsp; —Kinder Morgan, Northern Gateway, Energy 
East, Keystone XL — to argue that any political intervention should come
 early and only in respect to specific public interest issues. This will
 help avoid uncertainty for industry, including “the expenditure of 
hundreds of millions of dollars to comply with the expected regulatory 
rigour of a complete application.”&nbsp; McConaghy concludes “it remains
 in the country’s long-term interest to, at the very least, find as much
 efficiency in its regulatory processes as possible. If value judgments 
are to be imposed on resource development then that should be as up 
front as possible, and not waste capital and human resources.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How does Canada respond to stranded asset risk whether it be oil or <b>gas</b>?
 Amy Myers Jaffe says: “Canadian companies have stepped up the purchases
 of oilsands assets on the sale block from the international majors but 
it remains unclear whether reducing project size and deferring projects 
will be sufficient to allow these companies to keep the oilsands as an 
expanding production domain.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She says much will depend on global market oil prices as well as competition from other sources, including natural <b>gas</b>.
 “If protecting jobs and preventing more companies from exiting Alberta 
are more of a priority than revenues,” Jaffe writes, “Canadian provinces
 might need to reconsider how companies are taxed for riskier, higher 
cost oilsands projects. Diversification of government revenues to other 
sources of income as Canada shifts increasingly to non-resource related 
industries would be a prerequisite for this strategy.” Other policy 
levers to be considered include “increased public commitment to R &amp; D
 spending to find technologies and processes to lower the break-even 
costs of new and existing oilsands production projects and long-run 
programs to increase market creation for Canadian natural <b>gas</b>.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Cleland, in his 
“Canada and the Low Carbon Energy Revolution” says that meeting our 
Paris targets will require a “massive energy transformation” that under 
current conditions will mean “a huge shift in the role of electricity as
 a source of end-use energy, from where it stands today — approximately a
 fifth to a quarter (depending on province) of all end-use energy — to 
something closer to three-quarters by 2050.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cleland says while this 
may be desirable there will be costs, namely: “the stranding of Canadian
 resources and established infrastructure, the loss of Canada’s 
comparative advantage, higher end use energy costs to the economy and 
the diminution of the fuel diversity which has underpinned the security,
 reliability and resilience of our energy systems.” Cleland observes 
that “it will be hard. And for governments it will involve mostly 
political grief and only rarely, political joy.” We need “an open and 
realistic public debate on energy … a debate that confronts our 
physical, economic, social, institutional and political realities (and) 
that at the same time addresses our aspirations regarding greenhouse 
gases.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In “Thoughts on Canada’s 
Carbon Tax Agenda”, Kenneth Green writes that “in the new Trumpian 
environment … the U.S. is poised to boost its energy economy. Canada is 
poised to contract its own, through carbon pricing and climate action 
plans that are inimical to provincial and federal economies, and to 
people’s detriment in terms of higher prices for everything.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until we generate power 
and fuel mobility more cheaply than with carbon-intensive methods, and 
more reliably than current alternatives such as wind and solar power, 
Green contends we will see little progress on the kind of “massive 
decarbonization that Trudeau and other signatories to the Paris 
agreement pledged to achieve.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To avoid this calamity, 
Green recommends postponing the implementation of the various climate 
action plans and carbon taxes, until analysis can be done on their 
impact on Canadian competitiveness. In the meantime, says Green, 
Canadian policy-makers need to refocus their attention on making Canada 
resilient to climate change while ensuring that Canadians can adapt, 
whether climate change is man-made or natural.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dennis McConaghy’s second
 paper, “The Inescapability of Carbon Taxes for Canada”, points out that
 recent decisions — the Trump administration’s approval of the Keystone 
XL pipeline and the Trudeau government’s approval of the Kinder Morgan 
Trans Mountain and Enbridge Line 3 expansion projects — solve the market
 access crisis for Canadian hydrocarbons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McConaghy argues that 
“carbon pricing, reflecting the market, is the only viable answer” and 
he makes a series of suggestions as to its implementation, including 
uniform adoption as a federally imposed national tax with no mandates or
 cross-subsidies for clean technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To understand the shift 
in energy security, Petra Dolata says we need to look at both short-term
 geopolitics and partisan politicism, especially in democracies, and 
long-term energy development — the gradual shift away from fossil fuels —
 trajectories. She contends that besides “focusing on the supply side 
through championing renewables, demand-side measures, including energy 
efficiency targets, will become more important.” Her recommendations 
include: broad public discussion and debate on our energy future, and 
supporting natural <b>gas</b> as a transitional energy resource.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In “Energy as a Service: 
Going Beyond Energy Supply”, Normand Mousseau argues that Canada would 
greatly benefit from “focusing its transition largely on the consumption
 side.” Rethinking energy usage, writes Mousseau, forces us to question 
almost all our habits, structures and processes. It helps all aspects of
 society to find “more efficient approaches to building, heating, 
transporting and manufacturing.” The electricity sector, for example, 
needs to finish its transition to low-carbon production and find 
solutions for heavy transportation. A national vision, says Mousseau, 
requires a combined, collaborative effort adapted to each sector: 
building, transportation, urbanism, industry, agriculture, etc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In their paper, “More 
Hydro Power in Canada: Tapping Our Potential,” John Haffner and Jim 
Burpee argue that hydro power is the most significant power generation 
source in Canada’s electricity system and it needs to be harnessed to 
advantage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Haffner and Burpee point 
out the environmental and economic advantages that would accrue to 
Canada by doubling our hydro power capacity. To do so, they make four 
recommendations: add a reliability factor in evaluating costs of future 
generating options; push for a North American carbon price; include 
de-carbonization contribution as part of project assessments; and 
strengthen low carbon electricity co-operation across jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his original paper for
 this series Kelly Ogle argued the Energy East pipeline is necessary 
because “North American market diversity and access to tidewater are 
needed so Canada can safely and profitably realize on its enormous 
resource bounty.” And yet, despite the challenges in managing an 
asymmetric oil relationship with the U.S., and continued desire for 
export optionality, the project faced relentless opposition, constant 
regulatory hurdles, and economic and political uncertainty. In his new 
paper Ogle aims to examine the dynamic factors that ultimately led to 
the project’s failure, and affect this outcome may have on Canada’s oil 
industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our authors offer 
differing and sometimes contrasting policy options but they are united 
in recognition that our resource wealth is our national heritage. The 
rewards of this heritage should be applied to national purpose and to 
the national welfare. Development can be done in a sustainable fashion 
and this includes getting these resources to market, preferably through 
pipelines, still the most secure and safe method of transportation, as 
was demonstrated in repeated studies by U.S. authorities in their 
consideration of the Keystone XL permit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are innovative in the 
application of technology to reduce the impact of development on our 
land, water and air. We have been creative in the development of 
practical rules and regimes to govern use of these resources in a 
sustainable fashion, and we have also adapted. As Mike Cleland points 
out, “In the past century we’ve moved from wood to coal to oil and now 
multi-fuel sources.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once again, we are 
adapting our energy use and energy sources but we need to do so to 
Canada’s advantage. We hope that these papers contribute to the 
generation of more ideas and better policy options.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Michael Binnion reports</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTERRE RELEASES THIRD QUARTER 2017 RESULTS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questerre Energy Corp</span>. has released its financial and operating results for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, president and chief executive officer of Questerre, 
commented: "We are seeing the early results of our increased capital 
investment in Kakwa this year. Production from this area has almost 
doubled since the first quarter to 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent per 
day with four (0.92 net) wells brought on stream. Three (0.67 net) more 
wells will be completed in the fourth quarter. If we drill a similar 
number of wells next year, we could see another major increase in 
production by next December."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Highlights:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Kakwa joint venture development continues with additional drilling and completions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- The government of Quebec releases draft oil and <b>gas</b> regulation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Red Leaf begins a feasibility study for Jordan oil shale project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- A private placement for gross proceeds of $31-million was fully subscribed and closed early in fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Average daily 
production was 1,643 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter, 
and adjusted funds flow from operations was $1.94-million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commenting on Quebec, he 
noted: "The draft regulations released this quarter are another 
milestone towards developing our Utica shale discovery in Quebec. We 
expect to see the final regulations early next year after taking into 
account public comments. The regulations are workable but, in our 
opinion, can be improved to be more efficient and competitive. Recent 
government comments on the need for social acceptability are consistent 
with past comments from this government and industry. <b>Social licence</b> is a somewhat nebulous concept but has more and more become a requirement in western liberal democracies."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Updating developments on 
its oil shale assets, he further added: "The last tranche of our 
investment in Red Leaf closed during the quarter. The move to reusable 
capsules for their EcoShale process could be key to commercializing our 
multibillion-barrel oil shale resource in Jordan. This re-engineering 
has substantially reduced the estimated break-even price for their 
project to a range where Red Leaf believes it is economic at current 
prices. We are studying if it could do the same for our Jordan project."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result of the 
increased capital investment in Kakwa this year, the company reported 
higher production volumes over the prior quarter and prior year. 
Production averaged 1,643 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the 
quarter (2016: 1,275 boe per day) and 1,270 boe per day for the year to 
date (2016: 1,412 boe per day) with Kakwa accounting for almost 85 per 
cent of production this quarter (2016: 75 per cent). Gross revenue 
increased by one-third to $5.45-million with higher production volumes 
benefiting from marginally higher pricing in the period. The higher 
revenue contributed to adjusted funds flow from operations of 
$1.94-million for the period (2016: $1.45-million). The company reported
 a net loss of $2.64-million for the current quarter (2016: 
$1.07-million) and $6.79-million for the three quarters ended Sept. 30, 
2017 (2016: $3.51-million).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Net of a disposition of 
$4.45-million for shallow exploration rights at Kakwa, capital 
investment for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2017, was $12.77-million 
(2016: $8.96-million). Consistent with prior periods, the majority of 
this investment was made in Kakwa to drill and complete wells and expand
 infrastructure. The company also invested $10.33-million to increase 
its equity interest in Red Leaf. The company anticipates incremental 
investment at Kakwa in 2017 could be up to $7-million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The term adjusted funds flow from operations is a non-international financial reporting standard measure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questerre Energy</span> is leveraging its 
expertise gained through early exposure to shale and other 
non-conventional reservoirs. The company has base production and 
reserves in the tight oil Bakken/Torquay of southeast Saskatchewan. It 
is bringing on production from its lands in the heart of the 
high-liquids Montney shale fairway. It is a leader on <b>social licence</b> to operate issues for its Utica shale <b>gas</b> discovery in the St. Lawrence Lowlands, Quebec.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five
 years ago, as debate swelled across southern and central British 
Columbia about pipeline proposals to transport Alberta's oil sands crude
 to B.C. ports, members of the coastal Lax Kw'Alaams First Nation had an
 idea: develop an "energy corridor" across First Nations' traditional 
lands from Fort McMurray to the B.C. coast. Instead of endless arguments
 this corridor would provide a "<b>social licence</b>," not only for oil pipelines but potentially for liquefied natural <b>gas</b>, hydroelectric power and even fibre optic cable.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This
 would be a win-win situation. The First Nations would be part of any 
government/industry decision-making process with the prospect of 
obtaining ongoing employment, revenue and assurance their environmental 
conditions would be met. In return, energy companies would get a 
"pre-approved" First Nations corridor through which pipelines and other 
infrastructure could run. Government and industry would have the 
certainty missing from other projects, the now defunct Enbridge Northern
 Gateway and the now approved <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline, still opposed by some First Nations and environmentalists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consultations followed 
among the nine native bands along the corridor and, with time, won broad
 acceptance. They created a governing body, the Chiefs' Council, and a 
company, Eagle Spirit Energy, as its operational arm. B.C.'s Aquilini 
Investment Group provided the seed money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chiefs' Council did 
not have far to look for inspiration. Alaska's petroleum development 
has, from the beginning, been a partnership among government, industry, 
community and indigenous peoples. As part of the process, the <span class="companylink">United States government</span>
 created 12 regional profit-making native corporations. These were 
designed to give its indigenous peoples the means to ensure their 
financial independence through their corporate ownership of large tracts
 of land and the opportunity to develop that land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Arctic Slope Regional Corporation</span> represents 11,000 Alaskan Inupiat; it is now the largest Alaskan-owned company with 10,000 employees. The <span class="companylink">Chugach Alaska Corporation</span>,
 with 5,000 miles of coastline along the Gulf of Alaska, represents 
Aleut, Inuit, and Native American stakeholders. Through its companies, 
Chugach designed, built, and operates the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. Its 
spill response and maintenance operations have made it one of the 
world's largest spill preparedness and response organizations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed B.C.-Alberta
 energy corridor mirrors this approach. It is built on the premise that 
First Nations must be engaged in a meaningful way from the start in 
development, design, construction and operation with a strong focus on 
environmental protection, exceeding Canadian regulations. Moreover, the 
council sees the social and economic opportunities offered to First 
Nations by the energy corridor as directly addressing Canada's "agenda 
for reconciliation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is paradoxical that 
the major impediment to the corridor's ongoing development comes from 
the very federal government which has made reconciliation one of its top
 priorities. On May 12, 2017, the government introduced Bill C-48, the 
Oil Tanker Moratorium Act, which is still before <span class="companylink">Parliament</span>.
 The proposed moratorium will apply to all large crude oil shipments by 
tanker from ports along the B.C. coast and inland areas north of 
Vancouver Island (what the government refers to as the "Great Bear 
Rainforest" and "Great Bear Sea") as well as Haida Guaii. The rainforest
 includes the coastal and inland territory of the Lax Kw'Alaams, in 
fact, the very location where they envisaged a tanker terminal. The 
act's stated objective is to "provide extra protection for B.C.'s 
pristine northern coastline."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moratorium has been 
in the works for a decade. In 2010, Liberal MP Joyce Murray, now 
parliamentary secretary to the president of the Treasury Board, 
introduced a private member's bill to legislate a tanker ban on the West
 Coast. Her bill was one of five introduced by the Liberals or NDP 
between 2007 and 2011. Their stated objective was to stop the 
development of Enbridge's Northern Gateway oil pipeline and Kitimat 
terminal. These bills all failed once the Conservatives gained a 
minority government in 2006. Shortly after coming to power in 2015, 
Prime Minister Trudeau gave Transport Minister Marc Garneau a "top 
priority" mandate to formalize such a moratorium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The previous bills 
proposed banning tankers sailing within the defined waters of what is 
known as Canada's "Fishing Zone 3," stretching from the northern tip of 
Vancouver Island to the Alaska Panhandle. Bill C-48, on the other hand, 
prohibits tankers carrying crude oil from entering or leaving ports in 
the same area. In focusing on the use of Canadian ports, the government 
has avoided a possible confrontation with the United States, which has 
protested Canada's claim that Fishing Zone 3 constitutes Canadian 
internal waters. The rather odd result under the new bill is that 
tankers carrying crude can still ply these waters as long as they do not
 enter or leave from a Canadian port. The legislation does not apply to 
tankers transporting refined oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This, in turn, raises the
 question why such legislation is required at all. It does not apply to 
B.C.'s southern waters including the Strait of Juan de Fuca used by 
Alaskan crude oil tankers headed for Puget Sound or to the Port of 
Vancouver/Burnaby, the site of the Kinder-Morgan tanker terminal now 
approved by the federal government. Enbridge's Northern Gateway project 
was cancelled by the government this year. In sum, the only pipeline and
 terminal project the Moratorium Act would affect is the First Nations' 
Eagle Spirit Energy Corridor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On December 9, 2015, 
Helen Johnson, chair of the Chiefs' Council, wrote to Trudeau to request
 an urgent meeting to discuss the proposed moratorium legislation. She 
stated the government's "unilateral tanker moratorium...did not involve 
consultation with First Nations who have been stewards of the lands and 
waters since time immemorial and who have a right to access economic 
opportunities on our lands." No meeting took place. Almost a year later 
the Lax Kw' Alaams Hereditary Chiefs asked the Prime Minister's Office 
for consultations before implementing a moratorium. They underlined the 
importance of environmental protection while meeting their social and 
economic needs in an area with 90 per cent unemployment. Again, no 
meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Liberals 
subsequently introduced the legislation in May, the same chiefs issued a
 declaration on September 28, 2017. It said that the moratorium 
encompassing the Great Bear Rainforest, which includes their traditional
 tribal lands, was "done without any prior consultation or consent" as 
required under Canada's constitution and upheld by the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>.
 As a result, "the Oil Tanker Moratorium Act... has no application or 
effect in our traditional territories." They concluded "such initiatives
 run counter to Prime Minister Trudeau's supposed reconciliation 
commitment to a new relationship with Indigenous Peoples one based on 
the recognition of rights, respect, co-operation and partnership."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's time to put a moratorium on the Moratorium Act.</p>

 the $7.4-billion pipeline expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arguing Burnaby is intentionally delaying construction, the company has asked the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>
 to intervene and allow for work to begin. That city counters it is

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta will throw its support behind <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> before the <span class="companylink">NEB</span>, which may review the case through written submissions or a short hearing.</p>

Greater Vancouver Board of Trade Nov. 30, her audience will likely be 
sympathetic, but it will give her a platform to reach other British 
Columbians who can be swayed, as she attracts local media attention,

environmental and natural resource policy, also warned that "First 
Nation and environmental opponents to the pipeline will do their best to
 greet Notley and make sure their message continues to get attention as 
well."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley said her 
government - which has attempted to secure support for pipelines by 
imposing a climate change agenda that includes a carbon tax and cap on 
oilsands emissions - has "reasonable levels of credibility" among 
Canadians who are concerned about the environment.</p>

argues she should have invited him and other opposition MLAs to join her

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Panda said he believes Notley genuinely backs the oil and <b>gas</b>
 industry, but he questioned her decision making, having appointed 
environmentalists Tzeporah Berman and Karen Mahon to an oilsands 
advisory panel.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If
 Alberta Premier Rachel Notley wants to continue to dismiss opposition 
to pipelines by her federal and British Columbia NDP counterparts, it 
may be time to make the federal and provincial branches of the NDP 
separate entities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike such political 
parties as the Liberals, the New Democrats are integrated at the 
provincial and federal levels. So when Albertans sign up to support 
Notley and her colleagues, they automatically become members of the 
federal NDP.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why it's strange to hear Notley say federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh's hostility toward pipelines is of no consequence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm not going to get too
 wrapped up in what people who are not in government are doing in other 
parts of the country, in hypothetical conversations, over which they 
have no agency," Notley said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certainly, it's true that as the leader of the third largest party in <span class="companylink">Parliament</span>,
 Singh isn't in a position to give a green light or red light to energy 
projects, but the optics are terrible. Notley's federal leader is going 
around the country whipping up opposition to projects her government 
says are not only in Alberta's interest, but in the national interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More jarringly, British Columbia NDP's Premier John Horgan has pledged to use every tool at his disposal to block the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline expansion, which was approved by the federal government and his predecessor, Christy Clark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not uncommon to have
 disagreements within families, but surely it's untenable to have NDP 
colleagues working against each other in such bold fashion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Singh was in Vancouver on
 Friday, where he said he has three criteria that must be met for any 
energy projects to be approved - that Indigenous rights are respected, 
that Canada can meet its climate change goals if the pipeline goes 
ahead, and that the projects prioritize local jobs. Neither Trans 
Mountain nor the now-shelved Energy East projects met those criteria, 
said Singh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the federal leader praised the Notley government initiatives directed at reducing greenhouse <b>gas</b>
 emissions. "It needs to be pointed out, Premier Notley has the most 
aggressive and comprehensive climate change policy in Canada. We won't 
achieve our climate goals if we don't have a premier like Rachel Notley 
in Alberta," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ah, that would be the same climate change plan that was supposed to earn Alberta's NDP government the so-called <b>social licence</b> for pipelines - support that hasn't been forthcoming from the federal and BC. NDP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If these branches of the party have such different views, perhaps it's time to separate the organizations.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MONTREAL, Oct. 19, 2017 /CNW Telbec/ -&nbsp;The drop in oil and <b>gas</b>
 investment and the abandonment of projects like the Energy East 
pipeline may well get worse in Canada due to the erosion of our 
competitive position relative to the United States. This is the main 
conclusion of a Research Paper published today by the MEI.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are less and less 
competitive. This year alone, four large projects worth a total of $84 
billion were abandoned," notes Germain Belzile, Senior Associate 
Researcher and author of the publication. "Investors are shunning Canada
 and choosing the United States. American oil and <b>gas</b> investments are expected to increase by 38% this year compared to 2016, while in Canada the expected increase is just 19%."</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, many American policies are more welcoming for companies, and could become even more so. Whereas the <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> continues to reduce regulations in all sectors, including the oil and <b>gas</b> sector, it is estimated that the cost of the regulatory burden in Alberta will have increased by between 12% and 21% by 2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"After only ten days in 
power, the Trump administration had already issued 37 different 
resolutions through Congress aimed at repealing dozens of regulations. 
This topped what the House of Representatives had undertaken in any of 
its two-year mandates during the Clinton, Bush Jr., and Obama 
presidencies," explains Mr. Belzile. "This shows how urgent it is for 
Canada to act."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, our American 
neighbours are planning a major reform of corporate taxation, which 
would change the situation significantly, especially for Alberta, which 
is already experiencing a slowdown of investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The only big advantage 
that Canada has is its tax regime, but if the Americans reduce their 
federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 20%, it will end up 
hurting us," adds Mr. Belzile. "To keep from lose more ground, Canada 
should adopt a proportional tax rate of 10.5% for all businesses, 
instead of this rate being reserved for SMEs. This reform would allow us
 to maintain this advantage."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other solutions should be
 pursued in order to raise the competitiveness of the country. The 
federal and provincial governments should among other things agree upon 
the maximum duration of project assessments and delimit the notion of <b>social licence</b> by limiting consultations to the communities directly affected by a project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The oil and natural <b>gas</b>
 sector is central to Canadian prosperity, with annual production valued
 at $100&nbsp;billion and employing nearly 200,000 people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The federal government has taken the threats to the <span class="companylink">North American Free Trade Agreement</span>
 very seriously. It is distressing to see that this is still not the 
case when it comes to the threats that are already undermining the 
essential oil and <b>gas</b> sector. It is high time to get back on track," concludes Michel Kelly-Gagnon, President and CEO of the MEI.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Research Paper entitled Canada's Oil and <b>Gas</b>
 Sector at Risk? How Excessive Taxes and Regulations Undermine Our 
Competitiveness was prepared by Germain Belzile, Senior Associate

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be nice to think that the cancellation was a sign of corporate social responsibility, that <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>
 realized the harms (real and anticipated) of the Energy East pipeline 
were not worth the risk to future generations. One can always hope for 
such enlightenment, but no doubt this played a minor role compared to 
the fact that someone, finally, did the math.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investing in pipelines 
these days is like investing in new whaling vessels in the late 19th 
century. People did not stop using whale oil lamps because we ran out of
 sperm whales, but because there was a smarter (and eventually cheaper) 
alternative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the same way, I recall
 Saudi oil minister Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani's famous 1973 line about 
how the Stone Age did not end because people ran out of stones. The age 
of oil will not end when people run out of oil, but when people realize 
there are smarter, eventually cheaper, and more ecologically sustainable
 alternatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pipelines need both a 
source of oil and customers to buy the finished product. One without the
 other is pointless. The current systems (leaks and all) are managing 
current levels of supply and demand. New pipelines are a huge investment
 in a future in which oil prices will be high enough to justify 
collecting and refining the tar sands crude — something that implies an 
increasing demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apart from inconvenient 
truths — such as that there is enough carbon buried in the tar sands to 
guarantee extinction by global warming of much of the life on Earth, 
including our own — the idea of an oil-needy future is seriously 
delusionary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simply put, it is bad 
business. I would love some forensic accounting of who is invested in 
these operations right now, because I suspect the money of those in 
charge of the fossil-fuel industry is invested elsewhere. Mutual funds, 
pension plans and other things that are supposed to guarantee our 
personal economic future, are likely the shills still paying for 
obsolete fossil-fuel technological infrastructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pull the direct and 
indirect government subsidies out of the fossil fuel industry and that 
investment becomes even more dubious. In a warming world in which 
increasing greenhouse <b>gas</b> emissions are the harbinger of disasters, from droughts to forest fires and to hurricanes, even <span class="companylink">General Motors</span>
 is making a major shift to electric vehicles. Proposing expanded 
investment in the fossil-fuel industry would be as popular with 
shareholders these days as trying to corner the market on whale oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, we are not 
just talking about shareholders anymore. We also need to consider the 
stakeholders, the people whose lives are affected by the operations of 
any business, whether or not they have an investment in it. Customers, 
neighbours and citizens near and far can be affected by what a business 
does.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any business has more than a commercial licence to operate. It also has a <b>social licence</b>.
 In effect, we give permission to corporations to operate the way they 
do. As consumers and citizens realize the damage that can be done to the
 health and well-being of their communities, their children and their 
futures, they are demanding changes and improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <b>social licence</b> 
can be withdrawn — by boycotts, any number of legislative barriers and 
by people refusing to work for or buy from a company that does terrible 
things. As we watch the future crumble because of the inaction of 
governments, the irresponsibility of corporate interests and the blind 
selfishness of everyone for themselves, something has to change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> was wise to get out of the way when it did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I wish the federal 
government had led the way on this decision, though, instead of ducking 
and dodging. Jim Carr, our minister of pipelines, has been more 
concerned about the greenhouse <b>gas</b> emission consequences of 
American cuts to the EnergyStar certification program than about 
building renewable energy infrastructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The path to a sustainable
 future does not depend upon our having energy-efficient dishwashers. We
 need to leave the oil in the ground and find another way, which is what
 other countries and industries are doing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remember Sheikh Yamani? 
Last February, Saudi Arabia announced an investment of US$30 to US$50 
billion in renewable energy — and the Saudis are not running out of oil.</p>
