<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it pretty much sums up the <span class="companylink">Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development</span>'s (<span class="companylink">OECD</span>) forecast for Canada's economy for at least the next couple of years.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Paris-based <span class="companylink">OECD</span>
 (essentially the membership organization of the world's developed 
countries) said Monday our GDP growth will be OK- not great, but not a 
recession, either. Employment growth will be slow, so will any rise in 
incomes, but at least unemployment shouldn't increase and inflation 
won't be out of control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All-in-all, Canada's economy will be, well, "meh."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why? Taxes and regulations, but mostly taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2015, when the 
Liberals and New Democrats took over in Ottawa and Edmonton, 
respectively, federal and provincial taxes on individuals and 
corporations have sucked much life out of our economy, along with insane
 new environmental regulations that are scaring away foreign investment 
in our energy sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, the <span class="companylink">OECD</span> also points to uncertainty about <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>. So Trump haters can blame Donald Trump's trade strategy a bit, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in recent years, federal and provincial governments have raised taxes so much that Canada has become less competitive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report, also Monday, for the Alberta government, <span class="companylink">Export Development Canada</span>, the <span class="companylink">Petroleum Services Association of Canada</span>,
 Canadian Global Exploration Forum and JWN, an energy industry media 
group, determined the best investment opportunities for Canadian oil 
companies were in ... the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How ironic. A report for 
the Alberta government and the federal government's export agency is 
encouraging Canadian companies to ship their money south.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crazy public policies are
 acting like rocks on the tail of the Canadian economic bird, changes 
such as subjecting any new energy development to "genderbased 
assessments" or making pipelines responsible for all the emissions 
created by the oil they carry, even emissions from the oil after it 
leaves the <b>pipeline</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But according to the <span class="companylink">OECD</span>,
 the biggest problem the Canadian economy has at the moment is taxes. We
 are raising ours rapidly while our largest trading partners, the 
Americans, have radically reduced at least their corporate taxes since 
last November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Alberta, for instance, the top corporate tax rates have increased by 50% since Premier Rachel Notley and the NDP took over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta Advantage is gone. Alberta's corporate tax rate is now as high as most other provinces'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the Harper 
government, Ottawa worked hard to make Canada's tax rates slightly lower
 than American rates. That resulted in corporate investment shifting 
northward for a decade or so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now the combination of uncompetitive tax rates, huge government deficits and "<b>social licence</b>" regulations has scared away tens of billions of investment dollars (along with the jobs those dollars would have created).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stubbornness of the B.C. government surrounding the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b>
 - and the unwillingness of the Trudeau Liberals to do anything strong 
about B.C.'s obstructionism - has foreign investors worried, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's one last insanity 
that is contributing to our "meh" performance: Fossil fuels brought into
 Canada are not subjected to carbon taxes or wacky environmental regs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millions of tonnes of 
U.S. coal are shipped to Asia each year through the Port of Vancouver 
without ever being charged a cent of federal or provincial carbon tax. 
The B.C. government, which is doing everything it can to stop Alberta 
oil, does nothing to limit dirtier U.S. coal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, none of the 
700,000 barrels of foreign oil imported into Canada every day is 
subjected to the environmental regulations every ounce of Western 
Canadian oil must meet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why would foreign 
investors pump money into Canada, only to have their oil or coal blocked
 and their income taxed through the nose, when they can import fossil 
fuels and get around the taxes?</p>

 pundits should not be so quick to write off the new Doug Ford-Scott Moe
 alliance against the federal carbon tax. Yes, they were the only two of
 the 10 provincial premiers in New Brunswick this week to announce their
 support for a constitutional challenge to the federal law. And yes 
constitutional experts are correct in predicting that this legal 
challenge is not likely to succeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But winning in the legal 
battle does not mean winning the policy war. Obstructionist provincial 
governments can gum up federal policies whose effective implementation 
require provincial co-operation. Witness how B.C. Premier John Horgan 
and his antipipeline allies have succeeded in delaying the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> <b>pipeline</b> expansion despite losing 17 consecutive court decisions.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With
 respect to the carbon tax, the law may be on the side of Ottawa, but 
time and politics are not. Saskatchewan's reference to its court of 
appeal won't be decided for another nine months. Whoever loses will 
appeal to the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>, 
which will take another year or more to be heard and then decided. By 
then, there will have been a spring election in Alberta and a federal 
election in the fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Alberta, Conservative 
leader Jason Kenney is promising to scrap that province's carbon tax if 
he wins next year's election. All current polling suggests that he will.
 Manitoba has adopted its own version of a carbon tax, but the price it 
places on CO2 is below the minimum demanded by the federal plan. Premier
 Pallister has warned that if Ottawa tries to force it higher, "we'll 
see you in court." P.E.I. has adopted a climate change plan with no 
carbon tax - a policy that clearly does not meet federal regulations. 
And if anti-tax momentum builds, the Newfoundland and New Brunswick 
premiers have warned that they are not going to impose a tax on their 
voters that consumers and businesses in six or seven other provinces are
 not paying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With next year's federal 
election fast approaching, this is potential nightmare scenario for 
Trudeau and the Liberals. Do they want to make the ballot-issue a new 
tax that will make it more expensive for voters to fill up their cars, 
heat their homes and turn on their lights? Maybe this won't make any 
difference in Saskatchewan and Alberta, where the Liberals only have 
five MPs. But in Ontario - where Doug Ford just won by promising to 
scrap the tax - the Liberals have 80 MPs seeking reelection. Losing even
 a quarter of these would jeopardize their 183-seat government, which is
 only 13 over the 170 minimum required for a majority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2015, many 
centre-right voters supported Trudeau simply because they were tired of 
Stephen Harper. But in 2018, they supported Doug Ford because they were 
tired of skyrocketing electricity and gas prices. If in 2019 Trudeau 
takes a hardline on bringing back the very carbon tax that Premier Ford 
has just repealed, he risks losing some of these former supporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the alternative - 
backing off on the carbon tax - has its own risks. Promising action on 
climate change was one of the issues that helped Trudeau win in 2015. 
With the help of the U.S.-financed environmental NGO (EN-GO) Leadnow, 
the Liberals targeted 29 Conservative-held ridings in which their 
polling indicated that climate change was a priority for voters. Liberal
 candidates subsequently won 25 of these seats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these same 
centre-left voters that supported Trudeau in 2015 are no longer so happy
 with him. Many are angry about the federal government's $4.5-billion 
bailout of the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> <b>pipeline</b>
 expansion in B.C. If Trudeau now backs down on his national carbon tax 
pledge, many of his 2015 supporters for whom climate action is still a 
priority may drift off to the NDP in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underlying the Liberals'carbon tax dilemma is the spectacular failure of the Trudeau-Notley "<b>social licence</b>"
 gambit: their belief that in return for their various carbon reduction 
policies, climate change ENGOs would acquiesce in Canada's economic need
 to build the Kinder Morgan Trans-Mountain expansion. Whatever 
plausibility this trade-off strategy may have had initially has now been
 destroyed. The anti-Kinder Morgan forces - the Horgan government, U.S. 
and Canadian climate ENGOs and B.C. Aboriginal groups - have accelerated
 their opposition to TransMountain, not backed off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor are they shy about explaining why. When CBC asked Bill Mc-Kibben, founder of <span class="companylink">350.org</span>,
 why he would not give Trudeau and Notley any credit for Canada's carbon
 reduction policies, he stated a simple fact: that at only two per cent 
of global emissions, what Canada does on the domestic "demand" side to 
reduce our emissions is too small to make any difference. What will make
 a difference, McKibben continued, is preventing the further development
 of the Canadian oil sands - the third largest reserve on the world. "To
 stop the oil sands, we have to stop all pipelines."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The failure of his <b>social licence</b> strategy forced Trudeau to rescue the TransMountain expansion with the $4.5-billion purchase of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada</span>.
 This did not win him many new friends in Alberta or Saskatchewan, but 
infuriated many of his erstwhile climate change supporters in Ontario 
and British Columbia. With an election only a year away, the carbon tax 
issue threatens to push the Liberals even deeper into a political corner
 with no easy way out.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario Premier Doug Ford
 is using his first appearance at a gathering of premiers to assemble a 
national coalition to fight the federal government's climate plan in 
court, setting up a direct challenge to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less
 than three weeks after his swearing-in, the rookie Progressive 
Conservative Premier has taken his province from a stalwart supporter of
 carbon taxes to a fierce opponent, upsetting the balance on the issue 
that Mr. Trudeau reached with premiers more than two years ago in 
Vancouver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That deal led the federal
 government to pass legislation this year that will impose a national 
carbon tax in provinces that have not set up an equivalent 
carbon-pricing regime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ford is scrapping the
 cap-andtrade system his predecessor introduced, and now wants to stop 
Ottawa from imposing a carbon tax on Ontario and other provinces that 
don't want one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with Saskatchewan, 
which has already promised a legal battle against any federal carbon 
tax, Mr. Ford will court other provincial leaders at the meeting who 
might become allies in a showdown that could end up at the Supreme 
Court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Premier Ford is not 
sitting back on this," Ontario Environment Minister Rod Phillips said on
 Wednesday. “He's going to be in New Brunswick, talking to other 
premiers – the meetings are arranged – talking to them about the plan to
 chop this Trudeau carbon tax. It's important to this country."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manitoba's Premier told 
The Globe and Mail on Wednesday his province is not interested in 
joining a court fight. Mr. Ford was to meet with Saskatchewan Premier 
Scott Moe on Wednesday evening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a changing environment," Mr. Moe said of the provincial political landscape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premiers began arriving 
at a seaside resort in Saint Andrews, N.B., with a wide range of 
pressing issues on their minds in addition to the climate file.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the meeting, 
various premiers said they want to discuss pipelines, federal 
equalization payments, a national pharmacare plan, cannabis 
legalization, immigration and reducing internal trade barriers. But a 
provincial response to the federal climate-change legislation will be 
among the most pressing items on the agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ford government 
expects to table environmental legislation later this summer to repeal 
the cap-and-trade system former Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne 
introduced. During the election campaign, Mr. Ford promised to spend 
$500-million over four years to increase inspections of major polluters,
 invest in new technology and reduce garbage in city parks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saskatchewan launched a 
constitutional challenge earlier this year arguing that the federal 
government does not have jurisdiction to impose a federal carbon price. 
Mr. Ford has indicated he wants to join that case or launch a similar 
one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview with The 
Globe, Mr. Moe said the Ontario election results and recent comments 
from the PEI government questioning Ottawa's climate plans suggest there
 is growing concern from provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said new carbon taxes 
hurt Canadian businesses at a time when they are concerned about staying
 competitive with the United States, where Washington has cut U.S. taxes
 and imposed tariffs on imports from Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We will have a good 
discussion on competitiveness, including ineffective policies such as 
carbon taxation, of which province after province seems to be coming to 
that realization as the deadlines loom," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Brunswick Premier 
Brian Gallant, the summit host, plans to let Ottawa impose a carbon tax,
 and has established a climatechange fund using revenue from the 
province's existing gasoline tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">British Columbia, Alberta
 and Quebec remain as large provinces that have already adopted a carbon
 price and support the national plan. However, Quebec's Liberal 
government is trailing in the polls with an election coming on Oct. 1. 
Alberta Premier Rachel Notley's NDP government faces a vote early next 
year, and her chief rival, Jason Kenney of the United Conservative 
Party, is a staunch carbon-tax critic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supporters of a national price on carbon have said it would give governments the <b>social licence</b> to approve new pipelines, but B.C. and Alberta are bitterly divided over the planned expansion of the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> <b>pipeline</b>, which Ottawa agreed to buy earlier this year in an effort to ensure it goes ahead.</p>

Ontario and Saskatchewan in taking Ottawa to court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I know that the federal 
government is very serious about their [carbon-tax] backstop. We got 
constitutional, legal, expert advice that told us they are in their 
realm of authority, and so ‘Just say no' [to] Trudeau isn't an answer 
for Manitoba," Mr. Pallister said. “We've designed our own plan. We 
believe our plan will work better."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Phillips made his 
comments on Wednesday as he hosted his first formal meeting with his 
federal counterpart, Catherine McKenna.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal Environment 
Minister did not pass up an opportunity to take a shot at Ontario's 
Progressive Conservatives, saying they “don't seem to have a plan" to 
tackle climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you don't have a 
climate plan, you also don't have a plan for the economy," she said, 
adding later that “I've still got to do my job [and I] explained to 
Minister Phillips that we spent a year negotiating a climate plan."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenge for premiers will be to achieve any cohesive decisions by the time the gathering wraps up on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pallister said he's 
hoping the concern over rising protectionism around the world will push 
the premiers to finally act on eliminating the many trade barriers that 
still exist between provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We've got a real opportunity here to take barriers down that really shouldn't have been there," Mr. Pallister said.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It
 was disappointing, but not unexpected, to read NDP Environment Minister
 Shannon Phillips's brazen defence of the NDP's carbon tax in these 
pages this past Saturday ("On climate change, Albertans expect their 
leaders to lead", June 23, 2018).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP's carbon tax was always just a government cash grab - one that comes with considerable expense to Albertans.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While
 the NDP minister talks about "the interests of everyday Alberta 
families" in her column, the reality is that the "the interests of 
everyday Alberta families" are a lot more expensive with the carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From heightened costs for
 schools to keep the lights on, to Albertans facing an added cost at the
 pumps on top of an already high fuel cost just for the crime of getting
 to work or driving for groceries, the carbon tax affects everybody in 
Alberta. Ms. Phillips claimed that the carbon tax is needed "to secure 
future growth and market access through new pipelines."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the NDP sprung their surprise carbon tax on Albertans, not one <b>pipeline</b> opponent has moved from "No" to "Yes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's what has happened: the federal Liberal government stopped the Northern Gateway <b>pipeline</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They tampered with the regulatory process and stopped the Energy East <b>pipeline</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The previous U.S. administration halted the Keystone XL <b>pipeline</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, of course, British 
Columbia's NDP government has been fighting tooth and nail to stop the 
Trans Mountain Expansion Project, a much-needed, job-creating project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, extreme activist groups remain determined to illegally obstruct the Trans Mountain expansion project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of these groups or governments received the memo about the carbon tax and <b>social licence</b>, apparently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are the NDP's fellow travellers obstructing the <b>pipeline</b>:
 including some of those organizing illegal protests, Tzeporah Berman 
and Karen Mahon, who Alberta's NDP government actually named to their 
oilsands advisory group; or <span class="companylink">Greenpeace</span> ringleader Mike Hudema, with whom Minister Phillips collaborated on a how-to book on stopping resource projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In her column, the NDP minister did find room to attribute Calgary's Green Line LRT to the carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She fails to mention that
 federal funding for the Green Line LRT came under the former federal 
Conservative government, announced by Jason Kenney in mid-2015, and 
there was no condition of a carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP's carbon tax, 
from the start, has been a false bag of goods: they never campaigned on 
it, they just imposed it right after taking office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2015, the premier 
claimed that revenue collected through the carbon tax would never go to 
pad the government's deficit-heavy budgets, but that's exactly where 
it's going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As time passes, the only 
defence the NDP seems to have for their carbon tax cash grab is to try 
and guilt Albertans into supporting it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've said it before and 
I'll say it again: I know that Albertans are smarter than that, and I 
know they do not believe for a minute that the only way to address 
climate change is through a carbon tax.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On
 March 18, 2016, Canada's Minister of Finance, Bill Morneau, established
 the Advisory Council on Economic Growth and charged it with the 
development of advice on concrete policy actions to help create the 
conditions for strong and sustained long-term economic growth. More than
 a year later, how well has the government done with that advice? If we 
look at the council's first report Bringing Foreign Investment to 
Canada, it put emphasis on the importance of attracting foreign 
investment, which is certainly a worthy goal. The report stated that 
"Foreign direct investment (FDI) is a critical driver of economic 
growth...</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
 it strengthens Canadian productive capacity through knowledge transfer,
 the development of human capital, and new technology, management 
techniques, and production processes." It recommends the establishment 
of a Foreign Direct Investment Agency, which "in its first few years of 
operation, can raise the growth rate of inbound FDI from its current two
 per cent to six per cent annually... and would add approximately $43 
billion to Canada's GDP - an amount currently equal to two per cent of 
our national income."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, what's the Liberal 
government's record to date on attracting foreign direct investment? The
 accompanying graph is worth a thousand words. It shows that, in fact, 
since 2013 the inflow of FDI fell substantially, and the pace has only 
accelerated after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government 
took office in 2015. The amount reached a low of $30 billion in 2017 and
 is likely to decrease further in 2018. The purchase by the <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span> of the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> <b>pipeline</b> business alone will reduce the amount by over $4 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Important also is the 
amount of FDI made by Canadians abroad, instead of being invested here 
at home. The graph shows that outflows, too, have increased steadily 
since 2011 and reached a record $100 billion in 2017. As a result, in 
that year the balance of Canada's FDI account (outflows minus inflows) 
was about negative $4 billion. A far cry from what the government had 
planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the importance of 
FDI for economic growth, these statistics make it clear we need to 
understand why this deterioration in Canada's FDI account took place. 
Some causes are developments beyond our government's control, such as 
recent reductions in U.S. corporate income tax rates and regulations, 
lower oil and gas prices, and the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate
 accord.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, much blame for this deterioration stems from recent Canadian policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As discussed recently in these pages by Jack Mintz and William Robson, and in a recent <span class="companylink">Fraser Institute</span> publication by Niels Veldhuis, Milagros Palacios and Jason Clemens, these policies worsened the investment climate in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This worsening resulted 
from the increase in environmental and climate policies such as: The 
mandated closing of coal-fired electricitygenerating plants in Ontario 
(and the rapid rise in electricity prices that followed); the capping of
 future extraction of oil in Alberta; and the prohibition of tanker 
traffic along the northern coast of British Columbia and of pipelines in
 B.C.'s Great Bear Rainforest. There was also the imposition of stricter
 conditions on the construction of pipelines to prevent oil spills and 
the requirement to obtain "<b>social licence</b>" before one could be built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worsening of the 
investment climate is also due to the pursuit of the "progressive" 
political agenda in vogue lately across Canada, including: Heavier 
regulation of equity policies in pay and employment; increases in 
minimum wages; and restrictions on property development and the 
imposition of more stringent building codes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most important 
element of this progressive agenda has been the increase in taxes on 
corporations and high-income individuals and the prospect of still 
higher taxes through rising carbon taxes. Since an important part of the
 cost of the progressive agenda is covered by deficits, the growing debt
 portends even higher taxes in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly politicians and 
some proportion of Canadians are certain to consider the costs of these 
policies to be worth the benefits brought by improvements in 
environmental protection, the prevention of global warming and better 
social conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upcoming federal and 
provincial elections, like the one that just decimated the Liberals in 
Ontario, will continue to reveal how prevalent this view is among 
voters.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is
 it just coincidence that relations with Western Canada become so badly 
frayed when people named Trudeau happen to be prime minister, or is it 
possible there's more to it than that? You'd have a hard time convincing
 many Albertans that Justin Trudeau is any sort of improvement over his 
deeply disliked father. The Trudeau Liberals'epic mishandling of the <b>pipeline</b>
 crisis - which wasn't really a crisis until they turned it into one - 
already had backs up across the province when Albertans discovered 
they'd been hoodwinked by a surprise federal move to cement the 
widelydisliked equalization program in place for another five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don Braid, the veteran 
Calgary Herald columnist not usually prone to hyperbole, reflected the 
depth of the resulting anger when he wrote that the move indicates 
"Canada is rigged."</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Rarely
 has there been a sneakier ploy than the Trudeau government's unilateral
 renewal of the current equalization system without formal notice to 
provinces or the public," Braid wrote. "Everybody involved looks either 
secretive or stupid. Except the feds, who are just sneaky, all in the 
traditional interest of refusing to change a system rigged against 
Alberta."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's anger is 
understandable. It has endured five years of deeply trying times as oil 
prices collapsed, gutting its economy, with Ottawa offering little 
beyond words in assistance. But western grievances aren't limited to a 
province that rarely welcomes Liberals in any case. Trudeau's government
 is at loggerheads with British Columbia over the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> <b>pipeline</b>
 mess, heading to a confrontation with Saskatchewan over Ottawa's carbon
 tax dictates, and facing a return to the days when you could fly from 
Ontario's border to the Pacific without crossing more than a handful of 
Liberal outposts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's notable about the 
situation is how comprehensively the Liberals have created the problems 
for themselves. If Trudeau and his top honchos had deliberately set out 
to create a <b>pipeline</b> problem, they couldn't have done any better.
 Trudeau claimed to support the Keystone XL project in the U.S. but paid
 little beyond lip service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When President Barack 
Obama killed it, he offered barely a murmur of complaint, noting he was 
"disappointed ... but respect(s) the right of the United States to make 
the decision." The Liberals blocked Northern Gateway, introduced a 
regulatory regime certain to confound future projects, watched Energy 
East die, and all but issued a veto to anti-oil activists by jabbering 
blithely about the importance of "<b>social licence</b>," a term you don't often hear from the embattled prime minister anymore. Ottawa only got serious about <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 when the company forced the issue; now Canadians are stuck with the 
costs, and a B.C. government that's just as adamant as ever about 
ensuring it never gets built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While fumbling that file,
 the Liberals'determination to impose a national carbon plan is showing 
every sign of backfiring. B.C.'s New Democrats have turned that 
province's existing tax into a straightforward money grab, making a 
prophet of every critic who claimed governments, no matter how 
well-meaning, would twist the plan into just another way to collect and 
spend money. By this time next year Ottawa could face premiers united 
from Ontario west in opposition to the federal scheme and willing to go 
to the mat to block it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One would think that, 
with those fissures already in place, Ottawa would be wary about opening
 another against western interests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But no. Buried deep - 
very deep - in the fine print of the latest Liberal budget was a 
paragraph indicating equalization would be extended for five years until
 2024. It was oddly worded, didn't show up until page 319 of a 369-page 
document, and evidently slipped past provincial leaders and others 
assigned to decipher Ottawa's intentions. Despite knowing both 
Saskatchewan and Alberta were preparing to argue for substantial changes
 before the program could be renewed, no consultations were offered and 
no apparent efforts made to flag the decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finance Minister Bill 
Morneau's office did write to both provinces referring to the renewal 
after the budget had already been introduced, but in terms that somehow 
failed to trigger alarm in either case. He did offer to consult on the 
next renewal, in five years, if he's still in office and the Liberals 
still in power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, technically, Ottawa 
can say its action wasn't totally secret, though considering the 
delicacy of the issue and the importance to the provinces, its handling 
was decidedly curious. In any case, slipping a fast one past a couple of
 finance ministers wasn't going to prevent the eventual outburst when 
the ruse got noticed. If anything, it was only bound to worsen the 
situation by shredding what little trust remained between western 
leaders and federal officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why do it? Are Trudeau
 and Morneau entirely tone-deaf to the West? It's not an outlandish 
suggestion. Morneau may have a respectable business record, but his 
judgment was put in serious question by last year's business tax reform 
shambles, and his personal background is rooted deeply in Ontario's 
Toronto-centric Liberal traditions. Trudeau's B.C. ties date from his 
youth as a freewheeling snowboarder and his brief teaching career; as a 
politician he's decidedly central Canadian in aspect. Of his 184 seats, 
120 are in Ontario and Quebec. He needs to perform well there next year 
to keep his job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equalization is a complex
 program that is easily misunderstood, but the fact that almost $12 
billion of its $19 billion goes to Quebec - a province that never 
hesitates to boast about its advanced nature while somehow eternally 
qualifying as a "have-not" entity - is a matter of justifiable 
frustration, especially in provinces like Alberta and Saskatchewan that 
find their resource-based economies condemn them to second-tier status, 
even in tough times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They wanted to discuss 
the program and propose some changes. Ottawa undercut them in a devious 
manner. Is it something in the Trudeau gene pool? Or just a Liberal 
party that has always struggled to see past Ontario? National Post

 NDP is at it again. This time, pedalling the false notion that a 
rejection of their carbon tax agenda is equal to a rejection of science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These worn out talking points came last week from Steve Williams, president and CEO of Suncor.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking
 at an event in Calgary, Williams stated that "the science of the left 
wing is different that the science of the right wing," and blamed 
conservatives for dividing the public on the issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some wealthy CEOs might 
criticize us for rejecting the NDP's carbon tax, but we are on side with
 the vast majority of Albertans who are forced to bear the costs of this
 government's policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Albertans who don't 
appreciate being shamed by elites who have no trouble making ends meet 
for rejecting a policy that has wreaked havoc on household budgets 
across the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Poll after poll shows 
just how unpopular this carbon tax is, and with good reason - it hasn't 
done a thing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, it simply 
punishes Alberta consumers by increasing the cost of everything from 
heating our homes in the winter to putting gas in the vehicle that gets 
us to work each day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What it has done is drive
 emissions, along with good, mortgage-paying jobs, to jurisdictions 
without a punitive carbon tax regime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We already see energy 
jobs booming in places like North Dakota and Texas, while the oil and 
gas workers in Alberta remain unemployed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact of the matter is
 that Albertans were sold a false bill of goods when the NDP introduced 
its carbon tax - a tax they never campaigned on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were told that it would buy us the so-called "<b>social licence</b>" we needed to get shovels in the ground on a <b>pipeline</b> to tidewater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not one <b>pipeline</b> oppo-nent has become a <b>pipeline</b> supporter as a result of this carbon tax and the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b> project now hangs in the balance, despite the fact that taxpayers have now assumed the financial risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These opponents - the 
same ones the NDP promised would become supporters if we handcuffed our 
economy with a punitive tax on everything - are now doing everything in 
their power to block Trans Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are the elected 
officials in British Columbia that are denying permits and bringing 
progress to a standstill with an endless stream of court challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are the so-called "activists", funded by foreign anti-Alberta interests, that are illegally blocking construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not one of these opponents has been swayed by the Alberta NDP's carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, they are digging their heels in for the long haul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, rather than admit it 
was wrong, the NDP has chosen to smear every Albertan opposed to the 
carbon tax as a climate change 'denier,'a phrase deliberately intended 
to invoke Holocaust denial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone that dares challenge this government on the false logic of "<b>social licence</b>" or raise a question about carbon leakage is branded as backwards and anti-science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, I know that 
Albertans are smarter than that, and I know they do not believe for a 
minute that the only way to address climate change is through a carbon 
tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP would be wise to remember this the next time they feel an urge to insult the people they are supposed to represent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to tens of 
billions of dollars of potential international investment in energy 
projects, "Canada's not even on the radar screen anymore." That's the 
bleak assessment of Rafi Tahmazian, portfolio manager at Canoe 
Financial, as told to reporters earlier this week.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They
 don't even care," Tahmazian said of the big oil companies and 
international fund managers who are avoiding Canada and Alberta like the
 plague.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tahmazian's own billion-dollar portfolio used to be invested just 30 per cent outside Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now fully 60 per cent of the assets he manages are in foreign markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is seen as too unpredictable and too hostile to business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In just three years in 
office, the added taxes, regulations and environmental evangelizing of 
the federal Liberal and provincial New Democrat governments have scared 
away as much as $100 billion in economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, some of the loss 
was due to the collapse in world oil prices in 2014 and 2015. But other 
jurisdictions that were hit with the same collapse have begun to recover
 far faster than Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil-producing states in 
the U.S. are mostly at or above pre-collapse investment and production 
levels, for instance. Meanwhile, according to <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span>, foreign investment in Canada's energy sector dropped by another $30 billion last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2017, when most oil-producing regions of the world were getting back to business, Canada and Alberta saw <span class="companylink">Shell</span>, <span class="companylink">ConocoPhillips</span>, Statoil and Total pull out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, of course, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 effectively pulled out, too. It only doesn't look like they pulled out 
because Ottawa rushed in with $4.5 billion in taxpayer dollars to keep 
up the appearance that the Trans Mountain Expansion project is still a 
viable concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And this week, the <span class="companylink">Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) </span>released
 a report estimating that over the next 10 years, complying with 
environmental regulations will drive up Canadian energy companies'costs 
by another $25 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's $25 billion that 
could have gone into job creation and contracts for smaller service 
companies, equipment purchases, building construction, exploration or 
shareholders' dividends. Instead, it will go to meeting the demands of 
bureaucrats, government regulators and environmental lobbyists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is on top of an 
April report from Scotiabank showing that the lack of pipelines to get 
Canadian oil to ocean-going ports is costing energy companies and 
governments $15 billion a year in lost sales and revenues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is it any wonder that Suncor CEO Steve Williams told The <span class="companylink">Canadian Press</span> this week that despite Ottawa's buyout of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>,
 his company is no more likely to invest in big projects in Canada than 
before the buyout? "Canada is falling behind other jurisdictions in 
terms of competitiveness when it comes to government royalties, taxation
 and confidence in the regulatory system," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Into this gloomy economic picture trots the <span class="companylink">University of Alberta</span>, which Thursday awarded an honorary degree to infamous eco-activist and oilsands detractor, David Suzuki.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two things are related.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of Alberta's and 
Canada's "progressive" politicians have fallen under the spell of 
"green" activists like Suzuki. They have established policies that are 
destroying investor confidence in our energy sector in the name of 
saving the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would you invest in a high-cost, high-risk energy project when the federal government is trying to make <b>pipeline</b>
 approval contingent on gender studies and traditional Indigenous 
knowledge, as much as scientific research? Would you invest when the 
Alberta government wants to add billions in carbon tax to buy "<b>social licence</b>"
 from environmental extremists - licence the extremists will never 
grant? The "green" mentality that has seized our politics (and of which 
Suzuki is a high-profile representative) is exactly what is making 
Canada so utterly unattractive to investors, despite having the 
third-largest oil reserves in the world.</p>

budget, says a Canadian representative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corporation</span>
 (Sinopec), which bills itself as the world’s biggest refiner and 
second-biggest petrochemical producer, was one of China’s big three 
state-owned energy companies that invested in Canada’s oil and gas 
industry this century. The others are <span class="companylink">China National Offshore Oil Corporation</span> (<span class="companylink">CNOOC</span>) and <span class="companylink">PetroChina</span>.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, though, neither has attempted to build any multibillion-dollar projects here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Brian Tuffs, CEO of Sinopec Canada, took part in a panel discussion at a
 Gas Processing Association of Canada (GPAC) lunch on Wednesday. The 
subject was Canada’s natural gas future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuffs, who often travels 
to Sinopec’s Beijing office, responded to a questions about Canada’s 
competitiveness and ability to build major energy projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When I look at Beijing 
... they’re very much in a wait-and-see attitude,” he said, referring to
 perceptions about Canada’s ability to built projects — especially 
megaprojects — on time and on budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Until we actually get 
something committed, and get something completed, I think there is a lot
 of scepticism about Canada’s ability to actually execute on a project,”
 Tuffs told the well-attended Calgary event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to Canadian competitiveness, Tuffs has a fairly unique perspective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sinopec, which has about 
800,000 employees, is active in 26 countries. So Sinopec Canada’s 
proposed capital projects have to compete internally for funding against
 projects around the world. (He said Sinopec’s Canadian production is 
about 60,000-65,000 boe/d, roughly half gas and half oil.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I would say, speaking as
 a CEO of an entity that competes with 26 other countries for funding 
[within Sinopec], that we in Canada struggle to compete [for] capital,” 
Tuffs told the GPAC event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He sought “to dispel any 
lingering myths” about the Chinese government’s commercial priorities, 
arguing that making money doesn’t take a back seat to shipping physical 
barrels to China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our single most 
important corporate target is net free cash flow,” he said. “We want to 
have more money coming in than every last dollar that goes out. And if 
we’re successful, then that’s how we do it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When I talk to the big 
guys over in Beijing, they’ll say, ‘Look Brian, we don’t need 
necessarily for you to provide barrels to China. Make us money. If we 
have money, the world will sell us [oil].’”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: “We operate on a
 100 per cent commercial basis. And we compete internationally against 
all those other international projects.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuffs has witnessed 
China’s fast-paced conversion to natural gas as the government strives 
to improve notoriously bad air quality in cities such as Beijing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He believes Canada, with its vast gas resources and tiny domestic demand, has a “tremendous opportunity.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have a federal 
government which, broadly speaking, would like to build stronger trade 
relations with countries such as China. We share a common Pacific 
coastline with Southeast Asia. So we should be the favoured supplier of 
natural gas to those new markets.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it has to be able to compete on cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think, though, when we look at competitiveness, it’s not just about getting a <b>social licence</b> to do our work. It’s about having a cost structure which is competitive,” Tuffs said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“At the moment, when we look at our markets, our traditional market in the Lower 48. ... We’re at the wrong end of the <b>pipeline</b> to supply the U.S. We’re competing against gas from Texas [and] Louisiana.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in global gas 
markets, Canada’s first LNG export project will have to compete with 
expansions at existing LNG projects — and brownfield projects have a 
cost advantage over greenfield projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There’s no premium that a
 buyer is going to pay for a methane molecule that comes from Canada. 
They’re not going to pay extra because we’ve got a little Maple Leaf or a
 polar bear on our methane,” Tuffs said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What the international 
markets care about is cost and reliability of supply. And those are the 
only two things that as a buyer of LNG, [including] Sinopec, cares 
about. How cheap can I get it? And how reliable is the source?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy costs are 
especially important to China because this key input affects the supply 
costs of the country’s entire industrial chain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If their energy costs go
 too high, then their manufacturing cost becomes too high, and they 
become uncompetitive,” Tuffs said. “And [if] the economy of China 
stalls, [it] has implications ... for the global economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So we need to look at the competitiveness of our cost structure as well as actually getting a <b>social licence</b>.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Susannah Pierce, external relations director of the proposed Kitimat, 
B.C. LNG Canada export project, also stressed the importance of being 
able to compete on cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Royal Dutch Shell plc</span>-led project, which is expected to decide this year on whether to proceed, would be built from scratch at a greenfield site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Most of the other parts 
of the world where we’re competing already have a lot of capital 
infrastructure in the ground,” Pierce told the GPAC lunch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She emphasized the LNG industry is extremely capital intensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are dealing with 
competitors — whether that be the U.S. Gulf Coast [or] Australia [or] 
Qatar — which really are all about expansion. And as we know, expansions
 are less capital intensive, for the most part.”</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government's promise to buy the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b>
 was not ideal, but it was preferable to a total breakdown of the 
project. Nationalization was the federal government's last remaining 
market-access option for Canadian oilsands entirely within its own 
jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That the Trudeau 
government was compelled to resort to this option is a testament to the 
dysfunction of our approval processes for major hydrocarbon 
infrastructure. A project that had all of the requisite regulatory 
approvals and had not to date suffered any substantive reversal in the 
courts was nevertheless deemed by its private capital investors as too 
risky to try completing.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless
 of whether Trans Mountain is actually completed, as the Trudeau 
government promises, and eventually sold to private-sector interests, as
 it also vows to do, the question for reasonable Canadians is what we've
 learned from this outcome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most important lesson
 would be the necessity to restore confidence that regulatory approvals 
in Canada actually mean something. Governments must demonstrate their 
preparedness to resolutely thwart any civil disobedience intended solely
 to obstruct approved infrastructure, to remove legislatively any 
ambiguities on the primacy of federal jurisdiction and to clarify 
legislatively what constitutes adequate consultation with impacted 
stakeholders. This would reduce the claims of inadequate consultation 
that too many courts feel compelled to give credence to long after 
regulatory decisions have been rendered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, the regulatory process does not need more process for its own sake, as the proposed Bill C-69, which overhauls the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>'s
 traditional role, would impose. Instead, Canada needs to restore the 
regulatory process to be primarily a technocratic exercise focused on 
the construction and operation of infrastructure to ensure that 
legitimate stakeholder and environment impacts are mitigated or 
financially accommodated to reasonable global standards. The process 
must be governed by accepted legal standards for standing and the 
probative value of submitted evidence. It cannot be a consensus 
exercise; its function should not be to make policy. Policy 
clarifications should be provided by democratically elected governments 
before the fact, so that the ambiguity of whether a project is in the 
public interest is determined as much as possible early on. Bill C-69 is
 at odds with what would substantively restore investor confidence in 
the regulatory process. The government should stand down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Third, the federal 
government needs to fundamentally clarify its national carbon policy. To
 its credit, it has tried to espouse some balance between what it would 
see as credible climate policy and tolerance for hydrocarbon. It has 
imposed a national pricing standard that is as stringent as any 
currently in place among any of its major trading partners. But it has 
failed to explain that its national carbon-reduction targets are only an
 aspiration, at best, not an inviolate obligation that requires 
constraining growth in hydrocarbon production. That failure has 
emboldened the Canadian environmental movement to resist all hydrocarbon
 infrastructure, contributing to rendering our regulatory approval 
process dysfunctional. The Trudeau government should immediately clarify
 that carbon taxes are the pre-eminent carbon-policy instrument for 
Canada. Paying for carbon is a licence to emit. There is no other "<b>social licence</b>" standard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada cannot afford to 
lose its most economic opportunities to regulatory and political 
failure. We have come perilously close to doing that, leaving the fate 
of so many of our energy project developments uncertain. Prime Minister 
Justin Trudeau in the past castigated the previous government for acting
 as "cheerleaders, not referees" who are "putting their hands on the 
scale" to promote hydrocarbon development. By nationalizing Trans 
Mountain, Trudeau's government has now gone well beyond anything he 
could accuse them of doing. It cannot happen again.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short, he now says he is against it because of the Liberal government's plan to financially back the <b>pipeline</b>, "to benefit private shareholders of a corporation in Texas."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, Mr. Singh, nobody in Alberta or B.C. would benefit from the <b>pipeline</b> during construction or following completion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And like the NDP has ever worried about taxpayers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previously, the seatless leader of the federal NDP had called for a further environmental review of the <b>pipeline</b> - never mind the thing has already been studied to death and approved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He appears to have

 was a very difficult decision for me. It wasn't something I took 
lightly but leaders have to make tough decisions."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the fact there

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTERRE SETTLES LAWSUIT AND CONSOLIDATES QUEBEC POSITION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questerre Energy Corp</span>. has executed a 
letter of intent with a senior exploration and production company to 
settle outstanding litigation and acquire all its assets in the St. 
Lawrence Lowlands, Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, president and chief executive officer of Questerre, 
commented: "On closing, we will gain operatorship of our acreage in the 
lowlands. We will be in a much better position to communicate directly 
with municipalities and address local concerns and acceptability. Our 
approach is that good relationships with local communities comes first 
and development second.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We will continue our 
step-by-step approach of working with the government and municipalities.
 This project will proceed by adequately addressing their concerns and 
making sure they participate in the benefits. We are confident that, 
with success, this project will help Quebec greatly reduce its 
hydrocarbon import problem and meet its 2030 energy policy targets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pursuant to the LOI, 
Questerre will acquire the exploration rights to 753,000 net acres in 
the lowlands, associated wells and equipment, geological and geophysical
 data, and other miscellaneous assets. Upon closing of the transaction, 
both parties will release each other from all claims related to the 
outstanding litigation. Other consideration including cash and the 
security required for the assumption of abandonment and reclamation 
liabilities (A&amp;R liabilities) is approximately $16.1-million in 
aggregate. Questerre may post a letter of credit as security for the 
A&amp;R liabilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Closing of the 
transaction is subject to the enactment by the Ministry of Energy and 
Natural Resources in Quebec of the following regulations: (i) the 
regulation respecting petroleum exploration, production and storage in a
 body of water; (ii) the regulation respecting petroleum exploration, 
production and storage on land; and (iii) the regulation respecting 
petroleum exploration, production and storage licences, and <b>pipeline</b>
 construction or use authorization. The company anticipates the final 
regulations could be published around the end of the second quarter of 
this year. Additional conditions to closing include the execution of a 
purchase and sale agreement.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a sign that we've gone too far.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consultations and regulatory processes have become disconnected from their initial purposes of informed decision-making.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Project approvals and 
permitting are regularly subjected to lengthy delays and costly 
uncertainty that have nothing to do with the environment, science, or 
our economic interests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've enfeebled our economy as a result. The case of the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b> should bring this into stark clarity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A private company wanted 
to invest $7.5 billion - more than half the federal government's annual 
infrastructure budget - in our country's energy infrastructure. It 
represented a substantial investment involving 15,000 construction jobs 
alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company, by all accounts, followed the rules. It submitted a project application at the end of 2013. The <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>
 recommended its approval in May 2016. The government accepted the 
recommendation - including 157 conditions - in November 2016. <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> spent $1 billion going through the painstaking consultation and regulatory process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet in spite of all 
this, the company ultimately decided the project wasn't viable due to 
ongoing policy and legal uncertainty. No other firm would touch it. 
Ottawa had no choice but to buy it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How did we get to a point
 where a private company that abided by the process and sought to invest
 billions of dollars in our country was precluded from doing so? How did
 we get to a point where public capital needed to replace private 
capital to finance a profitable project? This isn't a nascent industry. 
It isn't a case of market failure. We already have 840,000 km of <b>pipeline</b> operating in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most has been financed and constructed by private capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a case of government failure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, it's a failure 
by all of us. We've permitted a build up of government rules and 
processes that amounts to what conservative columnist George Will calls 
"economic enfeeblement."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trudeau government 
certainly contributed to the problem. Opportunistic critiques of the 
major project review process diminished public confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vague commitments about 
the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People raised
 the spectre of a First Nations "veto". New regulatory burdens 
exacerbated the already slow and cumbersome process. Notions of "<b>social licence</b>" were predictably used as a foil by ideological activists to stall progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is all true. But the problem is bigger than one government, one <b>pipeline</b>, or one sector. It now permeates every level of government and crosses the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One example: Condo and 
real estate developers in Toronto typically face nearly a 
year-and-a-half for approvals and spend an average of $46,570 per unit 
on compliance costs. The result is less housing supply and in turn 
higher prices at a time when people are rightly concerned about housing 
affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another example: federal,
 provincial, and local governments pledged funding for the Spadina 
subway extension in 2006 and yet the service only commenced more than 10
 years later in December 2017 following various delays and cost 
overruns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No wonder it represented the first new subway stops in decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The list could go on and on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trans Mountain episode is merely the most recent and highest profile example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It should cause us to restore common sense to government decision-making and project reviews.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's time to end the enfeeblement. We need to start building things again.</p>

increase – will be in Asia. New access to export markets other than the 
United States is critical if Canada is to stop selling our oil at huge 
discounts. It's time to keep that money here – along with the private 
sector jobs and government revenues that it creates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.C. Premier John Horgan's death-by-delay strategy was working against <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 because for a private company, time is money – their money. But it 
won't work against Ottawa. Ottawa has lots of time and lots of money – 
other people's money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals' hope is 
that the futility of further delaying tactics will be so obvious that 
the B.C. government will abandon their rope-a-dope strategy. Or if they 
don't, one or two defections and/or several recall elections will force 
Mr. Horgan's minority government into a non-confidence vote and a new 
election sooner rather than later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But beyond that, there's 
nothing positive about Tuesday's announcement. It was an 11th-hour 
government bailout of a privately funded <b>pipeline</b> project that had met all the requirements for approval. Will that inspire investor confidence going forward? Hardly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How was the $4.5-billion 
purchase price arrived at? With Mr. Trudeau – or his emissary, the poor 
Finance Minister Bill Morneau – on his knees in Houston, begging. By 
April of this year, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> 
understood that Mr. Trudeau and Canada needed the Trans Mountain 
expansion much more than they did. The Prime Minister had 
single-handedly destroyed all of Canada's other options to reach new 
export markets – first Northern Gateway, then Energy East.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All that was left was Trans Mountain. Did <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 price gouge on the purchase price? Of course. And why shouldn't they, 
given what has happened – or rather, not happened – in the past year?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The point is that it should never have reached this stage. By January of last year, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> had met every requirement of both the federal <span class="companylink">National Energy Board (NEB) </span>process and B.C.'s five conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what's been going on 
for the past 15 months? Some will point to the May, 2017, election of 
the NDP minority government in B.C. and their pledge to “use every tool 
in the toolbox" to block the Trans Mountain expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, the B.C. election 
was a proximate cause, but the deeper, formal cause has been Mr. 
Trudeau's own public rhetoric on climate change. From Paris onward, he 
has aided and abetted the antipipeline movement by repeating the 
climate-change militants' own dogmas, stigmatizing Canada's oil and gas 
industry and undermining the reputation of the NEB. All of this has 
legitimated and emboldened the very groups that are now trying to block 
the Trans Mountain expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the one positive to come out of all of this is that we won't have to listen to any more nonsense about <b>social licence</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposition that imposing carbon taxes, closing down coalfired electricity and subsidizing renewables would turn <b>pipeline</b> opponents into <b>pipeline</b> supporters has failed completely. Try to name one convert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or listen to U.S. environmentalist Bill McKibben of <span class="companylink">350.org</span> or our own climate-change wizard, David Suzuki. Both are adamant that all oil sands oil must stay in the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trudeau has been 
speaking out of both sides of his mouth since he was elected, and now it
 has caught up with him. In Paris, he paraded as the Prince of Climate 
Change. When he was in Houston, he was a champion for export pipelines. 
He wanted it both ways, but now he can't: He owns a <b>pipeline</b> and has promised to complete it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To do this, he will have 
to go to battle with the very groups that supported him in the 2015 
election – urban climate-change activists, Indigenous communities and 
maybe Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile Mr. Trudeau's 
new, erstwhile allies in this battle – Alberta, Saskatchewan, the energy
 sector and other business interests – did not support him in 2015 and, 
for the reasons discussed above, are no more likely to support him in 
2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the next election 
only 17 months away, the Liberals are in trouble and they know it. Mr. 
Trudeau is the architect of his party's demise. But the rest of us will 
have to pay for it.</p>

 Minister Justin Trudeau took the stage on Tuesday evening at The Globe 
and Mail Centre in Toronto hours after his government announced a deal 
to acquire the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b>, and was introduced as “Canada's newest oil baron."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trudeau took the joke
 in stride, responding that his grandfather owned gas stations, so 
perhaps it's appropriate his government is dropping $4.5-billion to take
 over the controversial energy project from <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Inc</span>.
 If the Prime Minister can duplicate his grandfather's track record, 
taxpayers will do just fine out of the Trans Mountain deal.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Trudeau needs to get his timing right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charles-Émile Trudeau, a 
lawyer by training, spent the 1920s acquiring gas stations around 
Montreal, then sold the chain of 30 outlets to <span class="companylink">Imperial Oil</span>
 in 1932 for $1-million - and as they say, that was when a million was 
worth something. That investment formed the base of the family's 
fortune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal Liberals 
bought Trans Mountain to fulfill their commitment to get Alberta oil to 
the British Columbia coast after its Houston-based owner threw in the 
towel on plans to triple the <b>pipeline</b>'s capacity in the face of fierce political and public resistance, especially in B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government is already trying to find a willing buyer to take Trans Mountain off its hands. Investment bank <span class="companylink">Greenhill &amp; Co</span>. has been hired to pitch the project to everyone from pension-fund bosses to private-equity investors to <b>pipeline</b> companies. But the timing is off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No private company will 
be willing to go near Trans Mountain when the fate of the project 
remains in doubt. As long as environmentalists and other opponents 
believe they can stop the <b>pipeline</b>, its owner will be a political target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No chief executive wants to associate the corporate brand with scenes of <b>pipeline</b> protesters being led away in handcuffs, or deal with endless court challenges from B.C.'s NDP government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So for now, the <b>pipeline</b> can't be flipped. The challenge for Ottawa - and Bay Street - is figuring out how much of the longpromised <b>pipeline</b>
 expansion must be built before the perceived risks begin to drop away 
and buyers step up with attractive offers. Opinions on this are all over
 the map.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The head of one 
investment bank, speaking anonymously because his firm desperately wants
 to work for a future buyer, told me the Liberals will not get full 
value for Trans Mountain until the project is 100-per-cent done, with 
oil flowing into tankers in Vancouver harbour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His second-in-command, in
 the same conversation, insisted there would be a lineup of buyers at 
30-per-cent complete. This banker said heavyweight U.S. investors such 
as <span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway Inc</span>., which already has significant stakes in Canadian utilities, and <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> would be potential bidders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bankers are also working on plans to help Trans Mountain win an elusive <b>social licence</b> by selling the project to a consortium of public sector pension plans with solid environmental credentials, including the <span class="companylink">British Columbia Investment Management Corp</span>. It's worth noting that the country's biggest fund, the <span class="companylink">Canada Pension Plan Investment Board</span>, said on Tuesday that it is “not actively assessing an investment in the extension opportunity."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That language is telling. The message from CPPIB is: We're not interested now, but call us when the noise dies down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bright minds on Bay Street are also working on solutions to the problems that drove away <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>. If First Nations groups are raising concerns about the <b>pipeline</b>, bring them in as co-owners, as <span class="companylink">Suncor Energy Inc</span>.
 did by partnering with the Fort McKay and Mikisew Cree First Nations on
 a recent $500million investment in an Alberta oil storage facility. 
Canadian banks might be able to provide the financing to make those 
investments possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Infrastructure assets 
such as pipelines, and the dependable cash they kick off, are currently 
hot investments. If Mr. Trudeau can do as his grandfather did and build a
 business that supplies energy to customers who need ever-increasing 
amounts of fuel, Trans Mountain will have no shortage of buyers. But the
 government needs to reduce the risks before those investors emerge.</p>

 -- MONTREAL - To understand the counterintuitive political calculus 
behind Justin Trudeau's controversial decision to buy the Trans Mountain
 <b>pipeline</b>, one has to go back to the fundamental equation that 
has governed this prime minister's energy and climate change policies 
since his days in opposition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That Trudeau had no choice but to take over the <b>pipeline</b>
 if he wanted to ensure that the plan for its expansion did not die on 
the drawing board is not in question. By the time Finance Minister Bill 
Morneau announced the federal decision Tuesday, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> - the <b>pipeline</b>'s parent company - was about to pull the plug on the project.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But
 the real question is why would the Liberal government be willing to put
 an open-ended amount of political and financial capital on the line to 
keep it alive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If one connects the dots 
between most major policies that past governments have deemed to be in 
the national interest, one almost always finds they conveniently 
intersected with a ruling party's election prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Stephen Harper's decision to bail out the auto industry in 2009 was not 
unrelated to the fact that his path to a coveted majority government ran
 through Ontario. His conversion to deficit financing at the time of the
 global economic crisis was a deathbed one, at least in part dictated by
 the need to survive confidence votes in the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by that measure, Trudeau's Trans Mountain move is an outlier. The electoral math does not add up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the face of it, the 
prime minister has at best shored up half a dozen Liberal seats in the 
Prairies at the cost of potentially putting in play at least triple that
 number across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along the way, Trudeau 
has put himself on a collision course with many Indigenous 
constituencies, and he has destroyed his international reputation as a 
climate change-crusader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the stakes, the prime minister's <b>pipeline</b>
 gamble has even been compared to Brian Mulroney's decision to roll the 
dice in his relentless quest for constitutional reconciliation with 
Quebec in the early 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mulroney had a 
compelling incentive to stick with the constitutional file to the bitter
 end. After the Meech Lake accord failed, he could not have let it go 
without risking his governing majority as the result of defections to 
the nascent Bloc Québécois and without fuelling support for Quebec 
secession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is an economic case to be made for ensuring the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b>
 is completed. Of the projects designed to link the Alberta oilfields to
 tidewater that were on the drawing board when Trudeau became prime 
minister, it is the only one that is still actively pursued. Until the 
last B.C. election, it was also considered the most likely to get to 
completion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Trans Mountain 
expansion has also become as politically indispensable to Trudeau's 
agenda - at least in the mind of its Liberal overseers - as it may be to
 Canada's oil industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was always meant to be
 the poster project for the federal contention that it is possible to 
balance Canada's energy ambitions with a more aggressive approach to 
mitigating climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Trudeau came to 
power, the emphasis has been the part of the equation that involves 
putting a price on carbon pollution as a necessary step to earn a social
 license for a <b>pipeline</b> projects such as Trans Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Liberal government believes the flipside of the equation - that a <b>social licence</b> for a carbon tax cannot be sustained if it is earned on the back of Alberta's energy industry - to be just as essential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allowing the Trans 
Mountain expansion to die this week would have cost Trudeau the support 
of Alberta's NDP government for his national climate change framework. 
Back in March, Premier Rachel Notley tied meeting Ottawa's carbon tax 
targets to the future of the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking to next year's 
federal election, the demise of the Trans Mountain expansion would have 
meant giving opponents of Trudeau's carbon pricing strategy - starting 
with the federal Conservatives - a prime exhibit in their prosecution of
 the havoc they argue his policy will wreak on the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As so it is that while 
Trudeau is widely portrayed as having picked the polluters' side in the 
climate-change debate, the Liberals will argue that they have done what 
they needed to do to continue to advance a pro-environment agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only time will tell 
whether this government has trapped itself in an intricate web of 
twisted logic. If so, as of this week's Trans Mountain announcement 
Trudeau is unlikely to untangle himself from that web in time for next 
year's election.</p>

 is yet further evidence of its commitment to a project it has 
repeatedly described as in the national interest. Instead, this decision
 shows the total bankruptcy of the government's approach to pipelines; 
that policy's failure is now so total that the government is signalling 
it accepts that no private investor can be expected to bear the risks 
associated with <b>pipeline</b> construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finance Minister Bill 
Morneau's "don't worry, be happy" approach relies on saying there are 
plenty of investors who will be prepared to take the <b>pipeline</b> off
 Ottawa's hands once it is built. But the last four words of the 
previous sentence tell the entire story. The construction phase is the 
one that carries the highest vulnerability and danger of failure. Once 
in the ground and operating, the <b>pipeline</b>'s risks, while far from zero, are acceptable to the private sector.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let us not lose sight, however, of the fact that, according to the Canadian Encyclopedia, there are 840,000 kilometres of <b>pipeline</b>
 operating in Canada today. Pretty much all of this hugely impressive 
network has been constructed using private capital that was effortlessly
 deployed by investors who saw in Canada a country with an intelligently
 designed and applied regulatory framework and an unshakeable commitment
 to the rule of law. That reputation now lies in tatters and we now 
learn that only the government, using captive taxpayers as bankers, can 
complete this project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor is the nationalization of Trans Mountain the only evidence of the failure of this government's <b>pipeline</b>
 policy. Cast your mind back to the moment the Trudeau government 
arrived in office. Leaving aside Keystone XL, there were three major <b>pipeline</b>
 proposals to bring Canadian oil to tidewater: Trans Mountain, Northern 
Gateway and Energy East. The Liberals had courted the environmental vote
 with promises that the permission of affected communities would be 
sought and obtained (i.e. "<b>social licence</b>") for such projects. In
 exchange for that local acquiescence, the Liberals were willing to 
offer a panoply of measures designed to reassure Canadians that 
pipelines met the highest standards. New regulatory burdens and 
standards, carbon taxes and, in collaboration with Alberta, emissions 
caps for the oilsands were all enacted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of this new burden 
was used to kill one of the three projects, Enbridge's Northern Gateway,
 thanks to offshore tanker bans and forbidding the routing of any <b>pipeline</b>
 through the so-called Great Bear Rainforest. The fact that Enbridge had
 spent over $1 billion on its proposal, had been granted permission 
under the law to proceed and was prepared to spend billions more of 
private investors' money, were not to be allowed to interfere with the 
government's virtue signalling. One down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next came the withdrawal of <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> <b>Pipeline</b>'s
 Energy East project. The government at the time liked to put about the 
fiction that this was some kind of commercial decision by the company 
whereas the innocent government stood ready to support the project if it
 proceeded. Independent observers, however, are virtually unanimous in 
seeing the increased regulatory burden and political uncertainty 
(especially in Quebec) as having killed the project. Far from promising 
nationalization, the government heaved a sigh of relief. Two down, again
 dragging many hundreds of millions in private investors' capital with 
it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That leaves Trans 
Mountain, what former federal cabinet minister Brian Tobin might have 
referred to as the one last, lonely, unattractive, little <b>pipeline</b>
 clinging by its fingernails. Ottawa hopes nationalization of the 
project will send a signal of a resolute government determined to see 
this through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the contrary, though, 
this decision will be seen by foreign investors as an admission of 
weakness, not a sign of strength. Ottawa is essentially saying that such
 infrastructure, previously built by private capital under known rules 
and under the protection of the law, is now being built in an atmosphere
 in Canada that is so hostile and unwelcoming that it no longer expects 
private investors to shoulder the risk. Considering that one half of all
 business investment intentions in Canada derive from the 
capital-intensive natural resource sector, the negative fallout is 
potentially huge for future living standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not lost on those 
who build and invest in pipelines that on the day the decision was 
announced to buy Trans Mountain, the media were full of reports that 
Green Party Leader Elizabeth May was proudly paying a $1,500 fine for 
criminal contempt for having defied a court order not to obstruct the 
project's progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Count on hundreds, if not
 thousands more, following in her footsteps along the Trans Mountain 
route, assuming that legal challenges by B.C. and First Nations can be 
overcome. The Liberals are about to reap the <b>social licence</b> whirlwind whose seeds they helped to sow.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally,
 we know how the Liberals will try to salvage our last opportunity to 
ship oil overseas, an overriding problem of their own making. At a price
 of $4.5 billion, the <span class="companylink">government of Canada</span> will purchase the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b> (TMX) from <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada</span>
 (whose market capitalization interestingly is $1.75 billion) and 
indemnify the cost of construction. Then it hopes to find a 
private-sector buyer in the short or medium term. A desperate buyer will
 become a desperate seller. Good luck!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finance Minister Bill 
Morneau dodged questions about the total hit to taxpayers. The project's
 capital cost is still officially $7.4 billion, but rumours are 
circulating that expenses could mount to $11 billion. So the total 
federal investment, with a potential $2-billion Alberta participation, 
will be well over $11 billion, in addition to overruns and environmental
 risk.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial indemnification, which most Canadians opposed, was not enough to entice <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 to stay in the game because Trudeau could not guarantee a definitive 
legal result, a co-operative B.C. government or social peace. Therefore,
 he could not preclude lengthy delays. Nor could he prevent a 
reputational hit to the company when Aboriginal elders and environmental
 activists carry signs (before soldiers cart them off to jail) decrying 
how <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> is threatening the 
B.C. coast. Capital is scarce and the company has investment 
alternatives that do not pose comparable risks. Now Trudeau must summon 
the fortitude to confront all those challenges and enforce the rule of 
law, or construction will be blocked indefinitely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government had to buy
 TMX because the project is crucial to Canada's economic prospects and 
national unity. Otherwise, our proven oil reserves, the third-largest in
 the world, would be effectively landlocked. However, Trudeau devoted 
the previous two-and-a-half years crowing about his green bonafides here
 and around the world. It has to be excruciating for him to nationalize a
 <b>pipeline</b> transporting diluted bitumen from the oilsands across 
British Columbia to Vancouver where workers will be confronted by irate 
protesters decrying his stunning betrayal. If it does not leave his 
environmental legacy in tatters it will, at the minimum, tarnish it 
irrevocably. Also, nationalization clearly signals that Canada was 
unable to retain or attract private-sector capital for a major resource 
project. Public money may address Trans Mountain, but resource 
development generally is in considerable doubt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the finance minister
 hightailed it down to Houston to meet Richard Kinder, his bargaining 
power was exceptionally weak. Kinder, doubtless frustrated by roadblocks
 and $1 billion in sunk cost, knew Morneau had run out of options, since
 his government burned the other two possibilities - Northern Gateway 
with a direct rejection and Energy East with regulatory impediments. 
Furthermore, the new Impact Assessment Act made it untenable for anyone 
to propose a major <b>pipeline</b>. Not surprisingly, Canada is viewed around the globe as a resource-rich country that literally cannot deliver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furthermore, this 
decision does not eliminate the possibility the project becomes bogged 
down in court challenges or civil disobedience, with no end in sight. 
Also, there are no guarantees private investors will show up in the 
intermediate term, if ever. In spite of initial support, a skeptical 
public may come to consider open-ended risk to be a very bad deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morneau has suggested our pensions funds, including the <span class="companylink">Canada Pension Plan Investment Board</span>,
 might be interested in investing in the project. The politicization of 
our national pension fund would undermine public confidence in the 
safety of our savings. Instead, pension fund managers will weigh TMX 
against alternative opportunities with less uncertainty, or politically 
risky projects with considerably higher returns. The Feds will have to 
assure a healthy profit before a pension fund or private sector investor
 commits billions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal legislation will 
not help. Senate Bill S-245 declared TMX a work "for the general 
advantage of Canada." While the House could pass that Bill, our 
legislators know it will not substantively add to federal jurisdiction, 
so it is pure showboating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this is a colossal 
political failure, which the prime minister will attempt to spin into an
 accomplishment. Even those who support the <b>pipeline</b> are worried 
about public ownership, government playing favourites, the open-ended 
cost to taxpayers and regulatory impediments that mean death by delay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fence sitting, obstruction and vacuous sloganeering have come to naught for the prime minister who pretended he could achieve a <b>social licence</b>
 by promoting both environmental protection and resource development. 
Consensus was always a naïve delusion. Now the government will have to 
muscle it through over entrenched opposition. It did not have to come to
 this, but when Trudeau promised to reconcile the irreconcilable, 
something had to give. The give is that taxpayers just bought a <b>pipeline</b> no one else wanted.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The original route is 65 years old</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's 1150 km long.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First opened in 1953, the <b>pipeline</b> has run pretty well over its history, though it's averaged just over a leak a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heck, there was one on Sunday in Kamloops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What does your $4.5 billion get you</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, now you get the <b>pipeline</b>. You get the attached pumping stations, terminals and storage tanks. You got some pretty fancy signage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh and you get, by proxy,
 a whole swath of protesters. They're free, though. Of course, you may 
have to pay a bunch of cops to keep them away from your new employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then again, as you're 
hoping, maybe you'll find a private buyer for the whole thing by August.
 Just get that construction rolling!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Really? I can find a buyer?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business analysts point out that a <b>pipeline</b> is a pretty safe asset: a predictable stream of revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's oil going in at 
one end and coming out at the other, ready to be sold. You get paid for 
the transport. Pretty straightforward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so, you figure someone will want to pay for that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, you are still are going to have spend another $7 billion - at least</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You do have to build the new <b>pipeline</b>, which will run along the old right of way. This construction cost is on top of the $4.5 billion you just spent. <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> says they've already spent $1 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They figure to finish the expansion project will cost at least another $7 billion and maybe more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at the end of the day, you'll have tripled the capacity of the old pipe. Smooth business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just how much is $4.5 billion?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, the population of 
Canada at the last census was 36.29 million people. That works out to 
each of us owning about $125 worth of the <b>pipeline</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's really not too much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do you need permission from communities?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or just the courts?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the 2015 federal 
election Justin Trudeau and the Liberals insisted: "While governments 
grant permits for resource development, only communities can grant 
permission."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau even declared that while standing on the shore of English Bay. <b>Social licence</b> is the now-well-known term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One year later, in 
September 2016, the Trudeau government government tabled a document in 
the House of Commons that made no mention of the need for communities to
 provide permission. A statement from Resource Minister Jim Carr's 
office now defined <b>social licence</b> as "ensuring public confidence in the decision-making for major resource projects."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So? Which is it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's this about a court battle?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The B.C. government has 
launched a reference case at the B.C. Court of Appeal over whether the 
province has jurisdiction under the Constitution Act to regulate the 
transport of oil through its territory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A B.C. win would be very bad news for the <b>pipeline</b> and especially for prospects of a future sale to private investors.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, will it even be 
possible, given this precedent, to build any future inter-provincial

earth? This despite Obama's hypocritical veto of the Keystone XL <b>pipeline</b> to move Alberta's oil to the U.S. Gulf Coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe, now that U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Donald Trump has lifted that veto, Trudeau will buy it with our money, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why has our self-described "green" PM, who used to babble about "phasing out" the oilsands, ended up buying a <b>pipeline</b>
 to ship oilsands oil to British Columbia and the world? Because once he

losing $15 billion annually having to sell almost all of our oil to the 
U.S. at a huge discount, since we have no way to get it to global 
markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau's purchase of the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b> project delighted Alberta NDP Premier Rachel Notley, who will be contributing $2 billion to the <b>pipeline</b>'s costs, if needed, from Albertans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What all this shows is 
the abject failure of Trudeau's and Notley's superficial and absurd 
belief that imposing a national carbon price on Canadians would give 
them the "<b>social licence</b>" to build the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b>, with the blessings of B.C.'s anti-oil government, Indigenous objectors and radical environmentalists.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On his way into the cabinet meeting Tuesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was tight-lipped about the risks of his <b>pipeline</b> plan to taxpayers or the environment, saying only that “we're going to get that <b>pipeline</b> built.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau's options 
included buying a partial equity stake as Alberta's provincial NDP 
government also offered to do, taking over the project outright to build
 it then sell it to other investors, or buying it from <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> and flipping it quickly to other interested investors to build it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau and Morneau had already offered to “indemnify” or insure <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>, a company with headquarters in Houston, against unexpected costs due to delays caused by the B.C. government's litigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.C. Premier John Horgan, whose minority government is propped up by the Green Party, promised to use all tools to stop the <b>pipeline</b> expansion or dramatically reduce the amount of heavy crude it would send to Vancouver's coastal waters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> told Ottawa publicly two 
weeks ago that it “appreciated” Morneau's offer to cover its losses, but
 the two sides were not “in alignment.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, it was clearly not enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau believes the only
 way to ensure that construction gets underway immediately and the 
project's 2020 completion deadline is met was for Ottawa to step in now 
because the federal government is best placed to confront the B.C. 
government's court challenge that seeks to assert provincial 
jurisdiction to block it in the name of coastal water protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In spite of opposition by some Indigenous groups and environmentalists in B.C., Trudeau has declared the <b>pipeline</b>
 expansion a vital strategic interest for the country — one that will 
create tens of thousands of jobs in B.C. and Alberta, and ensure 
Alberta's oil sands exports are no longer sold at a discount mainly to 
U.S. refineries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau pegged that as a $15-billion annual hit to the Canadian economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morneau insists the twinning of the <b>pipeline</b>
 even in face of opposition by B.C.'s NDP government is a “commercially 
viable” project, and that there are “plenty” of other investors 
interested in it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But just as important to Trudeau's government is the fact a guarantee of the <b>pipeline</b>'s expansion is the key to the Alberta government's participation in his climate change plans for a national carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau's Environment 
Minister Catherine McKenna has linked the two as well, but on Tuesday 
morning she said nothing to reporters as she walked straight-faced into 
cabinet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The irony of Trudeau — who said <b>pipeline</b> projects need “<b>social licence</b>” to proceed and has championed consultation with Indigenous people— buying an oil <b>pipeline</b>
 in the name of the global fight against greenhouse gases, is just as 
eyebrow-raising as former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper's 
bailout of two auto giants during the 2009 global financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It raises the political stakes for Trudeau as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morneau says the federal 
government has clear jurisdiction over the interprovincial movement of 
Canada's natural resources, and it would have been impossible for a 
private sector company to end a dispute that is between two governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some critics believe, 
however, that the project is unlikely to be the saviour for Canadian 
exports, and that oil is still just as likely to be shipped to U.S. west
 coast refineries and from there sold to Asia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the federal NDP opened a new front in its own opposition to the project by painting <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 as a Canadian corporate tax dodger, telling the Commons the company has
 declared net income for the past three years of more than $340 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parliamentary leader Guy 
Caron said: “Do you know how many taxes were paid? $1.1 million in three
 years. Can the Prime Minister explain why it would be in the national 
interest to give a blank check — for how much? $5 billion? $1 billion? —
 to a company like <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> that finds a way, and has an interest in not paying its fair share of taxes?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP made the charge in the Commons Monday where its MPs statements are protected from the application of libel laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau offered no direct
 answer about the company's tax obligations to Canada but defended his 
government's approach, and chastised the NDP for trying to block it “at 
any price.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is in the national interest to go ahead with it and that's why the <b>pipeline</b> will be built,” said Trudeau.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One
 of the burdens of being prime minister is that it affords the occupant 
of the office scant room to hide. Not that Justin Trudeau isn't trying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prime minister 
returned from his trip to New York and Boston with sweet Fanny Adams on 
borders or trade, i.e. the two major irritants in Canada's relationship 
with The Massive Irritant fronting the Gazebo of CrazyT formerly known 
as the presidency.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that you'd know Canada was much bothered - on either front - by the current state of affairs. Even with an important <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>
 deadline slipping by and the unofficial border-crossing season about to
 open, the official trip summary issued by Trudeau's office peddled only
 soft euphemisms about the Canada-U.S. "partnership" and its importance 
to "good, middle-class jobs," while (insert favoured euphemism for 
"illegal" here) border crossings weren't mentioned at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, we were reminded of the prime minister's cloying address to <span class="companylink">NYU</span>
 graduates, where Trudeau - from the comfort of his bubble - told an 
audience of admirers to get out of theirs, and a laundry list of 
meetings with business leaders whose welcomed investments in Canada will
 do little to mask the trauma should Trump decide to spite Canada and 
spike <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while Trudeau did 
talk trade with an audience of the converted at the Economic Club of New
 York, he wasn't playing offence and didn't offer a tactical 
intervention; his comments were mostly to cheer on the people who were 
doing the real work in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've worked with (the 
Americans) on a whole bunch of issues, including this morning in 
Washington where we have some of our top folks continuing the 
conversations," Trudeau told the audience. "I'm feeling positive about 
this, but it won't be done until it's done and people are working very, 
very hard on it right now," he added. To pick up on a theme the Liberals
 are currently pushing: It wasn't an answer Stephen Harper would have 
given.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And when Trudeau did 
eventually careen into specifics by saying Mexico had made proposals 
that will "go a long way towards reducing the trade deficit the U.S. has
 with Mexico and indeed even bringing back some auto jobs from Mexico to
 the United States," he was quickly rebuked on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>
 by Mexico's economy minister, who replied: "a clarification is 
necessary: any renegotiated Nafta that implies losses of existing 
Mexican jobs is unacceptable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fine, Trudeau isn't the 
details guy. But when partisans are trying to paint a picture of Trudeau
 as a man with "the political depth of a finger bowl," it would surely 
help the prime minister to take a deep dive on some of the complicated 
issues currently facing his government, whether it be <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>, illegal border crossings or the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, on all of these files Trudeau is taking a back seat to his ministers, with Chrystia Freeland fronting efforts to get <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> over the line, Bill Morneau playing <b>pipeline</b>
 poker and Ahmed Hussen trying to stem the flow of Nigerians crossing 
the 49th parallel. Given that failure on any of these fronts would be 
injurious to Liberal reelection prospects, it's a high-risk approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The charitable 
interpretation is that Trudeau trusts his team to get the job done. The 
PMO will also claim that each office is working in tandem with the 
Centre. But the longer Trudeau stays in the shadows as issues come to a 
boil, the more people might draw another conclusion: that the prime 
minister just doesn't have anything of substance to offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's also the question
 of brand. Even if stopping the flow over the Canada-U.S. border could 
be done without a willing partner in the U.S. (a ha-yuuge 'if'), doing 
so would run counter to Trudeau's public promise to welcome all. Trudeau
 can't be hard-ass on immigration for the same reason Stephen Harper 
couldn't be a candy-ass on the same question: the base would revolt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But last year saw upwards
 of 20,000 dodgy crossings, with experts predicting more this summer as 
the Trump administration continues to crack down on various communities 
who have overstayed their welcome. What Trudeau will eventually find out
 is what Harper knew to his core: that Canada's vaunted support for 
immigration is heavily predicated on its being done properly and fairly,
 which all can agree isn't an accurate description of what's currently 
happening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau is in a similar bind on pipelines, with his enviro-<b>social licence</b>-Indigenous-consultation image crashing hard into the economic necessity of our oil reaching tidewater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This leaves <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>
 as the one bona-fide opportunity for Trudeau to demonstrate some 
mettle. So, enough of the cheerleading prime minister, it's time to come
 out from behind your ministry and own a file. Andrew MacDougall is a 
Londonbased communications consultant and ex-director of communications 
to former prime minister Stephen Harper.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in the early 1980s, I did volunteer work for Nick Taylor. At the time, he was leader of the <span class="companylink">Alberta Liberal Party</span>. (That's right, in a previous life I was a Liberal. Before I grew up.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nick was a great guy to 
work for and to drive around the province with. An oilfield geologist by
 training, he was strongly opposed to Pierre Trudeau's National Energy 
Program (NEP).</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But
 the federal wing of his own party had created the NEP. They loved it 
and weren't about to change it, not even to help Nick get elected 
provincially. His protestations fell on deaf ears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And since Nick could do 
nothing to convince his own national party to amend its hated plan 
(which sought to steal control of the energy sector and its revenues 
from Alberta), Alberta voters didn't see much point in electing Nick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taylor later won election
 to the Alberta Legislature, but only after the Mulroney Tories had been
 elected and had begun to dismantle the NEP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was reminded of Nick, 
and his lead-footed driving of his Mercedes convertible, on Thursday 
when federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh announced he was now fully opposed
 to the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Singh has made a Nick Taylor out of his fellow New Democrat, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We shouldn't be surprised by Singh's stance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal NDP as a whole have been against every <b>pipeline</b> for years. And ever since he was elected national party leader last fall, Singh has leaned against Trans Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the eve of the NDP's 
last national convention this past February in Ottawa, Singh said Trans 
Mountain met none of his three conditions for approval: It didn't honour
 the principles of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples. It failed to meet climate-change goals. And it 
didn't (in his mind) create enough local economic opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, Singh's statement on Wednesday that he is now completely opposed to the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> <b>pipeline</b>
 is really just a variation on a theme. It's as if in February he said 
he was really opposed and now he is really, really opposed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if Rachel Notley 
cannot even get the national leader of her own party to back Trans 
Mountain, she's kind of in the position of my old pal Nick. What's the 
point of voting for her? And she can't get her fellow New Democrat 
Premier John Horgan to change his mind. And she can't get her buddy 
Justin Trudeau to actually do anything concrete to get the <b>pipeline</b> built, no matter how much she's cozied up to him politically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, again, what's the point? Her "<b>social licence</b>"
 theory hasn't worked. Her Climate Leadership Plan, with its carbon tax 
and coal plant closures has failed to change minds or policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Notley was first 
elected back in 2015, she made a big deal about blaming the lack of 
pipelines on the federal Harper Tories and the long-governing provincial
 Tories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their confrontational approach, she scoffed, had failed to get us a <b>pipeline</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Justin Trudeau levelled similar accusations in Ottawa. If only the 
Tories, federally and provincially, had demonstrated more concern for 
climate change and tried to woo the "green" bees with environmental 
honey rather than economic vinegar, Alberta would already have the 
energy infrastructure it needed, according to Trudeau and Notley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, we've now had three years of the Trudeau-Notley approach, and if the Trans Mountain project survives past <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s deadline next week, it will not be because of some expensive, new, green-friendly strategy by the P.M. or our premier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will be because of the oldest tactic in the book: throwing gobs of taxpayers'dollars at the problem to make it go away.</p>

 <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b> expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short, he now says he is against it because of the Liberal government's plan to financially back the <b>pipeline</b>, "to benefit private shareholders of a corporation in Texas."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, Mr. Singh, nobody in Alberta or B.C. would benefit from the <b>pipeline</b> during construction or following completion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And like the NDP has ever worried about taxpayers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previously, the seatless leader of the federal NDP had called for a further environmental review of the <b>pipeline</b> - never mind the thing has already been studied to death and approved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He appears to have 
changed his position following a painful personal journey, saying, "This
 was a very difficult decision for me. It wasn't something I took 
lightly but leaders have to make tough decisions."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the fact there
 will soon be a seat opening up in NDP-friendly Burnaby, which also 
happens to be ground zero for Trans Mountain opposition, had absolutely 
nothing to do with his decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, despite thumbing 
his nose at Alberta, he couldn't pass up the chance to praise Premier 
Rachel Notley for her government's carbon tax, calling it the "best 
climate change plan in the country."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So again, <b>social licence</b> fails but the left gratefully accepts the punitive tax on Albertans. Bravo, to all concerned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He went even further in his praise of Notley, despite some cutting comments of hers towards his take on Trans Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we want to attain our climate goals, we need a premier like Premier Notley," said Singh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And taxpaying fools like 
Albertans, he forgot to add, who will cough up the onerous carbon tax 
with no benefit from so-called allies of Confederation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, we have to hand it to the premier for giving it back to her federal party brother.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The private shareholders
 that he's describing happen to be part of a company that will 
contribute, I don't know, roughly $15 billion to the Canadian economy 
and will contribute to and support over a quarter million jobs in the 
country of Canada," she said on CBC.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley wanted reporters 
to know Tuesday why she had chosen not to attend the western 
premiers'conference in Yellowknife this week. She said she was staying 
close to her office at the legislature so she could work on keeping 
Trans Mountain alive.</p>

 builders Kinder Morgan have said if there is no deal on the line by 
next week, they will abandon the project. (That would make Trans 
Mountain the third <b>pipeline</b> abandoned by energy companies since the provincial NDP and federal Liberals came to office in 2015.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we want to have pharmacare, Notley told reporters, we need the <b>pipeline</b> and the tax revenues it will generate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we want to make sure that every Canadian can get the medications they need, we need to be able to pay for it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">lgunter@postmedia.com 
Really!? Seriously!? Notley's push for Trans Mountain since last 
November has really just been about expanding the welfare state? We need
 the <b>pipeline</b> so we can make government even bigger? It used to be "<b>social licence</b>"
 - the theory that if Alberta made itself an environmental leader with 
high carbon taxes and stifling eco regulations, "green" politicians and 
eco-activists would welcome our pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Notley's sales pitch is "give us the <b>pipeline</b> so we can expand the social safety net."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new approach will be no more successful than the last one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Greens" are detached 
from reality. They believe a magical transformation of our economy from 
fossil fuels to no-carbon alternatives will occur as with the wave of a 
wand. Seamless, swift, unnoticed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They refuse to see the 
connections between jobs and pipelines, between prosperity and oil. They
 don't believe the energy sector is needed to help keep us all employed,
 so why would they worry that elaborate new social programs are 
impossible without Trans Mountain? In their world, the non-polluting 
fairy-dust economy will provide all the money we need to live happily 
ever after.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(I'm not even sure I want Trans Mountain if all the proceeds are to be used for is an expansion of the suffocating nanny state.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Isn't the Alberta 
government (and Ottawa for that matter) spending enough money already? 
Since they came to office just three years ago, the NDP have ramped up 
spending from $49 billion to $56 billion. That's nearly 15 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We don't have a revenue problem, Alberta has a spending problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pharmacare could cost around $2 billion a year for comprehensive coverage in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But isn't it a little 
premature for Notley to be tying Trans Mountain to free prescriptions 
when her government is racking up deficits at the rate of about $10 
billion a year? Shouldn't they dig themselves out of debt before they 
start thinking of even more, elaborate, expensive social programs? And 
consider this: in a study released Thursday, <span class="companylink">Vancouver's Fraser Institute</span>
 estimates that by 2021, the cost of the interest on the NDP's debt will
 be about $655 per Albertan, annually. (It was $176 per person in 2015.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of even the most
 expensive pharmacare plan would be about $470 per Albertan, meaning it 
is excess borrowing that is squeezing out pharmacare, not lack of tax 
revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the NDP were even 
remotely better money managers, they would be able to afford pharmacare 
with the revenues they have now. Then Trans Mountain revenues could be 
used to restore the Alberta Advantage - to reduce taxes and get out of 
the way of job-creating investment.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just to recap: In the quest to ship Alberta crude to overseas markets, the federal Liberals are down to one <b>pipeline</b>, having killed off Northern Gateway and allowed Energy East to die.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That <b>pipeline</b>, the
 Trans Mountain expansion, is now itself in considerable doubt, in part 
owing to the Liberals'previous encouragement (previous, that is, to 
coming to power) of its most determined opponents: by their 
delegitimization of the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>, which approved it; by the prime minister's apparent endorsement of the extra-legal doctrine of "<b>social licence</b>;"
 and by his apparent endorsement of another position found nowhere in 
law: that First Nations have a right, not just to be consulted, but to 
approve or disapprove of projects on lands to which they claim title.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It gets worse. With just one <b>pipeline</b>
 left to build, and having done their best to ensure it won't be built, 
the Liberals - having since declared (since, that is, coming to power) 
that in fact it will be built - are now down to one company to build it.
 One, or maybe none.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company that was going to build it, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>,
 last month said it will not proceed without some assurance that it can 
proceed - that it will not be subject to such delays, owing to the 
obstructionist tactics of the NDP government of British Columbia, as to 
make the whole thing uneconomic. It must have such assurance, the 
company says, by May 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not clear the Liberals can offer <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 the kind of assurance it needs - not by May 31, at any rate. The B.C. 
government has since referred a series of questions to the province's 
Court of Appeal asking whether it has authority to block the shipment of
 bitumen through the province; even if it is ultimately rebuffed, that 
is not going to happen before May 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals, meanwhile, 
have promised legislation clarifying and affirming federal jurisdiction 
over interprovincial pipelines, so as to deprive the courts of any 
wiggle room for the usual Solomonic finding of shared jurisdiction 
("co-operative federalism" and all that). The legislation, however, has 
yet to be produced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With just four sitting days left in the month, it is equally unlikely to be passed in time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the best the Liberals can offer <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 is a series of promises of what will happen after May 31: we'll pass 
the legislation, we'll win in court, and we'll compensate you for any 
delays. The finance minister this week described this as 
"indemnification" - insurance, basically - against the costs of B.C.'s 
political gamesmanship. How much this might amount to he did not say, 
with good reason: he can't. It's a matter to be negotiated with <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is that there
 is an imbalance in the two sides'negotiating positions. Notwithstanding
 the billion dollars it has sunk into the project to date, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 can walk away from it at any time, and will if it feels the capital 
required to complete the project could be more profitably deployed 
elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whereas the Liberals cannot walk away: they've committed, publicly and unequivocally, to the proposition that "the <b>pipeline</b> will be built."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's all very well for the finance minister to note the government might not have to pay out on <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s
 "insurance" policy - why, they might even charge the company a premium 
for it - but he's hardly in a position to dictate terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So to give themselves 
some bargaining leverage, the Liberals have been talking up all the 
other private companies they have lined up to take over the project, 
should they fail to come to terms with <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>. Companies like ... er, um, ah...... The reality is that if <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 is unwilling to complete the project, even with a federal backstop, it 
is unlikely any other private company would prove more willing. Not only
 would it face all of the same obstacles <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 faces - in addition to the B.C. government's opposition, there is a 
separate lawsuit by several First Nations, plus the mounting threat of 
physical force by protesters on site - but it could not be certain the <span class="companylink">NEB</span>'s approval of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s application would apply to it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So increasingly the focus
 of speculation is on other, "non-private" sources of capital. And here 
is where things start to get a little alarming. If overt nationalization
 is unlikely, that does not mean it could not happen by other means.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The finance minister was 
quoted telling Reuters this week of the many "very sophisticated 
Canadian pension funds and institutional investors" with the expertise 
to take on the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Again, he offered no names for the record, but it is significant that the first place the reporter went for comment was the <span class="companylink">Canada Pension Plan Investment Board</span>, an agency of government with fiduciary responsibility for the pensions of millions of retirees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CPPIB is free to 
invest in any project around the world. Is this really the sort of thing
 it wants to get mixed up in, a hugely contentious project backed by one
 of its government sponsors and opposed by another? Another possibility 
being floated is the nascent federal Infrastructure Bank. You'll recall 
the point of the bank was to be at arm's-length from political 
interference, and thus able to raise funds from private investors on 
strictly commercial terms. Yet hardly has it begun operations and the 
first thing it's supposed to finance is a <b>pipeline</b> the government has staked its life on? Maybe it will never come to that. Maybe the Liberals will find a way to keep <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> on board. But they are running out of options and they are running out of time.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If
 we don't convince the world that we have our act together, as a 
country, on the environment, we will find it harder and harder to get 
our resources to world markets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was Justin Trudeau, 
during a 2013 speech in Calgary. Well, here in 2018, how together is 
"our" act on the environment? Currently B.C. and Alberta are staring out
 at each other over the ramparts on global warming. The Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b>
 is the causus belli, but global warming, i.e., what is really meant by 
"the environment" these days, is what the strife in Canada is, and has 
been for quite a while, all about.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever
 it does for the Earth, global warming raises the temperature in 
politics. Take the ardent catastrophist Naomi Klein for instance. Her 
view of it is as the hell mouth to "injustice, racism, intolerance and 
wars," a tidy quartet. On Canada's much abjured <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> <b>pipeline</b>,
 Klein is only a little less fretful. She speaks of that, among other 
drear indictments, as having the potential to "cook the planet." A sense
 of proportion is clearly not a dominant virtue when global warming is 
your cause. Her views are the views of the movement. She is a leading 
antagonist in the global warming war.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that war the Canadian 
oilsands has been the main front for over a decade. It has been the 
object of the world's environmentalists'most sustained crusade. It will 
not take a Jeopardy sage to guess which national government has been 
most avidly the champion of the cause. The Trudeau government, with its 
acute ambition to be seen as the whitest of the white knights in the 
combat against the Great Warming to come, its patent yearning to be seen
 as a, or the, major player in the great cause, has made the fight 
against what it calls climate change its most public and urgent 
endeavour. Global warming has, for all intents, replaced peacekeeping as
 Canada's bid for global stature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In doing so, it has 
recklessly enriched the atmosphere in which the campaigns against 
Canadian oil are conducted, and equally - until very recent days - has 
been passive to the point of prostration to all the propaganda 
incessantly targeting Canadian jobs and Canadian industry in the 
oilfields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It effectively cancelled 
Energy East, banned future tanker traffic, cancelled Northern Gateway, 
hosted innumerable summits on fighting climate change, instituted a 
national carbon tax, strong-armed Alberta into an illusory deal for "<b>social licence</b>,"
 silently wrote off thousands and thousands of jobs in the process, and 
famously lamented not being able to close down the "carbon economy 
tomorrow." All to earn credits with the internationalist global warming 
consensus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those campaigns for the moment meet and are most intense in British Columbia. The one <b>pipeline</b>
 left on the Canadian drawing board now has for years been hectored and 
harassed, subject to protest and serpentine regulation, and dragged to 
near extinction. In fewer than two weeks we will hear whether <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>, which has spent one billion dollars merely to extend a <b>pipeline</b>
 built in 1953, has tired of the exercise and, exhausted, simply 
abandons the project out of bottomless frustration. They must really 
wonder why, with so little welcome, and up until their deadline, they 
faced a federal government so committed to a cause whose triumph would 
be the negation of all energy industries, anywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back to getting our act 
together. The federal government is also on the ramparts facing the B.C.
 government, with Finance Minister Bill Morneau levelling a caustic 
fusillade this week at B.C. Premier John Horgan and his green cohorts 
for obstructing the national purpose and "unconstitutionally" seeking to
 override federal authority. The federal government is not quite as hot 
over Saskatchewan's demurral to play into its global warming policy of 
the carbon tax, but it has already singled out Saskatchewan for 
financial penalties, withholding federal funds from that province - a 
tactic it will not deploy, however, against the far more contentious 
B.C. This fuels a legitimate charge that the Trudeau Liberals play the 
game unfairly as between provinces, and thereby manufactures a fresh 
friction within our newly fractious federation. Meantime Quebec, never a
 spectator on this file, is on side with B.C., as it was active in 
killing the Energy East <b>pipeline</b> and therefore actively in 
contest with Alberta, and latently with the Atlantic region. Global 
warming is not a buttress of national unity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the rampage stirred 
up by greenism does not stop there. In Ontario, Kathleen Wynne, in every
 other sense a capable and intelligent leader, by adopting the global 
warming cause and making it an Ontario project, has utterly exhausted 
her popularity. The various results of the woeful "green" efforts - 
waste, artful subsidies to renewables, cancellation of gas plants, a 
forest of overpriced windmills, the dread carbon tax, and tumid 
electricity prices - have blistered her apparently irredeemably with the
 voters, and polls suggest has turned her party into political pariahs. 
The only person truly happy about Ontario's green policies has to be 
Doug Ford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within our Indigenous communities division is rife. Those which signed on to <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 plead to be heard and are either never mentioned in all the volatile 
press on the subject, or vastly overwhelmed by the Indigenous activists,
 who in most reporting on this subject earn the headlines and the lead 
story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Atlantic region 
Newfoundland is waking up to the consideration that its offshore 
industry will probably be the next target of the global warming zealots.
 The Maritimes are waking up, too, that they let pass the cancellation 
of Energy East with reckless unconcern. The economy of the region will 
pay for that indifference, and the current perfect cloud of 32 Liberal 
MPs will pay for it too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trudeau government 
vastly overestimates and overpraises the power of "our example to the 
world." This is quite natural. Every author is the ideal reviewer of his
 own book. But to earn even that dubious international status, look at 
the costs at home. Canada's carbon tax, and its high zeal for the cause,
 cannot, in any substantial way, change the equations of the world's 
atmosphere. We are incidental to the problem, if indeed it is a problem.
 Whatever Canada does, or does not do, will not accelerate the crisis or
 diminish it, in any way that is meaningful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its zeal to be seen as
 champion for a problem we have minimal capacity to cure, this 
government has roiled the Canadian political landscape, stirred a 
current of rage in Alberta, set provinces bitterly at odds with each 
other, shattered the governing party in Ontario, placed useless taxes on
 an already depressed industry, and chased billions of dollars of 
investment money out of the country. Most grievously, it has already 
indicated to the world that Canada is a very inhospitable place for any 
projects large in scale that in any way might wander under the eyes and 
objections of global warming zealots, the politicians who support them, 
and governments that are their willing partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world has indeed 
already taken notice that Canada doesn't have its "act together" and 
Canada has already learned that it is "getting harder and harder to get 
its resources to world markets." It is certainly true of the most 
cardinal resource of global commerce, our oil.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York State's $270-billion pension fund will table a shareholder resolution Wednesday at <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s
 annual meetings in Houston, calling for more environmental reporting - a
 proposal officially opposed by the oil company's management.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move comes as controversy swirls around the Texas energy giant's Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b> expansion in B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were initially concerned over the controversy over the <b>pipeline</b>
 and the potential for the reputational risk it was causing the company,
 which hurts shareholder value, and legal liability that could end up 
affecting shareholder value," said Patrick Doherty, the comptroller's 
corporate governance director for New York state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state's comptroller oversees its massive Common Retirement Fund, which holds more than $100 million in <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resolution follows a 
similar one last year that gained more than 34 per cent support among 
shareholders, something observers said is unusually high for such votes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even having 10, 20 or 30
 per cent of your investors telling you something is important to them 
is a message most CEOs will heed in one form or another," said Peter 
Chapman, executive director of the Shareholder Association for Research 
and Education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The social and environmental issues around <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s <b>social licence</b> are important - that has become a big issue with pipe construction across North America."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Wednesday's vote 
could exceed last year's 34.1 per cent support, Doherty said. That's 
because it's being backed by two even larger investors: the $457-billion
 <span class="companylink">California Public Employees' Retirement System</span> - America's largest public pension fund - and Norway's $1.3-trillion Government Pension Fund Global.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are two of the largest institutional investors in the world, and respectively hold $201 million and $146 million in <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> shares.</p>

urging rejection of the resolution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our board unanimously 
opposes this proposal," the document said, raising concerns about its 
current environmental disclosure is sufficient.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less than two weeks

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 Prime Minister is about to ask taxpayers to bail him out of a 
self-inflicted calamity - the inability to ship our oil to overseas 
markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau promised the $7.4 billion Trans Mountain <b>Pipeline</b>
 Expansion (TMX) would be built because it's the last opportunity to 
prevent our vast reserves from being permanently landlocked. Letting the
 project die would cause so much economic, constitutional and 
reputational damage that no amount of spinning could save his government
 from grievous political damage. B.C. Premier John Horgan declared he 
will do everything to kill the <b>pipeline</b>. Trudeau cannot tolerate a
 province thwarting the federal government on a critical matter within 
an exclusive federal jurisdiction. He has to defend the constitution and
 rule of law or the very viability of our confederation will be 
undermined.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover,
 Canada's credibility with foreign investors would be tarnished when 
capital is already heading south because of a dramatic reduction in U.S.
 corporate tax rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau's face-saving 
plan mirrors Ronald Reagan's observation: "If it moves, tax it. If it 
keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it." Due to
 B.C. hostility, federal inaction and regulatory overreach, TMX became 
too risky and expensive. Trudeau and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley 
exacerbated the problem when they naively proposed a grand bargain 
doomed to fail - impose a costly carbon tax in exchange for the <b>social licence</b>
 to construct Trans Mountain. Now the Feds, perhaps with the Province of
 Alberta, will write a whopping cheque or provide indemnification to <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> or another private investor, possibly accompanied by support for First Nations' investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most Canadians understand
 our oil must not be stranded. The opportunity cost of this project 
alone is estimated at $74 billion in revenue over 20 years. For a 
country with 10% of global proven reserves not to export its fossil fuel
 would be unconscionable madness. However, Trudeau is caught in an 
exquisite dilemma of his own making. According to a Nanos poll, over 
two-thirds of Canadians support the project, yet two-thirds oppose the 
use of taxpayers dollars to fund it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Prime Minister is responsible for why TMX is the lastgasp opportunity to access tidewater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He rejected the $7.9 billion Northern Gateway <b>pipeline</b> after Enbridge received the go-ahead from the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board (NEB) </span>and the previous Conservative cabinet. Then <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> cancelled the $15.7 billion Energy East <b>pipeline</b> because the <span class="companylink">NEB</span>
 extravagantly expanded the scope of its review to include downstream 
emissions. Since the government didn't overrule its regulator, Trudeau 
cannot hide behind its project-killing policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, the new Impact 
Assessment Act politicized the review process and exacerbated 
uncertainty to such an extent that no private sector sponsor will ever 
propose a major <b>pipeline</b> again unless the legislation is 
fundamentally changed. Think about it. The government of a fabulously 
oilrich country has precluded overseas sales. Ironically, that would 
harm the environment since exporting Canadian crude could replace higher
 greenhouse gas emitting coal and lessen foreign imports arriving by 
tanker up the Saint Lawrence River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau won't punish 
British Columbians by withholding infrastructure funding or social 
transfers since that would damage his electoral prospects in 18 Liberal 
seats in the Lower Mainland. It would also send a provocative signal 
about federal power to Quebec with its 40 Liberal seats and whose 
moribund sovereigntists are always one perceived outrage away from 
resurgence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau will try to take 
credit for rescuing Trans Mountain. That is like a CEO whose blunders 
drove a company to the brink, but demands a bonus when shareholders are 
forced to inject funds to keep it afloat. The executive should be fired.
 Next year, voters will determine Trudeau's fate.</p>

 leader of Canada’s Conservative Party insists his party would meet the 
Paris climate accord targets, but would not speculate on how it would do
 so. While Andrew Scheer is committed to dumping the federal carbon tax,
 he was mum on how his unfinished climate plan could impact on the oil 
and gas industry, one of Canada’s major greenhouse gas emitters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I am committed to 
ensuring that Canada plays its role [in the Paris accord]; you’ll pardon
 me for not unveiling every aspect or try to tip my hand. We are doing a
 tremendous amount of work to come up with a comprehensive plan on the 
environment,” Scheer said after an appearance at a Calgary Chamber of 
Commerce luncheon on Friday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I
 think there is a lot that can be done through incentives and through 
investments in research and technology, and that's always better than 
imposing a new tax on Canadian families.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a question and answer 
session with Sandip Lalli, president and CEO of the Calgary Chamber, 
Scheer blamed the governing federal Liberals for delays in construction 
of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>’s $7.4-billion Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b> expansion, but said little about how a Conservative government would get it built in a more expeditious fashion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was cool on the idea 
of putting taxpayers dollars into the project or calling in the military
 should opposition on the ground attempt to further delay the project. <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> has set a May 31 deadline for the uncertainty around the project to be resolved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I believe very firmly that the issue around <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 is set in the backdrop of several decisions that were taken that 
shattered the confidence in Canada's energy sector,” he said, pointing 
to the cancelations of the Northern Gateway and Energy East <b>pipeline</b> proposals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And we have to talk 
about the carbon tax, which is a huge competitive disadvantage. When you
 put all that together, and then we see a provincial government taking 
action, that’s the tipping point for a project proponent. We called on 
Justin Trudeau to have a meeting with Premier [John] Horgan and Premier 
[Rachel] Notley months ago [and] nothing happened. The prime minister 
has the entire department of Natural Resources, the Department of 
Justice, at his disposal to come up with a plan. We are only now 
starting to talk about legislation to entrench and defend the relevant 
sections of the Constitution. We could have been having those debates, 
those conversations, taking those steps, back in January, February, even
 before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What a terrible 
indictment of his handling of this file. I am very disappointed and I 
sense the frustration here in Calgary and here in Alberta. It’s an 
emotional response because it’s their friends and neighbours who have 
been affected by this,” Scheer said. “I think everyone can agree, 
regardless of their political stripes, that the federal government 
investing tax dollars&nbsp;in an energy project is not the optimal 
solution. It’s come to here because of&nbsp;[Trudeau's] failures.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prime minister needs to be working with <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 to provide the confidence and the assurances that “it is not about the 
money, it’s not about taxpayers dollars. It’s about a plan, it’s about a
 timeline that they can work with in getting that project built in that 
timeline. I believe that if that was the focus then the use of 
government funds wouldn't be necessary,” said Scheer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, he said the <b>pipeline</b>
 has become a symbol for a larger issue. “I believe it’s essential to 
take a step back and remember how we got to where we are, and why is 
Trans Mountain the focal point. And it starts with right before the 
election where you have Justin Trudeau undermining the credibility of 
our science-based independent regulatory bodies who have for decades 
approved pipelines based on data and facts, and where there were 
improvements needed, ordered companies to make those improvements, and 
it worked. Canadians had confidence in it, until Justin Trudeau 
politicized it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So now all eyes are on 
Trans Mountain, the hardest of the three to get built because&nbsp;it 
is&nbsp;going right through the heart of the very place where the 
protesters are more prevalent, who have also been emboldened by the 
prime minister saying that they must give permission through <b>social licence</b> before projects can go ahead.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has now devolved into a
 “bizarre situation where we have a private company wanting to use 
shareholders money to build a project that would create jobs and 
economic activity in Canada, and the Liberal response is, well we are 
going to have to subsidize you to get to do that…. It should never have 
come to this. Hopefully we won’t be in the opposition too long and we 
can start to actually use the power of the federal government to get 
these important projects built.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked if he would consider bringing in the Canadian military to expedite <b>pipeline</b>
 construction, Scheer said: “I don’t think we have to get to there quite
 honestly. I think that that is something that the left would love to 
conjure up images of. There is a lot of space between here and there…. 
And in many cases it’s actually not the protesters that are the problem,
 it’s the NDP government of British Columbia that is the problem right 
now, and the RCMP and municipal police forces have to enforce the law. 
People don't get to just decide which laws to follow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think it is up to the 
federal government to make sure that the law is followed,” Scheer noted.
 “We have to be a country of laws. We can’t have people who disagree 
with the decision — a duly passed law or a legitimate use of the power 
of the government — we can’t allow these people who disagree with that 
to break the law, they don't have the right to do that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questioned about how the provinces are handling the <b>pipeline</b>
 impasse, Scheer found no fault with the Alberta government, but laid 
blame almost entirely on the federal government. “I think Premier Notley
 is in a tough spot, and whoever was premier of Alberta would be in a 
very difficult position, having to deal with British Columbia, but I 
don't want to focus on what one province should or should not [be] doing
 because my issue is that Justin Trudeau has done literally nothing for 
over a year and he has shown a complete lack of leadership and has 
forced provinces to take matters into their own hands, and they 
shouldn't have to do that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Social licence</b></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scheer also said the meaning of <b>social licence</b>
 has to remain science-based. “It’s funny [how] we have to define this 
now because it has been a term that has kind of been invented by the 
left, but I think fundamentally we have systems in place where experts 
and those that know&nbsp;the issue intimately, because&nbsp;they have 
got the training and they have the scientific credentials, are delegated
 to make decisions for us based on their best observations. And this 
isn't just about the energy sector,” he said. “Whether it’s a planned 
road or an LRT or a subway line, we have to have a decision-making 
process that citizens can have confidence in and then live with the 
decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As long as you have a transparent process based on a non-political approach to these things, then that is where <b>social licence</b> rests.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supercluster initiative</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In regard to innovation, 
Lalli noted, “other countries have been successful around clustering” in
 reference to the federal government’s $1 billion supercluster 
initiative, and asked what a Conservative government would do to promote
 innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s easy for 
governments to spend money and have big announcements,” Scheer said. 
“What is not seen is the cost of spending that billion dollars. And all 
the little decisions that get made for an entire economy because the 
government has made those choices and perhaps not other choices, or 
because they had to collect those taxes and take them out of the economy
 in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And then you have the 
idea that governments somehow can predict where these things are going 
to happen. I think a big fallacy for many politicians, certainly those 
of the Liberals and the NDP, is that there is somehow this giant 
switchboard that manages the economy and we can pull levers and turn 
dials and push buttons and we can grow the economy by having people in 
Ottawa guess and predict and do things better, and I don't agree with 
that at all. I think that the organic nature in which the free market 
works is always, always better than planned economies or decisions being
 made in government offices.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Internal, external trade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scheer said a 
Conservative government would work to ensure free trade among Canadian 
provinces. The current state of internal trade barriers, on items like 
alcohol, which was recently upheld by the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>,
 doesn’t send a good signal when negotiating trade deals with other 
countries. “It weakens our moral position, but also it weakens our 
economic position.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>, Scheer challenged the Trump administration’s sector-by-sector approach. “We have a challenge with <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>
 and the Conservative party has certainly tried to do what we can to 
support the government’s efforts. We have been critical with them here 
at home&nbsp;when we think they have missed opportunities,” he said. 
“But we have spoken with a united front when we go to the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have a particular 
challenge with the Trump administration, and that is, the U.S. 
administration right now is looking at trade along the lines of a 
sector-by-sector surplus or deficit calculation, so instead of looking 
at a trading relationship as a whole and saying, on the whole, what’s 
our trade surplus or deficit, what’s the economic impact, they are 
really drilling down into steel and aluminum and agriculture and 
manufacturing and auto,” and in any one of those sectors, not accepting 
the U.S. having a trade deficit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That's not an 
appropriate way to evaluate a trading relationship because as you know, 
every country does some things well and some things better and relies 
and benefits from another country doing other things well. For example, 
Canada has a massive deficit when it comes to citrus fruit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And as well we want [the
 federal government] to focus on jobs,” he added. “They are bringing a 
lot of social issues to the negotiation table that really don’t speak to
 market access and the jobs that go with that. So we think they should 
stay focused on keeping trade barriers away and improving market access 
for Canadian goods and services.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Productivity</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked what his government
 would do to increase productivity and help small and medium sized 
business to scale up, Scheer pointed to reforms to education to better 
target students to jobs. “One of the things we can do … is link skills 
training with available jobs, and rather than the model that many 
governments use which is to have the bulk of their&nbsp;focus on skills 
training going to other levels of government and then on through, kind 
of following the student.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We could also have 
support that goes to where the job is. So rather than say to a student, 
here is funding and you pick what you would like, part of the solution 
could be saying, OK, here is a training partnership with a company that 
knows that right now or in three or five years, there are going to be 
these types of jobs available, and attract the people to those jobs so 
that students aren't getting qualified or training in areas where there 
aren't jobs available, or where they likely won’t be. In other words, 
allow the market to play more of a role in allocating resources for 
skills training,” he said.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps
 easy to miss amid the understandable political uproar over Canadian 
pipelines (or perhaps more appropriately, our apparent inability to 
build them) was the <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span> Monthly Merchandise Trade Report in February that tracks Canada's international balance of trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report indicated 
Canada's trade deficit amounted to $2.7 billion, which widened from $1.9
 billion from the prior month, with imports advancing 1.9 per cent 
month-over-month, mostly due to higher purchases of energy products.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hidden
 within those summary numbers was the revelation that imports of energy 
products into Canada advanced by a material 15.4 per cent to $3.4 
billion, the highest level since November 2014, with the largest share 
of those imports originating from the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The importation of crude 
oil and bitumen advanced 15.4 per cent, with imported refined petroleum 
products up by 24.1 per cent, the latter due largely to increased 
imports of gasoline into B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's increased importation of oil and its products reflects a growing trend in the past two years since the <span class="companylink">U.S. Congress</span> ended a 40-year ban on oil exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accompanied by surging 
U.S. production, crude oil exports from the U.S. to Canada (seasonally 
adjusted), have risen from $6.4 billion from September 2015 to February 
2016, to $8.4 billion from September 2017 to February of this year, or 
by about a third.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While these numbers 
fluctuate monthly, the point is that in February, while Canada exported 
$8.8 billion in energy, it also imported $3.38 billion from 
international sources, which, according to <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span>, represents a year-to-year increase of 12.3 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada produces far more 
oil than it can consume, and hence it is the world's fourth largest 
producer and third largest exporter of oil. In 2016, Canada was the 
largest foreign supplier of crude oil to the U.S., with 99 per cent of 
our oil exports directed there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada accounted for 41 per cent of total U.S. crude oil imports and 20 per cent of U.S. refinery crude oil intake. However, <span class="companylink">Natural Resources Canada</span>
 also indicated that in 2016, Canada imported crude oil and equivalents 
from many countries, including the United States (62 per cent), Saudi 
Arabia, Algeria, Nigeria and Norway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when Canadian attentions, both public and political, are riveted on our pernicious lack of <b>pipeline</b>
 access to international oil markets, we question why so little 
attention is being paid to Canada's increasing importation of petroleum 
products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It cost Canadians $3.4 
billion in February alone. To be clear, we are not arguing a trade 
surplus or deficit is an appropriate barometer of a country's health. 
However, we do suggest growing U.S. exports, due to deregulation, and 
our inability to build infrastructure to export our energy, is not 
beneficial to Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada could enhance its 
security of supply, reduce its trade deficit and produce fewer global 
greenhouse gas emissions if we used more of our Canadian crude oil 
production. A recent study by the <span class="companylink">Canadian Energy Research Institute</span>,
 using 2016 data, indicates that substituting Canadian oil wherever 
possible using space on existing pipelines, rail cars and ocean tankers,
 could reduce foreign oil imports into Eastern Canada by a whopping 47 
per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This would save 
refineries $210 million and reduce Canadian emissions of carbon dioxide 
by the equivalent of more than two million tonnes, or about 5.7 per cent
 annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute also found 
that eastern Canadian refineries process just over one million barrels 
of oil per day, of which only 39 per cent originates from Western Canada
 and five per cent originates from the eastern Canadian offshore; fully 
56 per cent is imported from the United States (amounting to 260,000 
barrels of imported oil per day).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly, lower regulatory
 and fiscal costs would benefit all Canadians through the more efficient
 utilization of Canadian resources. Hence, we urgently need better 
policies to resolve our <b>pipeline</b> infrastructure problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a precarious B.C. 
government opposes oil pipelines, the Trudeau government's avowed 
transition away from fossil fuels appears perversely to be directed 
solely at penalizing Canadian producers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is overregulating 
domestic producers with misdirected policies that allow foreign 
petroleum imports - unimpeded by Canadian environmental laws, so-called <b>social licence</b>,
 greenhouse gas reduction strategies and associated taxes - to flood 
into Canada to displace jobs and discourage investment. Ron Wallace has 
served on federal, provincial and territorial energy and environmental 
regulators and advisory boards. Jack Mintz is the president's fellow at

 BC, April 27, 2018 /CNW/ - A new Insights West opinion poll indicates 
12 per cent of British Columbians are now willing to engage in civil 
disobedience to stop <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> from building its new <b>pipeline</b>
 to export bitumen through the province. This percentage has increased 
from seven per cent in November 2017, to 10 per cent in February 2018, 
and to 12 per cent in April 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The April polling also provides a profile of the type of people willing to engage in civil disobedience to delay or stop the <b>pipeline</b>.
 Men and women are equally likely to consider engaging in civil 
disobedience with these intentions equally spread across age and income 
groups as well as provincial region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"More and more British Columbians are willing to engage in civil disobedience to stop Justin Trudeau's efforts to push his <b>pipeline</b>
 through B.C. as evidenced by these poll results and the mounting number
 of arrests," states Kennedy Stewart, Member of Parliament for Burnaby 
South, who commissioned the poll. "People from all walks of life are 
standing up to oppose this project which clearly lacks the <b>social licence</b> needed to proceed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of those who voted for 
the federal New Democratic Party in the October 2015 federal election, 
24 per cent would consider engaging in civil disobedience; followed by 
15 per cent who voted for parties other than federal NDP, Liberal, or 
Conservative; 11 per cent of Liberal voters; and two per cent of 
Conservative voters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This polling data counters the idea that <b>pipeline</b> opposition is confined to a radical group. The results show that intentions to block the <b>pipeline</b>
 extend equally to men and women, young and old, rich and poor, and 
across all regions of the province," says Stewart. "While federal New 
Democratic Party supporters appear to be most willing to put their 
bodies on the line, a significant proportion of Green and Liberal Party

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nelson Star -- The Trans Mountain Expansion <b>pipeline</b> has dominated news in the past few weeks. The public is divided over whether we should build this <b>pipeline</b> and allow Alberta oil sands output to increase, or whether it presents too much risk to BC's rivers and coastal environments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many experts described 
the original project approval process as deeply flawed. The Liberals 
ignored their campaign promise of a new, improved process and instead 
sent a ministerial panel along the <b>pipeline</b> route in the summer 
of 2016. Many communities and First Nations governments criticized this 
process as inadequate as well. However the panel did write a report that
 ended with a list of six clear questions for the government to answer 
before making a decision.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think it would be useful to review those questions to see more clearly how we got into this quagmire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Can construction of a new Trans Mountain <b>Pipeline</b> be reconciled with Canada's climate change commitments? Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr often proclaims "This <b>pipeline</b> will be built", but I have never heard him say "We will meet our Paris targets." For many <b>pipeline</b> opponents this is the crux of the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. In the absence of a 
comprehensive national energy strategy, how can policy-makers 
effectively assess projects such as the Trans Mountain <b>Pipeline</b>? 
Canada needs a national energy strategy that would answer broader 
questions such as: what role new pipelines would play in a world where 
world oil demand (according to the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>
 itself) will begin declining in 2019; how we might refine our oil 
resources for our own use rather than exporting bitumen and importing 
foreign oil on the Atlantic coast; and how we can create good jobs in 
renewable energy as the world shifts to a low carbon future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. How might Cabinet square approval of the Trans Mountain <b>Pipeline</b>
 with its commitment to reconciliation with First Nations and to the 
UNDRIP principles of "free, prior, and informed consent?" This is 
perhaps the key question that the federal government failed to answer 
before it approved the Trans Mountain Expansion. There is strong 
opposition to the project from many First Nations, and a number of 
lawsuits are in the courts arguing that the approval process did not 
involve proper consultation. If this is found to be the case (as it was 
in the Northern Gateway <b>pipeline</b> decision) it could delay the project another year or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. Given the changed 
economic and political circumstances, the perceived flaws in the NEB 
process, and also the criticism of the Ministerial Panel's own review, 
how can Canada be confident in its assessment of the project's economic 
rewards and risks? According to Nanos Research only 2% of Canadians have
 strong confidence in Canada's energy regulation system, a fact that 
bears on the discontent seen on both sides of this debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. If approved, what 
route would best serve aquifer, municipal, aquatic and marine safety? 
Kinder Morgan has not yet asked the government for approval of the exact
 route for much of the <b>pipeline</b>; in many cases the old route will not be followed, especially in the Lower Mainland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6. How does federal policy define the terms "<b>social licence</b>"
 and "Canadian public interest" and their inter-relationships? Through 
the election campaign, Justin Trudeau repeated the mantra "governments 
can grant permits, but only communities grant permission". The federal 
government now finds itself in a very difficult situation, having to 
tell coastal British Columbians that the project is in the national 
interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is now too late to 
answer these questions before Kinder Morgan's self-imposed deadline of 
May 31, but we would have been in a much better situation had the 
government fully dealt with them before approving the Trans Mountain 
expansion project.</p>

Will this country ever build a <b>pipeline</b> to tidewater again? Unfortunately, these are questions that need to be asked now that the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b> project has been thrown into jeopardy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As I'm sure you've heard, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> announced it is suspending work on the project. They are worried the <b>pipeline</b>
 will be tied up indefinitely, and who can blame them? The prime 
minister failed to take immediate action to address the situation with 
the British Columbia government. The Liberals already vetoed the 
Northern Gateway <b>pipeline</b>, a political decision that had nothing to do with science. Then they killed Energy East with last-minute regulatory changes.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What
 kind of signal is this sending to anyone wanting to invest in Canadian 
energy? It's no surprise that the Liberals have now presided over the 
biggest decline in Canadian energy investment in 70 years - a loss of 
$80 billion dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On April 14, the prime 
minister finally announced that he might be working on a plan for the 
Trans Mountain project. But he needs taxpayer dollars to do it. <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> didn't ask for tax dollars - they want to get to work on the <b>pipeline</b>, and they just need a guarantee it will go ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether you agree with 
this course of action or not, it is an indictment of this government's 
policies that the private sector might now need tax dollars to be 
convinced to build something in this country (and the verdict is still 
out on whether even that will be enough). Furthermore, a government 
stake in the project won't do anything to placate those holding up the 
project with their opposition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As recently as last week 
(while on a trip to France), the prime minister said he wants to "phase 
out" the Canadian energy sector. We now have the carbon tax, regulatory 
changes, and inaction on Trans Mountain as proof that he means what he 
said. Despite their promises, this government's policies have done 
nothing to secure the so-called "<b>social licence</b>" we were told was needed to build approved pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Needless to say, this is 
bad for Canada - and especially Alberta. Energy companies don't just 
provide employment - they actively invest in our communities. Thousands 
of community centres, hockey rinks and neighbourhood events across our 
province are sponsored by energy companies. Not to mention important 
services, such as the STARS Air Ambulance. If the energy companies 
leave, we lose an incredibly important community partner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To all those who have 
written to members of parliament, attended rallies, and shown their 
support for Canadian energy - thank you. I know there are so many people
 who have lost their jobs and suffered needless hardships because of 
this government's decisions. Please know that we will keep up the fight 
in Ottawa. The best way to get the Canadian energy sector back on track 
is to replace this Liberal government in 2019.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute released 
further analysis on data it collected last week — immediately following 
Trudeau's meeting with B.C. and Alberta's premiers — that showed growing
 support for the <b>pipeline</b> nationwide. <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 has currently suspended all non-essential spending on the project and 
says it will decide whether to pull out completely by May 31.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week's poll showed most Canadians (58 per cent) think <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> could have done more to gain <b>social licence</b> before breaking ground. Even those who support the <b>pipeline</b> (56 per cent), share that opinion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has had years to engage Canadians, Shachi Kurl, executive director of Angus Reid Institute, pointed out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is newer to the national landscape but we [in B.C.] have been talking about this <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> expansions since 2012,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“British Columbians are certainly of the view that the company could have done a better job.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings also point to <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s
 lack of success in reaching residents, she said. Many of Canada's 
politicians are on-board with the project, but voters are not 
necessarily receiving the same message, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“How many people can name
 the CEO or a single leader at the company. How front and centre have 
they been in leading the conversation or the debate?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, protestors — 
both abroad, like this weekend's demonstration in London, and at home, 
like the protest camp on Burnaby Mountain — dominate news coverage. But 
poll results show that demonstrations make Canadians more likely to 
support the <b>pipeline</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Alberta, where 
opposition is staunchest, this phenomenon is especially evident: almost 
half (48 per cent) of Albertans say they are more likely to support the <b>pipeline</b> due to the protests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Protestors have the effect of preaching to the converted sometimes, Kurl explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They can excite their 
base. They can recommit people if they are mildly opposed and certainly,
 protests can raise awareness and result in the hardening of views,” she
 said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But they aren't necessarily a vehicle to change peoples' minds.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six in 10 Canadians report that the protestors don't represent mainstream views, according to the Angus Reid Institute report.</p>

 could have done a better job of earning public support, and brought

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The debate over the Trans
 Mountain project has captured the nation’s attention. More than half of
 Canadians say they’re paying close attention to this issue — including 
majorities in every region other than Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do the protesters have public support?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Protesters have been involved in directly confronting <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 on Burnaby Mountain since 2014. Indeed, the first arrests began in 
November of that year, as more than 100 people were detained for 
disrupting survey work and drilling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the project has 
continued, protests have increased. Since March of this year roughly 200
 more people have been arrested, including federal Green Party leader 
Elizabeth May and federal NDP MP Kennedy Stewart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While protesters have 
vowed to continue, most Canadians are not of the belief that this group 
represents the mainstream view of their neighbours. In fact, six-in-10 
Canadians say this group represents a fringe view, while just 23 per 
cent disagree:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horgan has abstained from
 condemning or praising the protesters on Burnaby Mountain. He recently 
suggested that his government should not bear responsibility for dealing
 with further protests, saying “I believe the federal government should 
be accountable for the circumstances we find ourselves in at this time.”
 For their part, close to half of Canadians (46 per cent) say that he 
should be doing more to condemn the actions of protests, but a 
significant number disagree (34 per cent). In B.C., an equal number take
 either side on this proposition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Majority say <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> brought troubles upon itself</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many opponents — including Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, president of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs — claim that <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> did not attain “consent or <b>social licence</b>”
 from British Columbians and Indigenous peoples for this project, which 
has led to conflict and delays. A majority of Canadians agree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six-in-10 (58 per cent) say that <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> brought much of this problem upon themselves by not ensuring <b>social licence</b> was gained, and just one-in-five (20 per cent) disagree.

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is in the middle of a <b>pipeline</b> crisis because three of the four main actors in this drama need a <b>pipeline</b> but don't want one. Meanwhile, the fourth actor wants one but doesn't really need it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three politicians in 
this circus - Alberta NDP Premier Rachel Notley, Liberal Prime Minister 
Justin Trudeau and B.C. NDP Premier John Horgan - are all "greenies" and
 would rather <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s Trans Mountain expansion not be built for environmental reasons.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet for one reason or another, all three of them need Trans Mountain (even though Horgan won't admit his need publicly yet).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley and Trudeau want 
Trans Mountain the least. They have drunk the "green" Kool-Aid and truly
 think our atmosphere is going to hell in a <b>pipeline</b>. They are committed to the notion that Canada can (and should) end the use of fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only reason Notley and Trudeau are now defending Trans Mountain is that both need it for fiscal and political reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley clings to the hope that if she can get a <b>pipeline</b>
 well underway before next spring's provincial election, she will be 
able to convince enough Alberta voters to stop hating her government 
enough that her NDP can sneak a second term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She also knows there is no way Alberta's budget will ever be balanced again without the revenues associated with at least one <b>pipeline</b>. All the wind turbines and solar farms in the country can't replace the revenues from oil and gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, Notley bet the house on "<b>social licence</b>"
 - the theory that if Alberta self-inflicted enough economic pain in the
 name of the environment, other provinces and eco-protesters would 
welcome our pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, <b>social licence</b> hasn't worked because it was never going to work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, Notley was 
so confident in her airy-fairy theory that she gave Quebec a veto over 
Energy East: Don't like our climate plan? Don't take our <b>pipeline</b>! So, of course, because the Quebec government never wanted the <b>pipeline</b> for political reasons, they were only too happy to help kill Energy East by insisting the eco plan didn't go far enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So now, for political and budgetary reasons, Notley absolutely must produce a completed Trans Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Notley, Trudeau needs <b>pipeline</b> revenues to rebalance his government's budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And since Trudeau and his
 government created environmental rules that made it impossible for 
other pipelines to go ahead - such as Northern Gateway and Energy East -
 Trudeau's <b>pipeline</b> eggs are now all in <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s basket, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ironically, of the three,
 Horgan is perhaps the most pro-development (or maybe that should be the
 least anti-development). Still, he is forced to be the most vocal 
opponent because the British Columbians most likely to vote NDP are also
 those most against <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>. More
 importantly, his governing coalition is being held in power by three 
Green MLAs who would likely abandon him and force an election if he 
allowed Trans Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But consider this: The 
Horgan government needs resource revenues, too. And it knows B.C. voters
 like LNG (liquified natural gas). So when it is ready for another 
election, the B.C. NDP will likely approve LNG, triggering the Greens to
 bring the government down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that brings us to why Horgan could end up needing Trans Mountain as much as Notley and Trudeau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The feds could withhold federal approval of LNG until Horgan permits a <b>pipeline</b> to be built across B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And since Trans Mountain is the only <b>pipeline</b>
 still out there ... Kinder Morgan, of course, is the one player that 
truly wants Trans Mountain. But it has signalled it may no longer need 
it and will walk away. Which is why two of the actors who need the <b>pipeline</b> for political reasons are talking about buying Trans Mountain They'll use our tax dollars to enhance their political fortunes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the nation mourning Humboldt's loss, pecking out an obstinate tweet about an oil <b>pipeline</b>
 wasn't at the top of Justin Trudeau's to-do list, yet out came the 
above tweet ahead of the prime minister joining members of the shattered
 community for last Sunday's vigil.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome
 to government, where events never pause and most days are an endless 
series of bad and worse choices. Trudeau is certainly down to bad and 
worse on <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau might want this <b>pipeline</b>
 built, but if the company is wavering and the Green party-dependent NDP
 premier of the province through which it must pass hasn't yet found a 
body he won't chuck in front of it, at what point do you concede the 
Earth will not be moving? The answer from Team Trudeau is a ringing "not
 now, not ever."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are determined to see
 (Trans Mountain) built," Trudeau has told reporters. "It is in the 
national interest. It doesn't make any sense for us to continue to have a
 $15-billion discount on our oil resources because we are trapped with 
an American market. We need to get our resources to new markets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same words could have and did come out of Stephen Harper's mouth. Trudeau now has to bell the cat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't meant to be this way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harper's confrontational "cramthem-down-your-throats" <b>pipeline</b> policy was to be replaced with Trudeau's more charismatic approach that would accrue the "<b>social licence</b>" needed to grease construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Trans Mountain 
ultimately proves is 20 years of debate in Canada has split people into 
two irreconcilable camps: pro-oil and anti-oil. Preening at climate 
summits and taxing carbon won't make exporting oil kosher to those who 
are resolutely opposed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Giddy though the 
opposition parties might be, now is not the time for them to revel in 
Trudeau's mire. Seeing your opponent hoisted with his own petard is 
satisfying, but if the <b>pipeline</b> really is in Canada's national interest, the opposition should offer some constructive suggestions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the partisan urge is 
too strong. Further disincentivizing bipartisan efforts is the Trudeau 
carbon tax that is not particularly well-read by any capital-C 
Conservative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau shoulders a good 
chunk of the blame. His Pan Canadian Framework for Clean Energy and 
Climate Change with its plan for carbon "pricing" was effectively 
crammed down provincial throats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And with Rachel Notley 
and Kathleen Wynne's governments now in severe financial distress, 
voters there and across Canada will begin to wonder why they're on the 
road to higher taxes if those uppity British Columbians aren't holding 
up their end of the <b>social-licence</b> bargain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is where federal NDP
 leader Jagmeet Singh should have a useful intervention to make, given 
it's his provincial family on opposite sides of the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> dispute. But Singh has sided with B.C. and its brighter federal electoral prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government can, and should, re-assert its constitutional right to build the <b>pipeline</b>. And yes, the feds can join Alberta in slapping down money and insurance guarantees. But that's only half the battle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the communities along the <b>pipeline</b>
 route remain ready to obstruct its construction, it's going to take a 
lot more than bucks and words to clear the way. Even the stern words of a
 judge urging protesters out of the way might not do the trick. What 
then? Do the sunny ways of Trudeau allow for a hint of the army steel 
flashed by his father? Do we just watch him? Andrew MacDougall is a

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was not inevitable that we should arrive at such a pass over the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b>
 expansion: province divided against province, First Nation against 
First Nation, with the economic union and the rule of law as potential 
collateral damage. A debacle this big does not come about without years 
of hard work on all sides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We should be clear on one thing: this is not a debate about a <b>pipeline</b>, or not any longer. It is about who decides.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reasonable
 people will differ on the merits of Trans Mountain. But whatever 
anyone's opinion, there is a lawful process for deciding these things, 
and lawful authority to decide them. In the present case, those lawful 
authorities are the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>, the federal cabinet, and the courts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever anyone's 
concerns - economic, environmental, Indigenous or other - that is the 
process by which those concerns are adjudicated. And that is the process
 that approved the <b>pipeline</b>: the <span class="companylink">NEB</span>,
 the cabinet and the courts, all ruling in its favour (though not every 
legal appeal has been exhausted: a case is still before the Federal 
Court of Appeal on behalf of seven First Nations arguing they were not 
adequately consulted). Why, then, do so many feel entitled, not merely 
to disagree, or to protest, as is their democratic right, but to 
substitute their own authority for that prescribed by law: to defy the 
courts, to threaten disorder, and to deny federal jurisdiction? Much of 
the blame should be attached to the custodians of lawful authority, the 
governments of Canada and British Columbia. It was Justin Trudeau who, 
campaigning for office, gave his imprimatur to the extralegal, 
anti-democratic doctrine of "<b>social licence</b>," telling <b>pipeline</b> opponents that "governments might grant permits, but only communities can grant permission."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was Trudeau, too, who 
lent support to the notion that Indigenous communities have, not merely a
 constitutional right to be consulted on projects affecting lands to 
which they have title, as the courts have found they have, but an 
absolute veto. And it was Trudeau who legitimized those who, because 
they did not like the <span class="companylink">NEB</span>'s decision, had dismissed it as biased or negligent, with his promise of a special panel to review the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, it was John Horgan who, campaigning for office, famously promised to "use every tool in the toolbox" to stop the <b>pipeline</b>
 from being built. We know now that his government has known since at 
least the time it took office that it had no constitutional authority to
 do so. But if Horgan had hoped to walk back the promise, in the grand 
tradition of Canadian politics, after he was elected, he finds his way 
blocked by his partners in power, the Green Party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So he has instead opted 
to stall for time, delaying permits, threatening legislation, and - 
someday, maybe - referring the whole business to the courts, hoping the 
project's sponsor, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>, will 
give up in frustration. As, at length, it has declared it will do if 
Horgan's government is not brought to heel, with spectacular effect: it 
has spurred the Trudeau government to state, in terms that allow no 
retreat, that "the <b>pipeline</b> will be built."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But reasserting lawful 
authority, after so many years of disuse, will not be as easy as all 
that. It is not only the Trudeau or Horgan governments, after all, that 
have played this game: before Horgan, there was Christy Clark and her 
constitutionally odious "five conditions" for "approving" the Northern 
Gateway <b>pipeline</b>, and before Trudeau there were decades of 
federal governments that allowed the provinces to run the jurisdictional
 table against them, in the name of "co-operative federalism."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trans Mountain marks the 
final terminus of that process: as it is not possible for the feds to 
cave, so they are forced to act, in spite of themselves. That holds 
great peril - not for nothing did the government of Quebec, sensing a 
precedent, warn the feds not to intervene - but also great promise. But 
it will require great dexterity: a mixture of firmness and delicacy. 
Ottawa cannot simply snap its fingers and force the <b>pipeline</b> through - not at acceptable political cost, at any rate. But it can prevail, if it is patient and wise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this regard, the mix of measures emerging as federal strategy, belated as they are, show much promise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first: legislation explicitly asserting and defining federal authority over the <b>pipeline</b>,
 in some detail. That doesn't abolish B.C.'s recourse to the courts - 
nothing can - but leaves less room for it to exploit any ambiguities 
about federal intentions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second: some form of financial backstop to <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>,
 to assure it that its investment in a lawfully approved project will 
not be devalued, in whole or in part, by B.C.'s dilatory tactics. I have
 seen this denounced as a subsidy or bailout. The details will matter (a
 loan or equity stake would be inferior to a simple promissory note) but
 in principle it seems rather in the nature of compensation for 
expropriation - though it would be appropriate for the feds to recoup 
any payout from B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the third: some sort 
of face-saving sop to the B.C. government - more spending on protective 
measures in the event of a spill, for example. It may seem galling to 
reward it for its intransigence, but it is also probably necessary to 
smooth the path of eventual acquiescence, and gives it something to wave
 at the Greens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, yes. There is a 
fourth, unstated, part: legislation, now before the Alberta legislature,
 empowering the province to throttle supplies of conventional oil to 
B.C. The feds, to be sure, would have no part in such a flagrantly 
unconstitutional exercise, nor should they. But every good cop needs a 
bad cop.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The
 Trans Mountain expansion will be built." With the nation mourning 
Humboldt's loss, pecking out an obstinate tweet about an oil <b>pipeline</b>
 wasn't at the top of Justin Trudeau's to-do list, yet out came the 
above tweet ahead of the prime minister joining members of the shattered
 community for last Sunday's vigil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome to government, 
where events never pause and most days are an endless series of bad and 
worse choices. Trudeau is certainly down to bad and worse on <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau might want this <b>pipeline</b>
 built, but if the company is wavering and the Green party-dependent NDP
 premier of the province through which it must pass hasn't yet found a 
body he won't chuck in front of it, at what point do you concede the 
Earth will not be moving? The answer from Team Trudeau is a ringing "not
 now, not ever." "We are determined to see (Trans Mountain) built," 
Trudeau has told reporters. "It is in the national interest. It doesn't 
make any sense for us to continue to have a $15-billion discount on our 
oil resources because we are trapped with an American market. We need to
 get our resources to new markets." The same words could have and did 
come out of Stephen Harper's mouth. Trudeau now has to bell the cat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't meant to be this way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harper's confrontational "cramthem-down-your-throats" <b>pipeline</b> policy was to be replaced with Trudeau's more charismatic approach that would accrue the "<b>social licence</b>" needed to grease construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Trans Mountain 
ultimately proves is 20 years of debate in Canada has split people into 
two irreconcilable camps: pro-oil and anti-oil. Preening at climate 
summits and taxing carbon won't make exporting oil kosher to those who 
are resolutely opposed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Giddy though the 
opposition parties might be, now is not the time for them to revel in 
Trudeau's mire. Seeing your opponent hoisted with his own petard is 
satisfying, but if the <b>pipeline</b> really is in Canada's national interest, the opposition should offer some constructive suggestions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the partisan urge is 
too strong. Further disincentivizing bipartisan efforts is the Trudeau 
carbon tax that is not particularly well-read by any capital-C 
Conservative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau shoulders a good 
chunk of the blame. His Pan Canadian Framework for Clean Energy and 
Climate Change with its plan for carbon "pricing" was effectively 
crammed down provincial throats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And with Rachel Notley 
and Kathleen Wynne's governments now in severe financial distress, 
voters there and across Canada will begin to wonder why they're on the 
road to higher taxes if those uppity British Columbians aren't holding 
up their end of the <b>social-licence</b> bargain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is where federal NDP
 leader Jagmeet Singh should have a useful intervention to make, given 
it's his provincial family on opposite sides of the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> dispute. But Singh has sided with B.C. and its brighter federal electoral prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government can, and should, re-assert its constitutional right to build the <b>pipeline</b>. And yes, the feds can join Alberta in slapping down money and insurance guarantees. But that's only half the battle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the communities along the <b>pipeline</b>
 route remain ready to obstruct its construction, it's going to take a 
lot more than bucks and words to clear the way. Even the stern words of a
 judge urging protesters out of the way might not do the trick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What then? Do the sunny ways of Trudeau allow for a hint of the army steel flashed by his father? Do we just watch him?</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When
 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hosted a confab in Ottawa on Sunday 
between our NDP Premier Rachel Notley and B.C.'s NDP Premier John 
Horgan, the only concrete result was an Ottawa-Alberta alliance to throw
 taxpayer money at a project that wouldn't need subsidies if these three
 governments'environmentalism hadn't scared away all private investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, sure, after the 
meeting Trudeau also promised to introduce legislation soon that would 
"reassert and reinforce" Ottawa's constitutional authority to ensure the
 Trans Mountain expansion project gets built. Whoop-de-do. This is about
 as necessary as the feds passing a law reaffirming their constitutional
 authority over the issuing of coins and currency, the post office, the 
census and "beacons, buoys, lighthouses and Sable Island."</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key development from Sunday's <b>pipeline</b> summit was the willingness of the Trudeau and Notley governments to put our money where their mouths are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Notley 
government, this reminds me of their mess-up over their Climate 
Leadership Plan and PPAs (power purchase agreements).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When our NDP brought in their Climate Leadership Plan in 2015, they failed to consider the effect on PPAs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large-scale buyers of 
power had long-term contracts with the provincial electricity balancing 
pool that permitted them to cancel those contracts if the government 
took action that made the contracts unprofitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley's climate plan 
imposed huge new taxes on large-scale emitters. That made the PPAs 
unprofitable, resulting in the cancellation of many. That NDP failure 
cost Alberta taxpayers at least $2 billion, and likely more than $3 
billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now we can see the failure of the Notley NDP's "<b>social licence</b>" experiment to get pipelines built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta NDP have 
beggared our economy and overburdened our oil and gas industry with 
regulations and taxes, all in the name of convincing "green" activists 
to stop blocking our pipelines. Instead, the NDP's drumbeat on climate 
change, sustainable development and alternate energies has merely 
emboldened activists to hold out longer against new pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sunday, we saw clearly
 where this latest NDP failure has led us - to a joint deal with Trudeau
 and his government to pump perhaps billions of tax dollars into saving <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s <b>pipeline</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But remember this key 
fact: the Trans Mountain expansion project is economically viable. 
Pipelines are being built elsewhere around the world even at current oil
 prices. Trans Mountain doesn't need subsidies to make it profitable. It
 needs subsidies only because of political failures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However much of our money Trudeau and Notley throw at <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> is being thrown at the project only because both the feds and the province failed politically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their carbon taxes and 
added environmental regulations, their pandering to eco-activists and 
Indigenous politicians hasn't worked. So now we taxpayers are going to 
have to fork over billions to save the Liberals'and New 
Democrats'political skins, as well as to save a <b>pipeline</b> project that didn't need help in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the sequel to the NDP and the PPAs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta NDP cling to 
the fainter-than-faint hope that if they can keep Trans Mountain going, 
they might sneak a second term next year. So they are prepared to raid 
the Heritage Fund or run an even larger deficit to hand a couple billion
 dollars they don't have over to <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the federal 
Liberals are worried for the first time that they might not win 
re-election next year. They don't care about winning votes in Alberta, 
but they realize they have to show concrete action on Trans Mountain or 
risk alienating Ontario voters, who actually care about a prosperous 
economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Make no mistake, though, all this is is a subsidy from taxpayers to the shareholders of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> just to save the NDP's and Liberals'political hides.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The PM, who once campaigned on a more collaborative approach to federalism, says "the <b>pipeline</b> will get built."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So just what is on the table?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some of the 
choices that a range of experts inside and outside government, most of

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Legal and regulatory</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government could 
enact a new bill - call it, say, the Trans-Mountain Act - to clearly 
define and assert federal jurisdiction on the project and hobble the 
B.C. NDP's planned reference to a B.C. court on the question of its 
jurisdiction. The federal government could take over permitting and 
other regulatory approvals for the project. It could clarify its own 
powers and add other burdens or outline penalties for the province if it
 tries to stand in the way of the <b>pipeline</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa could withhold 
discretionary funds from B.C. such as spending on regional economic 
diversification, innovation or other monies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government 
could, counterintuitively, require further environmental controls on the
 project, say double-walled pipelines or increased marine protections to
 further address Indigenous and environmental concerns - beyond the 
$1.5-billion oceans protection plan it already promised to address the 
previous B.C. Liberal government's concerns - in exchange for some kind 
of guarantee the B.C. government would cease its opposition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In theory, Ottawa could 
disallow a B.C. law or regulation that it declares as contrary to the 
national interest, but that kind of sledgehammer hasn't been used since 
the 1940s, and legal experts say convention suggests it should not be 
used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa could, however, 
invoke federal emergency powers to deal with protests if they were to 
block construction. However the RCMP already has lawful powers to 
enforce a B.C. court-ordered injunction against protests within five 
metres of two work sites, and last month arrested dozens of protesters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal sources dismiss 
talk of calling in the military. "None of this uncertainty is about 
protests," said one official. Rather, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s
 uncertainty centres on B.C.'s vow to put legal hurdles in the way of 
the project. "It's making investors skittish," the official said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finance Minister Bill 
Morneau said the government is looking to "de-risk the project so that 
it goes forward." In plain language, that means underwrite or assume 
some of the project's risk in some way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Tim McMillan, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum 
Producers, said "there are a 1,000 permutations" of what financial 
backstop could look like. Others inside government agree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government 
and/or the Alberta government could buy a partial or even a controlling 
stake (a highly unlikely, but not off-the-table option) in a project 
that is 30 per cent held by <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada Limited</span> and 70 per cent owned by Texas-based <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan, Inc</span>., one of North America's largest <b>pipeline</b> operators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upside: it would 
assure investors Canada is prepared to put its money where its mouth is 
to push the project through. The downside: the prospect of Justin 
Trudeau buying into an oilsands <b>pipeline</b> company would surely run counter to his stance on climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa could provide some
 kind of financial guarantee to backstop or insure any part of the 
project, such as construction costs, on a look-back or a go-forward 
basis - a kind of insurance policy for the $1.1-billion <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 has already spent or against future spending on a project estimated to 
cost $7.4 billion. Right now, because the project is not 
full-steam-ahead, construction costs are estimated at about $20 million a
 month, but if the green light is given to start large-scale 
construction, that is expected to run as high as $200 million to $300 
million a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa's options could 
include a loan guarantee. It could loan money and collect interest or 
forgo interest in exchange for equity knowing the return on the 
investment is secure. <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> has
 secured commitments from 13 of Western Canada's largest oil producers 
that they will ship heavy and light crude through the <b>pipeline</b> once its capacity is tripled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> won't say publicly what 
action it wants Ottawa to take, or whether it even wants the government 
to take an equity stake. The company won't comment on Sunday's summit in
 Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement to the Star, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 said it will continue to consult "with various stakeholders" to see if 
an agreement can be reached by June. "The focus in those consultations 
will be on two principles: clarity on the path forward, particularly 
with respect to the ability to construct through B.C.; and, adequate 
protection of KML shareholders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be clear, Ottawa has already narrowed the range of "options" it is prepared to take.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morneau dismissed outright B.C.'s request that Ottawa ask the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>
 to decide whether the province has any environmental or marine 
protection jurisdiction that would allow it to put new controls on oil 
flows in the proposed expansion of the Alberta-B. C. <b>pipeline</b>, in the name of defending B.C.'s coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't see a need to refer something to the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>
 when we already know that it's a federal jurisdiction," said the 
finance minister. "That from our standpoint is not a course of action 
that makes sense."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span> reference wouldn't solve anything by May 31 in any case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And for Justin Trudeau to
 claim success, let alone carry the banner of being a different kind of 
national leader - different than the polarizing figure that his father 
was - the answer would seem to lie in a political agreement to resolve 
differences, in the spirit of co-operative federalism, not in a 
judicially imposed resolution.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the nation mourning Humboldt's loss, pecking out an obstinate tweet about an oil <b>pipeline</b>
 buried in political grief wasn't at the top of Justin Trudeau's to-do 
list. Yet the prime minister tweeted it out before joining members of 
the shattered prairie community for last Sunday's vigil.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome
 to government, where events never pause and most days are an endless 
series of bad and worse choices. Trudeau is certainly down to bad and 
worse on the question of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s crown jewel, which happens to double as his fig-leaf on oil and gas policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau the green carbontaxer might really, really (really) want this singular <b>pipeline</b>
 built, but if the company building it is now wavering, and the Green 
party dependent NDP premier of the province through which it must pass 
hasn't yet found a body he won't chuck in front of it, at what point do 
you call a spade no spade and concede the Earth will not be moving? 
Perhaps fearing for its economic and constitutional credibility, the 
answer from Team Trudeau is a ringing "not now, not ever."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are determined to see
 (Trans Mountain) built," Trudeau has told reporters. "It is in the 
national interest. It doesn't make any sense for us to continue to have a
 $15-billion discount on our oil resources because we are trapped with 
an American market. We need to get our resources to new markets." 
Indeed. The same words could have - and did - come out of Stephen 
Harper's mouth. Trudeau now has to bell the cat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't meant to be this way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harper's confrontational "cramthem-down-your-throats" <b>pipeline</b> policy was to be replaced with Trudeau's more charismatic approach that would accrue the "<b>social licence</b>"
 needed to grease construction, a canard that happens to be, despite the
 environmental hysteria, the only fauna killed to date along the <b>pipeline</b>'s route.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To frame the debate as proeconomy versus pro-environment is to miss the point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Trans Mountain 
ultimately proves is the past 20 years of debate in Canada has split 
people into two irreconcilable camps: pro-oil and anti-oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preening at climate 
summits and taxing carbon won't make exporting oil kosher to those who 
are resolutely opposed. Over their dead bodies is the message being 
passed to Trudeau at the minute. It's not a question of law, it's a 
matter of will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Giddy though the 
opposition parties might be, now is not the time for them to revel in 
Trudeau's mire. Seeing your opponent hoist with his own petard is 
satisfying, but if the <b>pipeline</b> really is in Canada's national 
interest - and it is - the opposition should offer some constructive 
suggestions along with any withering scorn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the rather shouty and petty state of modern politics, this won't happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The partisan urge to 
nannynanny-boo-boo is too strong and besides, Conservatives will say, 
the Liberals didn't exactly lift a finger of support in opposition 
before assuming office and turning the matter into a constitutional 
crisis. Further disincentivizing bipartisan efforts is the Trudeau 
carbon tax, a big part of the government's <b>social licence</b> play that is not particularly well-read by any capital-C Conservative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here, Trudeau shoulders a
 good chunk of the blame. For all his talk of kumbaya, Trudeau's Pan 
Canadian Framework for Clean Energy and Climate Change - with its plan 
for carbon "pricing" - was effectively crammed down provincial throats. 
And with Rachel Notley and Kathleen Wynne's governments now in severe 
financial distress, voters there and across Canada will surely begin to 
wonder why the hell they're on the road to higher taxes if those uppity 
British Columbians aren't holding up their end of the <b>social-licence</b> bargain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is where federal NDP
 leader Jagmeet Singh should have a useful intervention to make, given 
it's his provincial brethren on opposite sides of the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 dispute. But to hope for substance from Singh is to wish for unicorns. 
Singh has done the easy thing and sided with B.C. and its brighter 
federal electoral prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where does this leave Trans Mountain? Shorn of friends and solutions, but all is not yet lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government can, and should, re-assert its constitutional right to build the <b>pipeline</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yes, the feds can join Alberta in slapping down money and insurance guarantees. But that's only half the battle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the communities along the <b>pipeline</b>
 route remain ready to obstruct its construction it's going to take a 
lot more than bucks and words to clear the way. Even the stern words of a
 judge urging protesters out of the way might not do the trick. What 
then? Do the sunny ways of Trudeau the son even allow for a hint of the 
army steel flashed by his father? Do we just ... watch him? Andrew 
MacDougall is a Londonbased communications consultant and ex-director of

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government is still 
examining its options, Carr said, but won't commit to a course of action
 before Sunday, when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau jets home from Peru 
for a hastily organized meeting in Ottawa with British Columbia Premier 
John Horgan and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley.</p>

 we're now faced with is to find ways to make sure there is more 
certainty than there is now," Carr said in an interview with the <span class="companylink">Canadian Press</span>.
 "One of the ways to make sure there is more certainty is to look at 
possible financial arrangements that would help de-risk the project."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Pipeline</b> builder 
Kinder Morgan has halted all non-essential spending on the project until
 it gets assurances from Ottawa that the issues will be resolved. The 
federal government has until May 31 to respond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau has put a lot of 
political eggs in the Trans Mountain basket, risking political capital 
among climate-change activists in search of middle ground that allows 
for <b>pipeline</b> construction alongside improved <span class="companylink">environmental safeguards</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau, who is currently
 in Peru for the Summit of the Americas, was originally supposed to fly 
to Paris directly from Lima on Sunday for meetings with French President
 Emmanuel Macron. Instead, he'll be back in the national capital in 
search of a resolution to an intractable - and politically perilous - 
dispute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carr refused to discuss 
the specific financial options available, other than to say there are 
many of them on the table and they're all being considered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of those options, however, is to buy a stake in the <b>pipeline</b>, something Notley has already said Alberta would be willing to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada and Alberta could jointly buy the <b>pipeline</b> outright, or at least a significant stake in the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another option is to provide a guaranteed source of revenue for private investors if the <b>pipeline</b> completion date misses the target for when returns on their investments were supposed to start flowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company had targeted May 31 as the make-or-break deadline to start construction if the <b>pipeline</b> was to hit those investment targets. That date is now the drop-dead date <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> has given Canada to prove the company should have the confidence to move forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Political strategist 
Robin Sears, a principal at Earnscliffe Strategy Group, said another 
option would be to increase spending on the environmental protection 
side, including on improved research into preventing and mitigating the 
impacts of a diluted bitumen spill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The company has not done
 what it needs to have done to satisfy the people of B.C. they have 
taken the steps necessary to protect the environment," said <span class="companylink">Sears</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sears said the Trudeau 
government has an oceans-protection plan on paper, but hasn't done much 
if anything to put it into action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carr was only prepared to
 say Sunday's meeting between Trudeau and the premiers would be a chance
 for the various sides to share their positions and try to talk things 
out - not necessarily a day when further action would be announced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, said <span class="companylink">Sears</span>, would be a bad political move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If they come out of that
 meeting on Sunday and [Trudeau] says, 'We've made good progress and I'm
 off to Paris,'it will cost them severely," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">University of British 
Columbia politics professor Kathryn Harrison said she doesn't know that 
there is a way for everyone to come out of Sunday's meeting with a win. 
"They have drawn lines in the sand that are simply incompatible," said 
Harrison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau and Carr have 
spent more than two years accusing the former Conservative government of
 themselves failing to build pipelines because they stacked the deck 
against environmental concerns, failing in the process to get the <b>social licence</b> necessary to allow the projects to proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals introduced 
new review processes that accounted for things like the potential 
greenhouse gas emissions resulting from increased oil flows. The <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>'s 2016 approval of Trans Mountain required monitoring and upstream emissions offsets related to construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But environmental 
concerns remain - including the risk of higher emissions from increased 
oilsands production and the environmental impact of a spill. As a 
result, environmentalists who helped get Trudeau elected are now 
doubting his commitment to the cause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harrison said Trudeau has staked a claim on being able to reconcile both interests, offering up the <b>pipeline</b>
 - and the resulting ability to get resources to market - as a quid pro 
quo to get provincial and stakeholder support for a carbon price and 
environmental investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That was the compromise 
and they got pretty far with it," Harrison said, noting all provinces 
but Saskatchewan signed onto the climate-change framework.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're at that point now 
where the trains are colliding. This is a moment of truth for Canada and
 a country that relies heavily on producing fossil fuels."</p>

remember them in our hearts. But, Craig, you said to me you've never 
have worn a hockey jersey before, and that goes back to something you 
saw back when you were in the audience in nineteen what?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CRAIG OLIVER (<span class="companylink">CTV</span>
 News): This is a 1920 jersey from the Winnipeg Falcons, and they went 
to Antwerp, Germany, and they won a gold medal in the Olympics, and I'm 
happy to be representing Winnipeg and the Falcons because I spent many 
happy years living in that great city. MARTIN: Yes. And you?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAURA STONE (Globe and Mail): This is from the women's worlds that was held here in Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: All right, Robin 
Hinton, thank you over there behind that camera, she surprised us with 
these. This of course is a Canadian jersey. All right, I want to talk a 
little bit about this Trudeau u-turn. He gets on the plane. The 
reporters have already done their rants, and then they sort of hand out a
 notice on the plane that says, oops, we're coming back in three days. 
Laura, what do you make of that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STONE: Well I think he had to do it, right. I mean he's facing so much pressure from all sides to say something about the <b>pipeline</b>.
 He couldn't leave on an eight-day trip without addressing this major 
crisis which is going on in his own country, so I think he made the 
right move by doing that. I don't understand why it was slapped together
 at the last minute like that but, you know, I think that it's going to 
be, it's a one-day meeting, right. We don't know what's going to come 
out of it. Are they going to have anything to announce at the end of it,
 or is it going to be similar to that cabinet meeting that we saw on 
Parliament Hill where everyone kind of scurried away and then he's off 
again to France. So it depends what comes out of the meeting, and what 
mood the premiers are in after it that really determines the course of 
this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: That's the 
problem, isn't it, Craig. If he comes back, does this whole thing and 
comes out and goes all options are on the table, you're going to go 
what?! OLIVER: Look, this is a watershed event. And for Trudeau, it's a 
leadership moment. I think he has to decide whether this is his just 
watch me moment, or whether it is just let's wait a while and see what 
happens moment. I don't think he can let it be that. He's got to be full
 in now. He's said this <b>pipeline</b> is going to happen. He said the 
federal government has total jurisdiction. And he has made this a 
commitment, and his government is fully invested in it, so I think he's 
got to do something bold and determined, and force the issue here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: I'm sorry but my imagination doesn't see a way to do that with John Horgan sitting at the table. Where's the win-win?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: Well I think what
 he could, so what is he going to say sitting there with Horgan and the 
BC premier? I think it will be about money. I think he's going to say, 
and I don't know, by the way, so this is a guess. He and the premier are
 going to say, look, we're going to have to buy a piece of this 
operation or we're going to have to put money into it in one way or 
another, or they might even have to buy the whole thing, but it's going 
to happen. And if Canadians are putting money into it, and you are not, 
number one, you're not going to get anything back out of it. And second,
 if BC continues to try to slow this operation down, we'll cut transfer 
payments of various kinds to you to punish the province for costing 
Canadian taxpayers a lot of money. I think that would be fairly 
persuasive, because I think what Horgan needs now is a way out. He needs
 a face-saving way to back off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STONE: I just, I can't 
see at this moment the prime minister threatening British Columbia like 
that. Craig, you have a different view of that. You've been around a 
little bit longer than me so maybe you know. But I just, you know, 
Trudeau has painted himself as the guy who can bring everyone together, 
right, that's been his brand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: <b>Social licence</b> thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STONE: Yeah, exactly. So I think he already has the upper hand in this situation in terms of jurisdiction of who can build the <b>pipeline</b>. Maybe Horgan won't be happy about it, but I think money in terms of putting money into the <b>pipeline</b> and giving <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 reassurances that if there's any protests or delays that the government
 will back them on that, but I don't know if he'll go so far as actually
 punishing British Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: See if they do, 
Craig, it would seem to me that just ignites the protest. That you'll 
see bus after bus hauling away protestors in handcuffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: Well they're 
going to be there anyway. The other thing he can do, I mean there are 
lots of nuclear options here. One of them is the public, what's it 
called, the public...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Emergency's act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STONE: The emergency act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: Yeah, emergency 
act, anyway, which gives them tremendous power to act against British 
Columbia. After all, if they're going to win this battle, they're going 
to have to do things a lot of British Columbians don't like. But there's
 still a small majority of British Columbians who want this <b>pipeline</b>
 to happen. The problem is they've never really had a champion, and 
that's very difficult to come up against a green party and the NDP 
leader. MARTIN: Laura, I want to bring in your story this week, it was 
kind of fun, Kevin O'Leary, you went down to watch this fundraiser, and 
now it seems like the Liberals didn't like what he's doing for 
fundraising, and it's very frustrating for him isn't it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STONE: Yes. Kevin O'Leary
 is now one of my beats. I cover him regularly. Yeah, I mean, the 
Liberals are just loving this, right. Kevin O'Leary held this big 
fundraiser in Toronto last week. He brought in Mark Cuben and another 
one of his...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: This is because he didn't pay off his debts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STONE: Because he racked 
up a huge amount of debt during the Conservative leadership race that he
 eventually dropped out of before the finish. But now he's got $530,000 
in debt. He's got to raise all this money, and there's a limit on how 
much people can donate, and he cannot pay it off himself. So the 
Liberals have written to <span class="companylink">Elections Canada</span>
 asking them to look into this because as part of his pitch for this 
fundraiser, he promised to match charitable donations, somehow rope the 
federal government into this, so everyone is all in an uproar. It 
appears from the law, though, that the same rules for contributions 
don't apply after the leadership contest, so we'll see what <span class="companylink">Elections Canada</span>
 says about that. But the point is this guy is going to have to hold a 
lot of fundraisers in the next few months in smaller places than Toronto
 because he didn't raise enough money, and he's not going to be able to 
charge $2,000 for a ticket anymore because people aren't going to pay 
it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Even to see Kevin O'Leary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STONE: Even to see Kevin 
O'Leary. So he's in a bit of a pickle here. He's got to be touring 
around again. He can't get rid of this thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: I think O'Leary ran a mean-spirited, incompetent campaign. MARTIN: What do you really think, Craig?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: But I have to say
 this. At least there's something admirable in trying to pay off many 
people who aren't big companies, who he probably over hired to get his 
campaign rolling, and so you got to say, yeah, he's doing the right 
thing to try to pay them off. STONE: Yeah. He said he'll pay off the 
smaller vendors first because he does feel sorry for the ma and pa 
shops. But he also racked up $150,000 in personal expenses flying around
 on private jets so he was a bit reckless, you could say, in how he ran 
his campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: Can I just say it's the Public Orders Emergency Act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: All right, Craig 
and Laura, thanks for everything. We'll see you next week. Coming up, 
the last word tries to explain Alberta's anger. Please stay with us.</p>

 recent poll showing that a majority of Canadians don't understand or 
have never heard of a carbon tax demonstrates the gulf between the 
largely academic-bureaucratic elite who push for this tax and ordinary 
Canadians. For nearly three years, pro-carbon-tax governments and 
groups, such as the EcoFiscal Commission, which released last week's 
poll, have controlled the commanding heights of this debate with funding
 and media support the fossil fuel lobby can only dream of. They have 
nevertheless failed to parlay these huge advantages into public 
understanding and support.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 reasons the public has not rallied behind a carbon tax are clear 
enough. Promises that the carbon tax would be revenue neutral were 
quickly forgotten, revealing it as just another tax grab( 
http://business.financialpost.com/opinion/jack-mintz-carbon-pricing-has-been-fully-exposed-as-just-another-tax-grab[http://business.financialpost.com/opinion/jack-mintz-carbon-pricing-has-been-fully-exposed-as-just-another-tax-grab]
 ) that offended people on the right. Their promised aim of reducing 
emissions has ended up coming up short because the carbon levies, where 
they were applied, were not enough to materially change consumption when
 crude oil prices were falling, disillusioning people on the left. 
Carbon taxes also failed on the claim they would bridge the gap between 
the environment and the economy by creating the <b>social licence</b> to build a <b>pipeline</b>.
 In Canada, the final nail in their coffin was the election of a U.S. 
administration uninterested in an American carbon tax (or any costly 
climate measures) automatically putting Canadian industries at a 
competitive disadvantage with higher energy costs but no prospect of 
lower global emissions, making the whole exercise both costly and 
pointless.</p>

 )</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Academic initiatives such
 as the EcoFiscal Commission and the like-minded Sustainable Prosperity 
Institute operate in an echo chamber where the converted preach to the 
converted rather than connecting with the general population. 
Presumably, the hope was that if enough academics and government 
officials signed on to a carbon tax the public would somehow internalize
 it via osmosis. Instead, opponents to a carbon tax are poised to soon 
take power in Alberta, Ontario and, based on the latest polling, 
possibly federally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal Liberal and 
the Alberta NDP governments plainly deserve the blame for failing to 
deliver on their promise that a carbon tax would buy <b>social licence</b> for <b>pipeline</b>
 construction, with the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain expansion just the 
latest casualty (after the cancellation of Energy East and Northern 
Gateway). They naively argued the environmental fringe could be reasoned
 with, ignoring that professional eco-warriors are possessed by what 
conservative sociologist Peter Berger called "mob psychology, the 
mystique of the street, the rage against all institutions of liberal 
democracy, and, last but not least, the militant anti-reason impervious 
to argument." Say what you want about U.S. President Donald Trump, but 
he quickly and peacefully ended the raucous protests against the North 
Dakota Access <b>pipeline</b> by showing he was implacably committed to 
building it, thus dissuading opponents from thinking their protests 
would produce the sort of dithering response they knew to expect from 
the governments of Justin Trudeau and Barack Obama. Four months after 
Trump took office, oil was flowing through the North Dakota <b>pipeline</b>, a visible demonstration to international investors of the difference in leadership between Canada and the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campaign for the 
carbon tax bears a close resemblance to that for the GST. While 
value-added sales taxes like the GST are universally beloved by 
economists and bureaucrats as more efficient than income taxes, elites 
have never been able to convince the general population that a sales tax
 is either efficient or fair. Implementing the GST helped to nearly wipe
 out the federal Progressive Conservative party in the 1993 election. 
Stephen Harper won his first election for the reinvented Conservative 
party by promising to lower the hated GST, something he carried through 
despite the strenuous objections of Finance Department bureaucrats. As 
recently as 2011, voters in B.C. refused in a referendum to harmonize 
with the GST, while Albertans remain militantly opposed to any type of 
sales tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Popular resistance to tax
 reform erupted again last summer in response to the overhaul of 
small-business taxes proposed by Finance Minister Bill Morneau. The plan
 was another arcane academic exercise, backed by the <span class="companylink">University of Ottawa</span>'s
 Michael Wolfson. Devising a tax scheme that seemed optimal in principle
 ignored the reality of how the tax would actually affect small 
businesses and farmers, a perfect example of what author Nassim Taleb 
calls the "Intellectual Yet Idiot" phenomenon in his newest book, Skin 
in the Game. Taleb notes that one of the distinct features of this type 
of advice is its complete separation from any consequences. Academics 
freely counsel naïve politicians, but when the plan meets opposition, 
politicians alone face the consequences in the court of public opinion -
 while their scholarly advisors quickly scurry back to their research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 20th century saw 
democracy advance as a result of the increased willingness of the public
 to question the divine right of elites to dictate how our society is 
run. A sea change occurred after the First World War, when the mindless 
slaughter of millions of ordinary soldiers in the trenches of Europe 
made irresistible the working class's demand for broader voting rights. 
As suffrage became more universal, elites have worried incessantly about
 so-called mob rule. Taleb wryly observes that when the population votes
 in a way condoned by the elite, it is approvingly called democracy in 
action; when they vote differently, the ominous spectre of populism is 
raised, never more so than after the election of Donald Trump. That same
 hypocrisy is clearly evident in the debate surrounding a carbon tax. 
The enlightened economists and politicians insist that any opposition to
 taxing carbon is Neanderthal, climate-denying populism. Yet obstructing
 the <b>pipeline</b> it was supposed to facilitate is somehow socially responsible and so it goes unsanctioned.</p>

jump out of the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Justin Trudeau, the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b>
 expansion train has been bearing down on him and his government for 
close to a year, yet it has been allowed to become a crisis worthy of an
 extraordinary cabinet meeting and an interprovincial fight that should 
concern all Canadians.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For
 all the prime minister's talk about how the economy and the environment
 go hand-in-hand, sometimes they become detached and action is needed, 
not a continuation of a Goldilocks not-too-hot, not-too-cold mantra that
 works as a sound bite, but not always as policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau has allowed 
himself to be held hostage by a Texas-based energy corporation so tone 
deaf it issued an ultimatum on the project as this nation was mourning 
the Humboldt Broncos tragedy in Saskatchewan, and a rookie premier who 
signalled a year ago he would do exactly what he is doing today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
John Horgan is defending the British Columbia coast against increased 
tanker traffic, and whether or not one believes he has the right to hold
 up a project Trudeau has declared to be in the "national interest," he 
is doing precisely what he promised he would do if elected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Immediately after his election, there was rampant speculation that he would try to run out the clock to make the entire <b>pipeline</b> twinning project unpalatable to <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So here we are, a 
defining moment for the Trudeau government, with the clock ticking; a 
defining moment which Trudeau has largely brought upon himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau watched as Horgan and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley ratcheted up a trade war, and <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 should not have shocked anyone when it finally decided it couldn't 
continue to pour money into a project that has been continually stalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals, having already killed the Northern Gateway <b>pipeline</b>, watched Energy East die and their grand bargain with Notley rested with the Trans Mountain project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau needed Notley and her environmental initiative to sell his national climate change plan. Notley needed a <b>pipeline</b> win as her quid pro quo, a lifeline which could win her re-election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That grand plan is 
falling apart. With Jason Kenney waiting in the wings in Alberta, and 
Doug Ford looking covetously at Queen's Park, that national plan faces 
further peril.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is important to 
remember how a campaigning Trudeau promised to deal with pipelines and 
other resource development compared to where he stood Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On "<b>social licence</b>," the Liberal platform read: "While governments grant permits for resource development, only communities can grant permission."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was modified a year 
into the mandate with a more broad definition that dealt with 
consultation and dropped any reference to permission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, from the 2015 
platform was a promise to Indigenous Canadians that they would be full 
partners on resource projects: "This will ensure on project reviews and 
assessments, the Crown is fully executing its consultation, 
accommodation and consent obligations, in accordance with its 
constitutional and international human rights obligations, including 
Aboriginal and treaty rights and the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conservative 
opposition does itself no favours as it takes aim at Trudeau. 
Conservative MPs have been hit by a collective amnesia that makes them 
forget 10 years of Stephen Harper championing various pipelines 
accomplished nothing more than irritating official Washington and an 
infamous Harper declaration that Obama's approval of the Keystone XL <b>pipeline</b>, was a "no-brainer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Harper OK'd the Northern Gateway <b>pipeline</b>,
 no one from his government would stand in front of a camera to back the
 decision. It was left to wither until Trudeau mercifully killed it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With two NDP governments 
at war, federal leader Jagmeet Singh has effectively gone to ground, 
refusing to stand up to Notley or Horgan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau's tool box 
remains more formidable than Horgan's and federal action should win the 
day. This is a federal project that can't be held up by a province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to get there, Trudeau is going to have to force an unpopular <b>pipeline</b> expansion by bulldozing it past a provincial government, Indigenous leaders and protesters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau will expend much more than political capital. He will have his green bona fides shattered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he still might end up having to deal with Kenney and Ford in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A plan that looked so sound on paper has fallen apart on the ground.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the phrase 
coined by American psychologist Dan Kiley in his 1983 international 
bestseller of the same name, referring to childlike men who refuse to 
grow up and accept adult responsibilities.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We saw it in his absurd 
suggestions during the 2015 election campaign that Alberta's oil sands, 
and Canada's entire oil and gas industry, were nothing more than 
temporary evils.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That Canada under Trudeau
 world earn the world's praise by painlessly transitioning our 
resourcebased economy to green energy, laughing all the way to the bank 
in the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such foolish boasts were examples of Peter Pan Syndrome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were best summed up 
in 2012 by Trudeau's good friend and current top political advisor, 
Gerald Butts, who said as the then head of the <span class="companylink">World Wildlife Fund Canada</span>: "We don't think there ought to be a carbon-based energy industry by the middle of this century."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suggesting Canada should 
abandon fossil fuels by 2050 revealed a staggering misunderstanding of 
Canadian and global energy needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy that can't be 
supplied by wind turbines and solar panels because, unlike fossil fuels,
 the power they provide is intermittent. It can't be stored for use when
 needed, nor is it economically feasible, given current technologies, 
without massive subsidies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bitter fruit of 
Trudeau's half-baked ideas about energy are seen today as the PM heads 
off for Peru while his cabinet ministers run away from reporters asking 
what the federal government plans to do to get the stalled Trans 
Mountain <b>pipeline</b> built, a project it says it supports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They resemble deer frozen in the headlights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're caught between Trudeau's election pandering to anti-<b>pipeline</b>
 protesters in B.C. and across Canada, and the reality our energy sector
 provides hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country, although not
 for much longer if we can't get our landlocked oil and gas resources to
 global markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As things stand, B.C.'s 
NDP Premier John Horgan vows to stop Alberta from shipping its oil to 
the Pacific coast through the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b> for export,
 while Alberta's NDP Premier Rachel Notley threatens financial 
retaliation against B.C. and urges Trudeau to do the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Texas-based Kimber Morgan, tired of procedural delays on its $7.4-billion project, has suspended none-essential work on its <b>pipeline</b> with a deadline of May 31 to resolve the impasse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, federal 
Environment Minister Catherine McKenna assures Canadians the billions of
 dollars we're paying under Trudeau's national carbon pricing scheme - 
which was supposed to give him the "<b>social licence</b>" to approve 
pipelines - will achieve our United Nations commitments to meet our 
industrial greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in 2030. Except 
anyone who can add thinks that's impossible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this while federal 
Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr assures Canadians the Trudeau 
government is considering all options to get the stalled <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> <b>pipeline</b> going, while refusing to discuss them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They include everything 
from a constitutional challenge of B.C.'s delaying tactics, to a Supreme
 Court reference, to paying B.C. to withdraw its objections, to Ottawa 
and Alberta investing in the <b>pipeline</b> to reassure investors, to sending in the army to remove protesters.</p>

 is a government for? Forget bickering over who's a big meanie for not 
wanting to pluck a thick wad from its magic money tree for some 
unfortunate group. If a <b>pipeline</b> can't be built because a 
province and some disgruntled people mock the law, we have to ask, 
fundamentally, what is a government for? When <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada</span>
 declined to put billions more shareholders'dollars at risk on a project
 whose legal approval did not mean it could legally be built, Maude 
Barlow gloattweeted, "Huge good news! <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> suspending all non essential spending on Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b>!!!
 Resistance matters!" Resistance? Resistance to what? The issue here is 
not pipelines or even fossil fuels. It's the rule of law. You're against
 that? Of course not all laws are just. If they were, nobody would ever 
go about campaigning to change them.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
 But the constant quest to improve both our legislation and our 
political system by holding up current manmade laws against the eternal 
standard of natural law does not begin to justify a "smash and grab" 
approach to public policy, where people act as though everything they 
dislike must secretly be illegal so they get to trespass, shout down 
speakers, break windows or obstruct legally authorized pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you live under 
tyranny, you're entitled to resist by whatever mix of force and fraud 
seems prudent. But Canada is not a tyranny, and to engage in lawbreaking
 when a decision here doesn't go your way is petty, narcissistic and 
incipiently tyrannical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I grant that the Trudeau 
administration, like a surprising number of conservative politicians and
 even oil companies, have dug a deep hole by trying to confer "<b>social licence</b>"
 on pipelines by saying the stuff they transport is destroying the 
planet. But that argument should make it easy to forbid them legally. If
 instead you insist that bubble zones around abortion clinics be 
enforced while trespassing to obstruct pipelines, we're just going to 
end up trading blows not because democracy failed us, but because we 
failed it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't like the current <b>pipeline</b> approval process either. But the <span class="companylink">Parliament of Canada</span>
 clearly has the power to set and enforce it under Constitutional 
clauses including S91 generally, S92.2 particularly and S92.10.c. To get
 boringly technical, nothing in S92A or elsewhere lets provinces use 
their legitimate powers as a cloak for usurping federal jurisdiction; 
there's a firm legal maxim that you cannot do indirectly what you are 
forbidden to do directly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OK, it's not boringly 
technical. It gets to the heart of the matter. The preamble to our 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms says "Canada is founded upon principles 
that recognize the supremacy of God and the rule of law." If it's no 
longer true, what's left of the Charter, or the government? The Natural 
Resources minister threatened to call the army on lawbreaking <b>pipeline</b> protesters ... in late 2016. We're still waiiiiiiting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a failed oil sands 
tour last week Justin Trudeau told reporters "our job as a government is
 to bring everyone together and say we're all getting what we want..." 
Really? Your job is make-believe? But even if he's the prancing dunce we
 saw in India, are there no adults behind him aware of the extent of the
 crisis and able to find legitimate levers of power and pull them? Or 
are all the levers broken? Alberta Premier Rachel Notley notes 
plaintively that her province has won every court battle over this <b>pipeline</b>.
 But if silly games can stretch judicial proceedings out for years, even
 decades, and ultimately kill their target despite losing every time, 
it's not the rule of law. It's lawlessness in a robe and wig.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is a court system 
for, if winning there means nothing? What is an executive for, if it 
cannot enforce the law? What is a federal government for, if its 
jurisdiction is flouted at will? What is a Constitution for, if the rule
 of law is just an empty phrase? It won't do for provinces to retaliate 
against one another, or the feds against a province, like squabbling 
sovereign fiefdoms. I'm all for decentralization. But some things are 
necessarily national, from defence to internal free trade to criminal 
law, or you have no country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We could end up with 
literally no country if we mock resurgent Alberta separation as just 
gun-totin'hicks with hygiene issues. Why stay in a country whose entire 
system of government appears to have no function beyond 
virtue-signalling? Some think instead its key function is redistributing
 money. I beg to differ. But surely everyone right of Maude Barlow knows
 you can't redistribute non-existent money. And business investment is 
fleeing Canada because we seem to be letting the rule of law slip away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we are, why do we have a government? Indeed, do we have one?</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Milke is the author of multiple studies on the economics of subsidies to business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the great myths 
circulated by the anti-energy crowd in Canada is that the energy sector 
is heavily subsidized by taxpayers. Instead, as I found in my 2017 study
 for the <span class="companylink">Canadian Taxpayers Federation</span>,
 and as economist and taxation expert Jack Mintz has long argued, the 
claims are inflated based on a misuse of tax expenditure data.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But
 if such taxpayer subsidies are rarer than reflexive energy critics 
assert, it turns out that Alberta Premier Rachel Notley and Alberta 
Opposition Leader Jason Kenney are about to give succour to the critics’
 accusations. Over the weekend, both said the Alberta government should 
take a financial stake in <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>, the company facing continual problems in twinning its Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b> from Alberta to its terminus in Burnaby, B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, Ms. Notley said, “If we have to, Alberta is prepared to do whatever it takes to get this <b>pipeline</b> built,” and that included that “Alberta is prepared to be an investor” in the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> project. On Tuesday, she went a step further and declared she would consider buying the <b>pipeline</b>
 outright. Meanwhile, Mr. Kenney argued that while he was 
“philosophically opposed to corporate welfare,” that a “major market 
failure” had occurred. That, he said, justified an equity stake “to 
ensure economic progress.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let’s dissect both 
positions, but start with Mr. Kenney. There is no “major market 
failure.” Instead, there has been major government interference for more
 than a decade in getting Canada’s natural resources – oil, in this case
 – to markets. In the case of British Columbia, consider former premier 
Christy Clark’s 2012 “five conditions” if any new pipelines were to be 
constructed across B.C (this, as if the province was not subject to 
free-trading requirements in Section 92A(2) of the Constitution).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major government 
interference of course continues under the B.C.’s NDP government and the
 City of Burnaby. They are helped along by their anti-resource 
development activist allies on the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lastly, the federal 
government (and despite Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s and Natural 
Resources Minister Jim Carr’s protestations to the contrary) is of 
little help in getting the <b>pipeline</b> built. It is an open secret 
in Calgary that the Trudeau government’s multiple, extra regulatory 
burdens now being imposed on the energy sector mean that even if Trans 
Mountain is built, it will be the last <b>pipeline</b> project, ever. Multiple and multiplying regulatory government thickets are the reason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back to equity stakes: In
 addition to why corporate welfare is always a bad deal for taxpayers 
and a risk even when offered through equity, which often turns into a 
loss, an Alberta government financial stake in <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> would change none of the above dynamics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I’ve never believed Ms. 
Notley was serious in her tactics to force the B.C. government to 
reverse course on its anti-oil position. It is the same with her latest 
threats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, if Alberta’s 
leading politicians want to force the matter, and in a way that has 
impact, here are three immodest proposals: First, Ms. Notley should 
introduce legislation that signals her government will repeal the 
Alberta carbon tax. Absent any B.C. government backdown on the <b>pipeline</b>, and actual federal efforts to the same end, it is overdue to end the charade that Alberta’s carbon tax has enabled so-called <b>social licence</b>. It has not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, Ms. Notley should show up in British Columbia and endorse pro-<b>pipeline</b>
 B.C. Liberal and Skeena MLA Ellis Ross, the opposition critic for 
Natural Gas and Petroleum Resources. Political support for Mr. Ross, a 
former chief councillor for the Haisla Nation, would also force the B.C.
 government to go on the defensive vis-à-vis pro-energy First Nations. 
Ms. Notley’s political endorsement of Mr. Ross and betrayal of her 
same-party colleagues in Victoria is the only way to get their attention
 in a substantive way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last, the federal 
government – which likes carbon taxes and claims the authority to impose
 them on provinces, but also claims it wants Trans Mountain to proceed –
 could demonstrate its fealty to both propositions with a simple 
measure: Add $1 a litre to gasoline prices in British Columbia. One 
suspects $2.50 a litre for gasoline in greater Vancouver and nearly 
similar prices elsewhere in British Columbia would focus minds and 
finally provoke a reaction, and perhaps a B.C. government retreat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike an inadvisable equity stake in <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>,
 those three measures would constitute a serious and necessary 
escalation in this dispute. Anything else by politicians in Alberta or 
Ottawa would be useless theatrics.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a few minutes Monday afternoon, a heavy-hearted peace reigned inside Alberta's legislative assembly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Members of the government
 and Opposition put aside their political differences to pay tribute to 
those killed and injured in the Humboldt Broncos bus crash.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It
 is a safe bet that the name Humboldt Broncos is being uttered in every 
coffee shop, community club, schoolyard and place of worship across 
Alberta, Saskatchewan and beyond because really there is not an Albertan
 who doesn't in some way see themselves and their loved ones in this 
tragedy," said Premier Rachel Notley at the opening of Monday's sitting.
 "I know that I hug my kids tighter, and I'm sure that that goes for a 
lot of us."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">United Conservative Party
 Leader Jason Kenney spoke, as did Alberta Party MLA Rick Fraser, 
Liberal MLA David Swann and Independent MLA Richard Starke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time they were done, such a pall hung over the assembly, you have to think that if Alberta wasn't facing a <b>pipeline</b> crisis, the MLAs would have simply voted to call it a day and go home to hug their kids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> crisis isn't taking a day off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And once the MLAs got into the rhythm of question period after a slow start, they were once again taking shots at each other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Will the premier join 
with me in saying to (Prime Minister) Justin Trudeau that Alberta's 
carbon tax will be repealed unless he gets that <b>pipeline</b> built?" asked Kenney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley's reply: "Cancelling our climate leadership plan here in Alberta is not the path to getting the <b>pipeline</b> built."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so it went. On the surface, Notley and Kenney are at loggerheads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney blames Notley and her "ally" Trudeau for failing to get <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s
 $7.4-billion Trans Mountain expansion built. Notley counters by chiding
 Kenney for being part of a federal Conservative government that over a 
decade never got any pipelines built to tidewater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But scratch the surface and you discover they, on this issue at least, are something like political soulmates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They both decry the tactics of the British Columbia government to chronically delay the <b>pipeline</b>
 even though the federal government has approved it. They are both 
demanding Trudeau take "concrete action" to get the project built. They 
both support the province investing in the <b>pipeline</b> project if necessary to bolster investor confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And they both suggest 
that unless Ottawa uses its constitutional powers to override B.C.'s 
obstreperous tactics, our federal system of government will be seriously
 undermined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are those out 
there who are, at this point, calling this moment that we are in a 
constitutional crisis for the country," Notley said Monday morning at 
the start of a cabinet meeting that journalists were allowed to record. 
"I don't know really if that's too far off."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney was more succinct, as well as more dramatic: "If we can't get this <b>pipeline</b> built, it means that Canada is broken."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <b>pipeline</b> crisis that has <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> on the verge of quitting the project altogether is a mixed blessing for Kenney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the plus side for him,
 it plays to his argument that Notley's Climate Leadership Plan with its
 controversial carbon tax has failed to win the <b>social licence</b> necessary to get the project built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the conventional 
wisdom in Alberta politics the past few years is that conservative 
opposition MLAs were quietly cheering against a <b>pipeline</b> getting built just so the NDP government would be seen as a failure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may have been true a
 year ago, but back then, the Opposition MLAs assumed the project would 
simply get built when they were in government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, it seems we really are in a crisis. Our federal system might really be damaged if not broken.</p>

 John Horgan and his supporters see this as a successful defence of 
B.C.'s right to protect the coastal environment from the risks of a 
catastrophic spill if tanker traffic increased seven-fold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But once the glow of triumph has worn off, what does it mean for the country?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <b>pipeline</b> 
expansion went through the federal government's approval process. And 
while many opponents say the process was deeply flawed, government 
approvals have to mean something if we are to get anything done in 
Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta has a product, but B.C. is saying: "You can't sell it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through a combination of

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The obstacles are being

natural-gas project that also involves a <b>pipeline</b> and tanker port.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How will Alberta, which

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's the answer to <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s
 decision to pause its Trans Mountain expansion project? Well, if you're
 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the answer is spending $280,000 in 
taxpayers'money for a study to tell you why oil investors are backing 
away from Canada. And if you're Alberta Premier Rachel Notley, the 
answer is demanding that Ottawa give a bailout to oilfield workers while
 your government maybe spends billions it doesn't have investing in 
Trans Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If anything, the developments in the last two days prove that not one of the major governments involved in the <b>pipeline</b>
 debate has any clue how jobs are created. And not one of the three - 
the federal Liberals, the Alberta NDP and the B.C. NDP - really, truly 
wants <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> to go ahead. Oh, sure, Premier Notley is doing her finest impersonation of a pro-<b>pipeline</b> politician.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her political future depends on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the energy sector and
 energy workers don't need bailouts and government investment. They need
 our NDP to eliminate its carbon tax, roll back the environmental 
regulations they have introduced and restore the Alberta Advantage. 
Energy-based economies in most of the rest of the world are growing 
strongly without bailouts and government investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Texas and Oklahoma, 
for instance, unemployment is under 4.0 per cent. In North Dakota, it's 
under 3.0. Because there, state governments don't have NDP-like Climate 
Leadership plans that have burdened their energy sectors with billions 
of added taxes and regulations in an effort to buy "<b>social licence</b>."
 The only oil economies that are floundering are those, like Alberta and
 Venezuela, run by lefty governments who think government intervention 
and public spending will spur growth as surely as private innovation and
 investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fastest way to get 
Alberta's economy moving would be for Ottawa, the Alberta NDP and the 
B.C. government of NDP Premier John Horgan to end their obstructionism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And until they do, it's 
doubtful that any amount of federal subsidy or Alberta provincial 
spending can make Trans Mountain go ahead. If the Trudeau government 
ended its new gender-based, Indigenous and ultra-eco assessments of 
energy projects, if it lifted its moratorium on West Coast tanker 
traffic and came out forcefully against B.C.'s delaying tactics and 
against loudmouthed eco-activists, Trans Mountain and other pipelines 
would proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Alberta NDP 
repealed their carbon tax and cancelled their hard cap on oilsands 
emissions and if the B.C. NDP stopped blocking the <b>pipeline</b> at every step, Trans Mountain would go ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s decision is not economic, just as <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s
 decision on Energy East last fall was caused by federal and Quebec 
politics, not the world price of oil. In a conference call with 
investors on Monday morning, Kinder Morgan CEO Steve Kean said something
 that should give Notley, Trudeau and Horgan great pause (but which all 
three will probably ignore).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kean said his company is considering investments in other pipelines elsewhere, just not in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the sticking point is 
not energy economics - those are pretty good again. The hold up is 
Canadian politics. That should chill Canadians to the bone across the 
country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our country has the third
 largest reserves of oil in the world. Yet we are in danger of being 
left behind in an investment ditch because our "green" federal and 
provincial leaders are clambering over one another to be climate change 
Boy Scouts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National economic policy is being determined by the ideas of radicals and environmental groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The international market 
for oil, bitumen and natural gas is strong enough to justify Trans 
Mountain AND Energy East AND Keystone XL, and maybe even Northern 
Gateway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is standing in the way of all of them are "progressive" politicians.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Notley government has spent three years doing everything it can to ruin Alberta's economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has imposed - and then raised - an unwanted carbon tax.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has risked reducing development of the oilsands by imposing a hard cap on emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has raised taxes on 
energy companies, cozied up to the federal Liberals and accelerated the 
shut down of every one of our coal-fired power plants at a tremendous 
cost to Alberta taxpayers and coal communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in the process of paying for this, the NDP are on a path to rack up nearly $100 billion in debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this was done in the name of buying "<b>social licence</b>,"
 the theory that Alberta might win the agreement of the B.C. government 
and environmental activists to build pipelines if we showed a 
willingness to suffer economic pain in the name of saving the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's been all pain and no gain - at least $35 billion in lost investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunday's announcement by <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 that it was suspending any real construction work on its Trans Mountain
 expansion project is proof positive that Rachel Notley's "<b>social licence</b>" is what it has always been - horse droppings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, the premier herself is still drinking the <b>social-licence</b> bathwater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Notley were serious 
about getting pipelines built, at a Sunday news conference she should 
have stepped to the microphone and announced two things: She was 
repealing her government's carbon tax and she was withdrawing Alberta 
from the national climate pact - the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean 
Growth and Climate Change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the name of winning <b>pipeline</b> approvals, Alberta has been beggaring itself. We have been the ones doing ALL of the suffering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's now time for others 
to prove their sincerity to us. Let them seek our co-operation. For 
once, let them show their support for us, rather than Albertans always 
having to be the ones doing the proving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley should have 
suspended her government's carbon tax and ended her co-operation with 
the federal government until others do far more to help. <b>Social licence</b> is getting us nowhere, we should stop spending billions and billions on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But remember, this is the
 same premier who called our province the "embarrassing cousin" of 
Confederation for its environmental record before her. She is the last 
person who is going to back away for her government's disastrous Climate
 Leadership plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If our Peter Pan Prime 
Minister wants Alberta's buy-in on his climate plan and his carbon tax, 
he and his government have to take concrete action to get Trans Mountain
 built, not the other way around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sunday, federal 
Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr called on the B.C. government to 
"end all threats of delay" to Trans Mountain. Ooo, I'll bet that really 
got the NDP government of B.C. Premier John Horgan quaking in their 
loafers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two things: Carr's 
remarks are too little, too late. And how come tough-ish federal 
statements never come from Justin Trudeau? It is not lost on opponents 
of pipelines that Ottawa's tough talk comes from second fiddles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley could also have announced her government was shutting off gasoline shipments to B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If B.C. activists and 
politicians are so concerned about their carbon footprint, we should 
help them by forcing them to abandon their cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But instead of doing any 
of these things, on Sunday Notley called on Ottawa to offer the oil 
industry a bailout and suggested her government might spend even more 
taxpayer billions helping pay for construction of Trans Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She just doesn't get it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the annual meeting 
Friday of the intermediate oilsands producer, CEO Rob Broen faced 
several questions from shareholders, but few about the company's 
day-to-day operations.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead,
 the audience wanted to know about oil pipelines. They asked about 
Ottawa's new review process for major energy projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And they wanted to know about the general state of the sector's competitiveness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If political leaders had a
 chance to listen in, they would have caught a glimpse into the nervous 
psyche of the industry and its investors today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These pipelines need to 
be built ... we need leadership at a federal level to make sure that 
happens," the CEO said in response to one question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Near as aI can tell, we have a tax - we have a carbon tax - but we don't have a <b>pipeline</b> and the opponents of those pipelines are more entrenched than they've ever been.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So the tax hasn't 
helped." Broen isn't the only oilpatch executive voicing concern about 
the industry's future in the face of complex challenges, such as rising 
production in the United States, the differential facing Canadian heavy 
crude and shifting government policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he quickly became one of the more vocal ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with federal 
approval of the Trans Mountain expansion, patience with slow progress on
 pipelines is wearing thin, although it's not entirely clear what more 
the prime minister can do to help propel these projects along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I would tell him he has to show leadership on the <b>pipeline</b> file and it's not just words," Broen said when asked what message he would give Trudeau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He needs to see it 
through to construction and make sure we can see shovels in the ground 
and get it built, for the benefit of all Canadians."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such comments underscore the dilemma facing the federal government today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau can repeat over 
and over until he's blue in the face that the project to the west coast 
will get built. But other pipelines, like Energy East, have failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until all of the court 
challenges are cleared, the protesters in Burnaby go home and Trans 
Mountain is finished - now slated for late 2020 - the industry's 
collective anxiety won't abate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Fort McMurray, Trudeau
 toured Suncor Energy's Fort Hills oilsands project and later met with 
leaders of the largest petroleum producers in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suncor CEO Steve Williams
 said he was encouraged after speaking with the prime minister about 
issues such as market access, competitive pressures facing the sector 
and changes to the regulatory system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think we're going to get some help," Williams told reporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau reiterated his support for <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 and spoke about the "terrible price differential that is sucking $15 
billion out of the Alberta oil industry because we're not getting global
 prices" for Canadian crude.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he linked the federal
 government's national price on carbon and increased spending on marine 
safety to his cabinet granting approval to Trans Mountain and Enbridge's
 Line 3 replacement project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pieces all fit 
together. If one link in the chain falls apart, however, it threatens to
 pull down the entire national climate plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are folks out 
there who really like the idea that we're approving the pipelines ... 
but aren't too sure about the carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are other people 
across the Rockies who really like the idea we're moving forward on 
climate change and bringing in a national price on carbon, but aren't 
too sure about moving forward on a <b>pipeline</b>," he told reporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are standing up for Canadians'interests, as well as getting the <b>social licence</b> to get our resources to market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, it's not only 
pipelines causing heartburn in the oil industry. Leaders are also 
worried about the flight of capital out of the Canadian sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa now appears to be interested in examining the factors reducing investment in the oilpatch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this week, <span class="companylink">Natural Resources Canada</span>
 posted a tender for a $275,000 contract, looking for experts to 
evaluate the competitiveness of the upstream oil and gas sector and 
examine "recent regulatory changes and major market investment drivers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conducting the report 
suggests there is a willingness by Ottawa to take action, although 
Trudeau himself cautioned Canada "shouldn't be part of a race to the 
bottom."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After meeting with the 
oilsands executives Friday, Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr said the
 issue of industry competitiveness was raised by the CEOs during their 
hour-long session.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have to take very 
seriously what we are hearing from those who are in daily contact with 
investors," Carr said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We also have to keep a view of Canada's long-term competitive advantage."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the promise to build new pipelines, these are positive indicators, although there's no firm action yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The laundry list of 
concerns strikes to the fundamental issue for Canada's oil and gas 
sector today: Does the federal government really want to see the 
industry thrive and grow into the future? If so, what's it prepared to 
do to see that happen? Political tours, new reports and promises of 
support are welcomed, but there needs to be more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need to see an 
environment where this industry is supported," Broen concluded. Chris

 that reason, Wednesday's release of the Ecofiscal Commission's report 
on the effectiveness of carbon pricing to fight climate was a very 
timely addition to the debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney has voiced his 
party's intent to scrap Alberta's carbon tax and replace it with a 
system of sector-by-sector regulation while McKenna is moving ahead with
 a national carbon price in the absence of provincial programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa intends to implement a $20 per tonne carbon price in January 2019, rising to $50/tonne by 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It remains to be seen if 
Kenney's ideas would satisfy Ottawa, however, and the reality could be 
Alberta will have a carbon tax - whether that's the provincially 
designed system that now exists or a federally imposed one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Either way, there's no escaping a carbon price in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is why the 
Ecofiscal Commission report should be required reading for all 
politicians, carbon price skeptics and the wider population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Especially Albertans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A poll released alongside
 the report showed that of all provinces, Albertans demonstrated the 
lowest support for carbon pricing, at just nine per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's possible some of 
this negative sentiment is tied to the fact the carbon tax was not used a
 bargaining chip to pave the way for a successful outcome in terms of 
pipelines to either the east or west coasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, it was 
not used as a quid pro quo, as some believe should have happened. Yet 
the report's lead author, Chris Ragan, suggests that approach isn't the 
right one, either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ragan said trading carbon pricing for the <b>social licence</b> to build pipelines casts the <b>pipeline</b> as 'bad' - because it will only be built if something 'good' is put in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The truth is the <b>pipeline</b> is a good thing. We need carbon pricing to solve one problem and we need a <b>pipeline</b> to solve another problem," he said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The problem in this 
country is that these two things have become connected and they are 
almost completely disconnected. Our pipelines are about getting our oil 
to a world market that wants (it) and our carbon pricing is about making
 our consumers and our producers more emissions efficient."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This all means there is 
still a lot of work to do in better explaining how carbon pricing works,
 how it does not kill economic growth and why it is better than a 
regulatory approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's report is a step in that direction, while inserting some measured dialogue into a polarizing issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At the moment, Alberta 
is stuck debating for or against the carbon tax - as if there are no 
other options available," said Trevor Tombe , a professor of economics 
at the University of Calgary, citing regulation and technology subsidies
 as alternatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We ought to have that 
conversation regarding how we approach carbon emissions in Alberta 
because as the polls suggest the clear majority prefer action to no 
action; and now we should proceed to debate about the pros and cons of 
different policy tools."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike other reports, 
which Ragan admits were aimed at the policy level, this latest one is 
targeted at answering questions and satisfying skeptics as to why a 
carbon price makes sense, how it changes behaviour and doesn't harm 
economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ecofiscal Commission 
makes its case by using examples from British Columbia, California and 
the United Kingdom, since governments in those jurisdictions put a price
 on carbon. Alberta was not included in the analysis because its program
 has not been in place long enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the point the report -
 and Ragan - make is that it is the most effective method, in terms of 
changing behaviour and cost of implementation compared with a strictly 
regulatory approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Command and control 
regulations generally cost more than carbon pricing because they provide
 far less flexibility to businesses and households, and they typically 
ignore the important differences between them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenge with 
regulations is that companies know better about how to manage their 
operations than do governments - and regulations effectively impose a 
change by governments on how companies do business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A carbon price, on the 
other hand, provides incentives to change how companies operate without 
dictating what that change needs to look like. Net net, as investment 
bankers like to say, it ends up being cheaper than another layer of 
regulation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using B.C. as one example
 of the effectiveness of carbon pricing - Ragan points to the fact 
emissions there have dropped between five and 15 per cent since 2008 and
 the economy has done anything but stall. It should be said that 
province's economic growth has raised emissions on an absolute level, 
although they are lower than would have been the case without a carbon 
tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key factor in the recent success of B.C's economic growth is that its carbon tax was revenue neutral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that, said Tombe, was arguably the most surprising aspect to the polling data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The data showed 63 per 
cent of per cent of people who thought carbon pricing was a bad idea 
would be more supportive if the money was given back ... in the form of 
cutting other taxes by an equal amount. A revenue neutral carbon tax 
makes sense economically and politically," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's report and 
the polling data reinforce two things: action is preferred to no action 
when it comes to addressing climate change and the needle has not moved 
when it comes to energy literacy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is that 
finding common ground from which to solve complex issues such as climate
 change remains a challenge across the country. The latest Ecofiscal 
report is a good effort in constructively re-framing the conversation.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rumours have it the feds will agree to let Alberta's own assessment standards take precedence.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This
 would be a good thing. Even though our NDP's new assessment standards 
are too harsh, they are not as harsh as the ones being proposed by the 
Trudeau government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as nice as this new 
concession from the federal government would be, it's largely 
meaningless so long as the Trudeau government forges ahead with its new 
rules for <b>pipeline</b> construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This latest news has all 
the earmarks of a political trade-off: The federal Liberals will grant 
us permission to develop the oilsands (even though the constitution 
probably didn't require their permission in the first place), but they 
will deny us the pipelines we need to get our oil and bitumen to 
markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless and until the 
Trudeau government is prepared to withdraw its new assessment standards 
for major pipelines, the "victory" it will grant Alberta over the 
oilsands will be hollow, at best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should the exemption for 
oilsands developments be agreed to, expect a lot of clucking and crowing
 from the Alberta NDP government over how their carbon tax/Climate 
Leadership/"<b>social licence</b>" plan has paid off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Notley government 
will tell us the doubters were wrong; that Premier Rachel Notley's 
co-operation with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau DID work out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if we get only the oilsands concession and no change in proposed <b>pipeline</b>
 legislation, just what has the Alberta government achieved? We'll be 
able to mine bitumen and pump oil to our heart's content, but we won't 
be able to ship it anywhere, except (expensively and inefficiently) by 
rail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, lawyers 
studying Ottawa's new requirement that all future pipelines be subjected
 to a "genderbased analysis" confess to being confused by just how such 
an analysis would work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just how does "the intersection of sex and gender with other identity factors" impact pipelines? And, more importantly, how are <b>pipeline</b> companies supposed to prove to federal regulators that they have satisfied the gender-based tests? <b>Pipeline</b>
 builders already spend hundreds of millions surveying the impact of 
their projects on people, communities, water, animals, plants, even 
insects - yes, insects - along their proposed routes. But now federal 
approval might hinge on whether construction camps have enough female 
and "gender-diverse" workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if activists tell 
federal regulators they are worried the temporary presence of so many 
male workers will lead to more violence against local women or might 
increase the income gap between the sexes, that might prevent approval, 
too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trudeau government 
isn't backing away, either, from its insistence that Indigenous 
"traditional knowledge" be given equal standing with scientific research
 during the approval process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor is it weakening its requirement that <b>pipeline</b> companies account for all the upstream and downstream emissions of the products they carry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With all these new 
federal obstacles to pipelines - gender, Indigenous and environmental - 
it will be amazing if any company steps forward to risk billions on a 
new line from Alberta to anywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than jump through 
one federal regulatory hoop after another (with more hoops being added 
all the time), energy companies will simply pass Canada by. They will go
 the States and to countries such as Bahrain, Kazakhstan and Egypt, 
where the oil may be less plentiful, but where the governments are not 
run by Alice in Wonderland eco-zealots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, Canada has 
dropped to the lower half of countries in the world in which to invest 
in oil and gas, and the rumoured new federal oil sands exemption will do
 nothing to improve that.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's
 New Democratic government introduced its 2018-19 budget last week, and 
it is likely to be a pivotal moment for the grand and indubitably noble 
cause of democratic socialism, or social democracy, or whatever we're 
calling it now, in Alberta. Our next provincial election is supposed to 
happen, by statute, next spring - "on or before" May 31. If that is how 
things pan out, the New Democrats will get to introduce, and in theory 
run behind, an election budget. But in the meantime, a full year of 
campaigning will have taken place, and will have been conducted on the 
basis of last week's budget.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One
 of the key themes will be carbon taxation. In arguments about the 
Alberta carbon tax, the design of the actual instrument has mostly been 
beside the point until now. The whole idea of taxing carbon, as such, 
strikes at the heart of Alberta's cultural self-identification: to many 
Albertans, raised on tales of Leduc No. 1 and the National Energy 
Program and the Heritage Fund, it is morally offensive in itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta is about 
hydrocarbons in sort of the same deep sense in which Quebec can be 
thought of as being "about" the French language. An Alberta carbon tax 
(a pioneering, world-leading one!) was always going to play, with large 
Alberta audiences, as an act of hysterical self-mortification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP had to know that 
there would be an inherent political price to be paid for its approach -
 that its carbon policy would, for some Albertans, be altogether beyond 
rational discussion. But nobody should underestimate the number of 
Albertans who are at the far opposite end of this spectrum - equally 
beyond reason in the other direction. A lot of Albertans hate that 
Alberta is about hydrocarbons: they go about in a state of constant 
low-level eco-spleen. Almost certainly the business of 
hydrocarbon-digging brought their parents here, or their grandparents, 
but they have grown up with endless propaganda about the species' 
planet-killing error of ever using fossil fuels, and they naturally feel
 trapped or swindled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP's carbon tax 
rhetoric was designed to appeal to those who lie between these two poles
 of irrationality. The United Conservatives have already spent a lot of 
time heckling the New Democrats over their implied promise that a carbon
 tax would provide <b>social licence</b> for <b>pipeline</b> projects 
that might help Alberta realize un-discounted world prices for 
ecologically laundered oil. The preferred rebuttal of carbon-tax 
advocates is that "<b>social licence</b>" is actually oil-industry 
jargon. But there can be no doubt that the carbon tax was designed, and 
politically marketed, on the basis of reputational benefits that have 
not yet panned out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta Finance Minister 
Joe Ceci hugs Premier Rachel Notley after delivering the 2018-19 budget 
in the Alberta Legislature on March 22.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Rachel Notley has talked a pretty good game about Alberta deserving to 
benefit from appropriately taxed carbon-grubbing, but the UCP can show 
that her caucus and her braintrust are full of former splenetics who 
used to wave handmade protest signs about Dirty Oil. The fallback 
argument, for the NDP, is that the carbon tax is a worthwhile incentive 
in itself. The point is not merely to hoover up new revenue, but simply 
to price, and thereby discourage, carbon pollution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be useful for 
the NDP to show, in making this argument, that the tax was wholly 
revenue-neutral - that it was not being used to increase the size of 
government, but was being given back to Albertans. The 2018-19 budget 
makes that part of the case more complicated for them. Under the new 
implied provincial price of $30 per ton of carbon emitted, the revenues 
from carbon taxation are expected to come to about $1.4 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only $525 million of that
 will be handed back to Alberta taxpayers directly, in rebate cheques to
 lower-income households. The government intends to spend more than 
what's left over from that revenue - over a billion dollars - on 
carbon-abatement projects under the Climate Leadership Plan. Close to 
half will go to public transit and other public infrastructure; over 
$200 million will be used to support coal towns being annihilated by the
 decarbonization of Alberta electricity; some of it will go to favoured 
"clean tech" researchers and businesses.</p>

 )</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New Democratic 
narrative will be that this should not really count as a tax grab, 
because the money, having most definitely been grabbed, is to be 
"reinvested" within Alberta. But if the most important point of the 
carbon tax was the price incentive, the NDP could have cut other taxes 
to make it truly revenue-neutral. It could even have provided a bigger, 
even more progressive cash rebate that wasn't a mere fraction of the 
revenue yield. (Mind you, I am aware of no leftist radical anywhere who 
is criticizing the Alberta carbon tax on this basis.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's worse, the federal
 government's umbrella carbon tax plan will increase the implied carbon 
price to $40 a ton in 2021, while passing the money along to Alberta, 
and the NDP's fiscal plan admits that, if it is still in charge, it will
 keep the additional money for use in "general revenue." If you're a 
middle-ground Albertan who is comfortable with a carbon tax as a 
concept, what do you have left to say to anyone who warned that such a 
tax could easily be increased, and might become another way of stiffing 
the taxpayer and increasing government expenditure? This is a surrender 
of moral high ground to essentially religious pro-carbon sentiment: 
those zanies, it seems, warned us of a millennium that is arriving fast.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 throne speech that marked the opening of the legislature earlier this 
month was clearly aimed at more than just Albertans. One of its key 
themes was the need to get our oil to tidewater, where it will fetch a 
higher price than fuel sold to the United States, which is where the 
great majority of our energy is exported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The speech, read by 
Lt.-Gov. Lois Mitchell, had British Columbians in mind; in particular, 
Premier John Horgan, who has voiced strong opposition to the Trans 
Mountain <b>pipeline</b>.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The
 dispute British Columbia triggered with its attack on Canadian workers 
will not stand," the government said in the speech. "We won't let it. We
 have been vigilant in defending our workers and we will remain 
vigilant."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a well-crafted 
message, but when the government's budget is released Thursday 
afternoon, the Rachel Notley government must ensure Albertans'interests 
are at the heart of its fiscal blueprint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since coming to power in 
2015, the NPD has posted irresponsible deficits. Its predecessor, the 
Conservative party, also failed to balance the books under successive 
premiers, but there was nothing like the NDP has done in the supposed 
defence of front-line services such as health care and education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP has spent 
taxpayer money with abandon, to the point that credit agencies, which 
determine how much Albertans will pay in interest on the massive amount 
of borrowing, have downgraded the province's rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP is clearly an 
ally of the organized labour movement, but it needs to expand its reach 
and popularity if it hopes to win re-election next spring. Many 
Albertans are seeking some financial prudence as opposed to the spending
 free-for-all we've been witness to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worryingly, that's not 
likely to be the case when Thursday's budget is revealed. Finance 
Minister Joe Ceci said Tuesday the document will include anticipated 
revenue from expansion of the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b>, apparently with the aim of balancing the budget within five years - well after the next election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No sensible homeowner 
would cobble together a budget with the assumption they'd be getting a 
pay increase in a few years. And yet this is what passes for NDP 
mathematics - the hope that having imposed a punitive carbon tax on its 
citizens to win so-called <b>social licence</b> for pipelines, that 
politicians who are indifferent to energy infrastructure, or openly 
oppose them, are going to facilitate the flow of billions of dollars 
into Alberta's coffers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP have proven to be
 poor money managers, but surely we're not to have faith in such wild 
speculation. Opposition Leader Jason Kenney sees the danger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We obviously hope that 
Trans Mountain gets built quickly, but what we've seen is a year of 
delays already and the very strong potential of yet further delays," 
said the United Conservative Party leader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is putting a lot of eggs in one uncertain basket, and that's not how you budget."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government should 
focus instead on reducing costs. Last year's budget projected that by 
2020, Alberta's debt will be $70 billion - which is the equivalent of 
$16,500 for every person in the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists Janice 
MacKinnon and Jack Mintz argue that Alberta can learn lessons from other
 provinces, such as Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia, which spent an
 average of $9,233 per capita last year on services. Alberta spent 
$12,409 per person - that's $3,176 more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In health care alone, 
they note, Alberta spends $915 more per capita than the average of the 
other three large provinces, which means spending $3.8 billion more 
annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP shouldn't put 
revenue from incompleted pipelines in its ledgers. It should engage in 
the thoughtful work Albertans elected them to do and focus on reducing 
expenses.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal Liberals seemed to be on to a winner with the idea that they would win <b>social licence</b> for a new <b>pipeline</b> on the West Coast by introducing a carbon pricing plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Polls suggested this compact had the support of majorities in every region.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But
 in recent days, there has been a great deal of noise about the plan 
unravelling, as the Alberta and B.C. governments slugged it out over the
 expansion of the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b>, and as the election of
 carbon tax opponent Doug Ford as the new leader of the Progressive 
Conservatives in Ontario raised questions about the participation of the
 largest province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Jason Kenney, 
the opposition leader in Alberta, has been trying to enlist provincial 
leaders to join in a constitutional challenge to the federal 
government's pan-Canadian framework on clean growth and climate change, 
which imposes a carbon tax on any province that does not put a minimum 
price on carbon by next January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Environment 
Minister Catherine Mc-Kenna sounded rattled last weekend when she urged 
progressive voters to get behind Ottawa's grand bargain or watch the 
climate change plan blow up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while the political consensus has evaporated, the legislative underpinnings remain firmly in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government of British
 Columbia has no constitutional grounds to block Trans Mountain and the 
provinces have no constitutional case to overturn Ottawa's "backstop" 
power that would see it collect a carbon tax in provinces that refuse to
 set their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a classic test of 
federalism. Ottawa decides on national policy and the provinces choose 
to go along or not," said David McLaughlin, a former climate change 
adviser to the Manitoba government who worked as Brian Mulroney's chief 
of staff in the 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he was advising 
Brian Pallister's government on its revenue-neutral carbon tax in 
Manitoba, McLaughlin said the provincial government sought a legal 
opinion on whether the feds were within their constitutional rights to 
impose a carbon tax. The answer was clearly in the affirmative, at which
 point Pallister decided he wanted to receive the proceeds, rather than 
send them to Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small wonder. The feds 
have been blunt - in essence, "if you don't co-operate, we'll levy the 
tax and send a rebate cheque back to taxpayers, with a Canadian flag on 
it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ford has said he will get
 rid of Ontario's existing capand-trade program if elected premier. But 
he is faced with the legal reality that he will have to come up with 
some kind of carbon pricing or have a regime foisted upon him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney, of course, knows this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is playing Potemkin politics, as is B.C. Premier John Horgan, who is making anti-<b>pipeline</b>
 noises to shore up his environmental wing, upset because the NDP 
government has decided to continue construction of the Site C dam hydro 
project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same game is being 
played by Alberta Premier Rachel Notley, who has seen a first glimmer of
 hope in the polls after engaging in a phoney political war with 
Horgan's government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal Liberals must be concerned about the growing protests at <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s
 Burnaby, B.C., terminal, where 15 people were arrested on Monday. There
 is every prospect that this could become a continental cause celebre 
for the environmental movement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the feds appear to be
 holding their nerve, bolstered by polls suggesting that, even in B.C., 
support outweighs opposition. Sources suggest Ottawa has told <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> it is 100 per cent behind the project and warned the B.C. government that it has no grounds to overturn the approval process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best and most 
realistic hope for those opposed to a carbon tax is for Andrew Scheer to
 win the next federal election in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ed Fast, the Conservative
 environment critic, said his party is still developing its climate 
change plan "but one thing that will not be part of it is a carbon tax."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fast once flirted with 
the idea of a revenue-neutral tax as a market-driven tool to reduce 
emissions, but said his experience in British Columbia is that the 
principle does not work in practise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Carbon taxes might work 
on paper but they don't work in the real world. Even if it is initially 
introduced as a revenue-neutral tax, you get changes in government and 
it becomes a cash cow for governments to spend," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the amount being 
charged in tax is insufficient to change human behaviour enough to meet 
emissions targets, while the carbon surcharge risks damaging Canada's 
competitiveness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fast pointed out that the
 federal government's claim that all revenues will go back to the 
provinces where they were raised is misleading. The government admitted 
this week in a written answer to a question by Conservative MP Robert 
Kitchen that the GST revenue collected on a carbon tax will be sent back
 to Ottawa, rather than rebated locally. The Parliamentary Budget 
Officer estimated that carbon pricing from the four largest provinces 
could net the federal government more than $500 million over two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, any fool can 
criticize - and many do. The Conservatives have to win the election 
before they can tear down Trudeau's carbon tax regime - and, to do that,
 it seems likely they will need to have a credible alternative to 
Trudeau's carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberal case for reelection is based on the contention that they "get the big things right."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the fire and the fury surrounding the <b>pipeline</b>/carbon tax compact, the Trudeau government remains on course to deliver on its promise to put a price on carbon and build a <b>pipeline</b> to salt water.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A judge in Johannesburg

 the victim’s family.” In the transportation industry, such a death was 
widely considered inevitable as the number of self-driving vehicles

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Canada is timidly back. The Liberal government announced the return to <span class="companylink">UN peacekeeping</span>
 in a timorous voice. In a press scrum, Foreign Affairs Minister 
Chrystia Freeland let slip that caution is the watchword for the mission
 that Canadian Forces will take on in Mali. The government, she said, 
wanted to make ‘a real contribution in as careful a way as possible.’ 
That was an apt description for what Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan 
announced: Two transport helicopters and four attack helicopters will be
 sent to Mali, with crews, support troops and medical staff. It’s not 
boots on the ground, in the sense that Canadian troops won’t patrol 
dangerous areas of Mali, a country where Islamist terrorists harass 
civilians and have killed 99 United Nations peacekeepers so far. It is 
birds in the sky, and that’s a lot less risky.“ — Campbell Clark (for

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The coming carbon tax showdown</p>

that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Everybody

 victims’ suffering under the rug. It has offered a long overdue voice 
to the vulnerable in an unprecedented way. But its unintended side

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">March 20, 2007- They 
called her Gentle Warrior. But the woman known as the poet laureate of 
the Mi’kmaq people had battle scars, earned from childhood. Rita Bernard
 was born in Whycocomagh, Cape Breton, on March 15, 1932. Her mother 
died when she was 5; her father when she was 10. She lived in numerous 
foster homes and suffered abuse. At 12, she arrived at Shubenacadie 
Indian Residential School. She thought it looked like a castle; later, 
she compared it to prison. After four years there, she had to relearn 
Mi’kmaq, her native language, as she later recounted in her poem, I Lost
 My Talk. She eventually married Frank Joe and they raised eight 
children, including two foster children. “Only a housewife with a 
dream,” as she described herself, she began writing in her 30s. But she 
went on to publish seven books, including an autobiography, Song of Rita
 Joe, and was awarded the Order of Canada. I Lost My Talk eventually 
became the basis for a <span class="companylink">National Arts Centre</span>
 show and was quoted in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission report. 
“Let me find my talk, so I can teach you about me,” it ends. Rita Joe 
died March 20, 2007, an unfinished poem in her typewriter. Marsha

calls it. And now, the anti-carbon-tax crusader Doug Ford could well 
become premier of Ontario. It's hard to see how Mr. Trudeau will impose 
his grand bargain on the provinces if Alberta and Ontario are in open 
revolt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what about the rest of us?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liberals, 
environmentalists and economists tell us carbon taxes are a virtually 
painless way to get us to act virtuously, by cutting down on fossil 
fuels. They are a good tax. Unfortunately, too many of us don't like 
them anyway. As Mr. Ford likes to say whenever he has a chance, “A tax 
is a tax is a tax."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carbon taxes are 
allegedly revenue-neutral because the money is returned to taxpayers in 
the form of rebates or offset by lower taxes elsewhere. But the reality 
is different. In fact, governments can't keep their greedy mitts off the
 money. Even the model province of British Columbia is now diverting 
part of its provincial carbon tax to fund tax credits for preferred 
groups, such as filmmakers. In Alberta, only about a quarter of the 
amount raised by the carbon tax is rebated to taxpayers. Sadly, there is
 a vast difference between the pure world of economic models and the 
grubby world of politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another problem with 
carbon taxes is that you can't possibly make them high enough to be 
effective. If you did you'd be voted out of office. Mr. Trudeau's 
national carbon pricing scheme would start at $10 a tonne, going up to 
$50 by 2022 – enough to be a nuisance, but not nearly enough to affect 
consumer behaviour in any meaningful way. Achieving real behavioural 
change, environmental economists say, would cost many times more. 
According to Simon Fraser University economist Mark Jaccard, carbon 
taxes can only have real impact if governments also introduce a bunch of
 costly and heavy-handed regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, carbon 
taxes can't save the planet. Despite what politicians tell you, they 
basically amount to useless virtuesignalling. But Mr. Trudeau, Ms. 
Notley and Environment Minister Catherine McKenna aren't going to tell 
you this because they want you to believe they have a plan and that the 
plan will work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the date for Mr. 
Trudeau's carbon tax gets closer, taxpayers might start asking an even 
more basic question: What difference will this make in the big scheme of
 things? As India and China and the whole developing world increase 
energy use, and the United States extracts more fossil fuel than ever in
 its history, why are we getting this darn tax?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no good answer 
for that. The gap between reality and our intentions is unfathomably 
vast. To avoid the most serious effects of global warming, we should be 
adding about 1,100 megawatts of clean-energy capacity a day – equivalent
 to one nuclear power plant – according to the the MIT Technology 
Review. What we're actually adding: 151 megawatts a day. The 
technologies that are needed to cut emissions deeply simply haven't been
 developed yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“[V]irtually all sober 
analyses conclude that the target [of two degrees of warming] is now 
unobtainable," climate expert Ted Nordhaus wrote in Foreign Affairs. But
 don't blame venal politicians or evil industry. The root of the problem
 is much more basic, he argues: “Decarbonization is hard." He calls the 
insistence that we can meet the 2 C threshold a dangerous delusion that 
distracts us from what we can do to address the changes that are coming 
no matter what.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of this is a 
rationale for doing nothing. We should be doing a lot, on many fronts, 
to develop the breakthrough technologies that will really make a 
difference. Forking over billions for government to use however they 
like does not strike me as part of the solution.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If
 there's one thing I hope all Albertans can agree on, it's the desperate
 need for more pipelines to get our abundant oil and gas resources to 
market. According to recent reports, Alberta is losing $7 billion per 
year because of lack of <b>pipeline</b> capacity, with industry losing $6.7 billion more annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While we disagree with 
how the NDP has handled the strategy surrounding the Trans Mountain 
expansion, we don't doubt the need for the <b>pipeline</b>.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It
 wasn't that long ago when pipelines were built in this country with 
little controversy. Under the previous Harper government, four major <b>pipeline</b>
 projects were completed. Keystone, Alberta Clipper, the Line 9 reversal
 and Anchor Loop were all successfully completed under the previous 
government, adding 1.73 million barrels per day of capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, it is true that none
 of these projects were to tidewater, as the NDP is happy to point out. 
But Trans Mountain was not up for government approval under the previous
 Conservative government. The NDP's cousins in Ottawa would no doubt 
have howled if the Harper government dared to short circuit the 
regulatory process by approving a <b>pipeline</b> before a thorough review was completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northern Gateway, the one tidewater <b>pipeline</b>
 up for decision under the Harper Conservatives, was indeed approved. 
Sadly, the project was retroactively cancelled by the Trudeau Liberals 
as part of their plan to ban tanker traffic off B.C.'s northern coast 
(never mind that Alaskan tankers have travelled down that route for 
decades). And the Trudeau Liberals later rigged the approval process 
midstream to scuttle Energy East, another <b>pipeline</b> to tidewater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, radical 
activists have engaged in a concerted effort to specifically target and 
sideline Canada's oil and gas industry. Millions of dollars of foreign 
funding have flooded into the Canadian environmental movement with the 
clear goal of starving our resources of markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta NDP government promised that imposing a carbon tax on Albertans would buy so-called <b>social licence</b> in B.C. for a <b>pipeline</b>
 to the Pacific. We are baffled the Alberta government bought this 
argument, since it's their fellow travellers - both the B.C. NDP and 
radical environmental activists such as Tzeporah Berman - who are 
leading the fight against the approved Trans Mountain expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surely, the Alberta NDP understood that their friends would not be willing to trade a carbon tax for a <b>pipeline</b>. In fact, Premier Rachel Notley finally acknowledged this reality in a recent interview with <span class="companylink">CBC Radio</span>. When asked why not put a hold on the carbon tax until the <b>pipeline</b> begins construction, she responded, "quite honestly, I don't know that B.C. would care one way or another if we did that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The truth is that the Trudeau Liberals provided paper regulatory approval for the <b>pipeline</b>,
 purportedly because of Alberta's willingness to impose a carbon tax on 
its citizens. Yet today, the Trudeau Liberals are willing to do little 
beyond rhetoric to fight for Trans Mountain in the face of vociferous 
opposition in B.C., hurting the 51 First Nations that have signed off in
 support of the <b>pipeline</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's in all Albertans'interest to see this <b>pipeline</b>
 succeed. We in the United Conservative Party welcome the government's 
recent about face. After months mocking our suggestions to threaten the 
B.C. NDP with serious consequences, including potentially cutting off 
oil shipments and tolling B.C. natural gas, the premier has finally 
accepted our advice, albeit far too late.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We welcome a robust, serious debate on what's needed to get this <b>pipeline</b>
 built. But we should not be deluded into the fantasy that punitive 
taxes on everyday Albertans will appease the fringe yet extremely vocal 
anti-<b>pipeline</b> minority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, we must make it 
clear to the vast majority of reasonable Canadians that the success of 
our energy sector is critical for the success of our country, and that 
Alberta cannot be taken for granted any longer. Prasad Panda is the 
United Conservative MLA for Calgary-Foothills.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not complaining, but I'm still trying to figure out who is the funny one and who is the straight man.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 first week of Alberta's new legislative session was entertaining in its
 own way with the arrival of Jason Kenney as official Opposition leader 
across the floor from Premier Rachel Notley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were no political 
pyrotechnics, as Kenney made sure the UCP caucus members sat with 
decorous civility during question period. No thumping of desks or 
clapping of hands or heckling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were times the 
oddly quiet Opposition caucus seemed to be playing the straight man to 
the NDP's desk-pounding theatrics. But there were times Kenney was 
clearly the one with the jokes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Notley used question
 period to ask Kenney questions, he quipped, "I see the honourable 
premier is auditioning to be opposition leader."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Question period, of 
course, is supposed to be about opposition politicians asking the 
government questions, not the other way around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Kenney's arrival has managed to turn Alberta's legislative norms on their head.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He poses such a threat to the government that he has Notley trying to hold him to account.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Albertans deserve to 
know: does the member opposite believe that human activity is causing 
climate change? Yes or no?" asked Notley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I am a carbon tax 
skeptic," replied Kenney, not answering the question. "Of course there's
 climate change. I've never denied that." She asked him again. "Does the
 member opposite believe that human activity is the primary cause of 
climate change? Yes or no?" He stuck to his attack on the government's 
carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, Notley went at him again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Yes or no. Does he 
believe that human activity is the primary cause of climate change?" 
That's when Kenney made his joke about Notley auditioning for the role 
of Opposition leader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Depending on your 
perspective, Notley looks rattled by Kenney's appearance in the assembly
 or she has a legitimate concern about his stand on man-made climate 
change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's actually both. 
Notley should be worried about the Kenney juggernaut steamrollering its 
way to the next election. It has flattened all opponents before it in 
the past 18 months as Kenney tenaciously moved from outsider to 
Progressive Conservative leader to founder of the United Conservative 
Party to leader of the UCP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, Notley 
is right to question where Kenney stands on man-made (or "anthropogenic"
 as he likes to call it) climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talking to journalists 
this week, Kenney said he accepts the scientific consensus that humans 
are playing a "significant" role in driving climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But ... "I think there's a
 legitimate range of perspectives about exactly to what degree 
anthropogenic causes are behind climate change."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actually, there's not a "legitimate range of perspectives."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overwhelming majority of climate scientists say human activity is the primary driver of global warming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To suggest humans are not the primary culprit is to give yourself wiggle room to do little or nothing to combat climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why Notley is 
pushing Kenney. She's hoping he'll trip himself up by admitting the UCP 
doesn't, and won't, have a climate change plan because it doesn't really
 think it's a problem worth tackling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley wants Kenney to 
damage his credibility much the same way Danielle Smith did in the 2012 
election when, as leader of the Wildrose, she made comments that cast 
her as a climate change denier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not a trap, though, Kenney will go anywhere near.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, he'll ignore her
 question or give equivocating answers and focus on the fiscal side of 
the climate debate: the carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax is unpopular and it will remain unpopular unless it buys us the "<b>social licence</b>" needed to get the $7.4-billion <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> <b>pipeline</b> expansion built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, Kenney 
introduced a private member's bill that would put any further increases 
in the carbon tax to a public referendum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His bill is pure showmanship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government will never
 let it pass. But Kenney is doing his best to turn the government's 
fight over climate change into a debate over taxation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If your goal is to tackle global warming, he has engaged in a cynical and deplorable move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if your goal is to 
undermine the NDP, it's a shrewd and clever political tactic.

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier Rachel Notley recently laid out her government's plan for the near term via the government's recent throne speech.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are three things that taxpayers should note.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, it's positive to see Premier Notley continues to publicly push for the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b>
 project - an initiative that will pay a fortune in taxes to the Alberta
 government and create jobs and opportunities for our province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's important that the 
premier has spoken out and has seemingly muzzled radical 
environmentalists in her own party on the issue - such as her education 
minister who previously led a chant at a protest at the legislature 
against the oil sands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, what should also be clear by now is that Premier Notley's carbon tax hasn't earned our province the "<b>social licence</b>" we were promised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The premier is shutting 
down coal power plants, Albertans have paid a fortune in carbon taxes 
and other new costly environmental regulations have been layered on our 
economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite all those moves, radical environmentalists in B.C. are still protesting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only have we lost 
jobs because of these policies, the government's own numbers suggest our
 province still won't meet climate change targets in the Paris Accord.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what's the point? 
Clearly, it's time to scrap the carbon tax and pursue a new, 
taxpayer-friendly approach. For example, let's refocus on getting 
Canada's natural gas over to China so that we can offset some of their 
coal power plants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second point 
Albertans should be mindful about is the section in the throne speech 
that boasts about reducing "hospitality and travel costs" and providing 
"no raises" for teachers and nurses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's true the government reduced travel and hospitality costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our calculations - based 
on an enormous spreadsheet released by the government - shows a $4 
million reduction in travel and hospitality expenses over the past four 
@colincraig1 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a great step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the grand scheme of the province's $56-billion budget, it's not a lot of money, but it's a good case of leading by example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for "no raises" for teachers and nurses - that's just not true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Calgary and Edmonton school boards indicated in letters to the <span class="companylink">Canadian Taxpayers Federation</span> that a combined 6,842 teachers in their divisions are receiving a pay increase this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thousands of other teachers across the province will also receive a pay increase due to the way the contract was negotiated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many teachers in Alberta 
will still receive a true freeze, but for the government to suggest that
 all teachers are receiving a freeze is simply not true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, the government's
 news release about the throne speech notes, "work will continue with 
the public sector to reduce costs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the government has 
trimmed some spending, taxpayers should know that overall spending has 
increased every year since the NDP were elected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the government is currently on pace to spend about $1 billion more this year than they originally budgeted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debt is still expected to more than triple during Premier Notley's four years in office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that's the big 
picture problem with the Alberta government's approach - some tinkering 
around the edges, but not enough in terms of bold action to get the 
province's spending under control and get our province back on the right
 track.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Poor Rachel Notley. She's spent so much of her political career telling people about the importance of <b>social licence</b> only to find out, in her hour of need, that the federal government won't get her one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one would ever confuse
 the premier of Alberta for a stalwart friend of the province's energy 
sector. But since this former oilsands critic became premier she has, at
 least, acknowledged a more realistic view of fossil fuels and their 
importance to a modern economy, and the need to get her province's oil 
to tidewater for export. But she also told Albertans they would need to 
make sacrifices to win over opponents, demonstrating the province's 
environmental bona fides, never mind the fact that Alberta's oil was 
already the most environmentally friendly petroleum in the world. She 
imposed a carbon tax. She put caps on the oilsands. Albertans paid 
dearly for her plan.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alas,
 all those efforts have bought little support from B.C, where Notley's 
fellow NDP premier, propped up by a handful of Green MLAs, isn't about 
to let Alberta make any progress on the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b> 
expansion. The federal government, too, despite the occasional 
supportive grunt, certainly doesn't seem inclined to do much more than 
offer repeated, vague restatements about approved projects needing to 
move ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley has understandably
 had enough. Now she says Alberta won't increase its carbon tax to $50 
per tonne, in line with federal commitments to a national target, as 
originally intended, until Ottawa treats Alberta with the same respect. 
"Our government was very clear well over a year ago that we will sign on
 to the federal government's pan-Canadian framework with the approval of
 the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b>," she said in the legislature this 
week. "Now, obviously, approval means nothing if it's not constructed 
... we will not move forward ... until we see that construction is fully
 underway and that approval is given meaning."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not hard to see the 
play she's making. Having given up on finding any common cause with 
B.C., she's ramping up the pressure on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, 
another self-styled progressive. It's a not a bad idea: Losing Notley, 
who's been an ally for the PM on the climate file so far, will be 
unfortunate for the federal Liberals and their dreams of a national 
carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one should hold their breath waiting for Trudeau to actually do much. The PM knows the drill: talk a lot about <b>social licence</b>,
 and then wait interminably for a licence that will never be given to 
never arrive. It's the progressive way. It's a wonder that Notley didn't
 know that.</p>

She's spent so much of her political career telling people about the importance of <b>social licence</b> only to find out, in her hour of need, that the federal government won't get her one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one would ever confuse
 the premier of Alberta for a stalwart friend of the province's energy 
sector. But since this former oilsands critic became premier she has, at
 least, acknowledged a more realistic view of fossil fuels and their 
importance to a modern economy, and the need to get her province's oil 
to tidewater for export. But she also told Albertans they would need to 
make sacrifices to win over opponents, demonstrating the province's 
environmental bona fides, never mind the fact that Alberta's oil was 
already the most environmentally friendly petroleum in the world. She 
imposed a carbon tax. She put caps on the oil sands. Albertans paid 
dearly for her plan.</p>

 all those efforts have bought little support from B.C, where Notley's 
fellow NDP premier, propped up by a handful of Green MLAs, isn't about 
to let Alberta make any progress on the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b> 
expansion. The federal government, too, despite the occasional 
supportive grunt, certainly doesn't seem inclined to do much more than 
offer repeated, vague restatements about approved projects needing to 
move ahead.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley has understandably
 had enough. Now she says Alberta won't increase its carbon tax to $50 
per tonne, in line with federal commitments to a national target, as 
originally intended, until Ottawa treats Alberta with the same respect. 
"Our government was very clear well over a year ago that we will sign on
 to the federal government's pan-Canadian framework with the approval of
 the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b>," she said in the legislature this 
week. "Now, obviously, approval means nothing if it's not constructed 
... we will not move forward ... until we see that construction is fully
 underway and that approval is given meaning."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not hard to see the 
play she's making. Having given up on finding any common cause with 
B.C., she's ramping up the pressure on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, 
another self-styled progressive. It's a not a bad idea: Losing Notley, 
who's been am ally for the PM on the climate file so far, will be 
unfortunate for the federal Liberals and their dreams of a national 
carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one should hold their breath waiting for Trudeau to actually do much. The PM knows the drill: talk a lot about <b>social licence</b>,
 and then wait interminably for a licence that will never be given to 
never arrive. It's the progressive way. It's a wonder that Notley didn't
 know that.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Party leader Jason Kenney
 introduced a private member's bill Thursday that would ban any future 
hikes on the existing tax or on reinstating such a levy in the future 
without a referendum.</p>

 should get the final say before the government digs deeper into their 
pockets," Kenney said after introducing the bill, which would need the 
support of Premier Rachel Notley's government to become law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney has called the 
carbon tax an unfair burden on Alberta residents, with little benefit to
 reaching greenhouse gas emission targets or to getting oil pipelines 
built. He has promised to kill the tax if he becomes premier in the 2019
 election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The levy was imposed by 
Notley in 2017 on heating and gasoline to fund green projects ranging 
from solar panels to multibillion-dollar transit projects and programs 
to phase out coalfired electricity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province is taking in
 about $1 billion this fiscal year from the levy, but is returning some 
of that through rebates to middle and low-income families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The UCP contends the carbon tax has failed in its main objective to buy "<b>social licence</b>" and give Alberta some moral high ground against <b>pipeline</b> opponents by demonstrating it is committed to balancing resource development with environmental stewardship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government house leader 
Brian Mason, responding to Kenney's bill, said the tax is succeeding, 
and led to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government approving the 
Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b> expansion from Edmonton to Burnaby in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It [the tax and climate 
plan] is probably our best tool to keep the federal government's nose to
 the grindstone when it comes to seeing through the decision to build 
the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b>, and Mr. Kenney would strike it from our hands," said Mason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta is losing millions of dollars a day because its heavy oil is discounted due to <b>pipeline</b> bottlenecks and lack of access to customers in overseas markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trans Mountain line 
would triple the crude going west from Alberta, but the project is 
opposed by the British Columbia government and has been tied up in 
permit delays, court challenges and political roadblocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley banned wine from 
B.C. for two weeks in February in protest. Last week she announced she 
will get legislation passed giving her the option to cut oil exports to 
B.C. and grant power to take punitive action on natural gas shipments 
that travel from B.C. through Alberta to the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She has also urged 
Trudeau's government to step up in the fight, given that 
inter-provincial pipelines are federal responsibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley reiterated 
Thursday that her government has tied its compliance with Trudeau's 
federal climate plan, and the looming federal tax on carbon, to the 
success of the Trans Mountain line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The issue around additional levies is definitely linked to the <b>pipeline</b>, and our government - as I've said before - will not move forward until we get the <b>pipeline</b>."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal climate plan 
would tax greenhouse gas emissions starting at $10 per tonne this year, 
rising $10 a year to $50 a tonne in 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta taxes greenhouse 
gases at $30 a tonne, and Kenney has been pushing Notley on whether she 
will challenge Ottawa if it tries to impose a tax above the province's 
current rate.</p>

 latest proof is in, although the facts have been obvious for many 
years. Foreigners are financing and organizing opposition in Canada to 
natural resource development, part of an anti-fossil-fuel campaign that 
is costing our economy an estimated $15 billion this year, due to lack 
of access to international markets, and much more in lost capital 
investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the most recent 
little gem will finally get the chattering class to acknowledge reality:
 A leaked U.S. document preparing mass-action protests against <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b>
 expansion project. It sets out goals and operating principles for a 
clandestine organization designed to drive political resistance under 
the guise of an independent rank-and-file protest movement.</p>

 a California-based NGO "building a global grassroots climate movement."
 Using insect analogies (theirs, not mine) the "Hive" contributes money,
 action and organizational experience and technical know-how, while a 
"Swarm" will generate mass action. Fenton is explicit about its "Purpose
 &amp; Shared Goals: This group is coming together to support mass 
popular resistance to construction of the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> <b>pipeline</b>."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not the only U.S.
 organization devoted to blocking development of Canada's oil and gas 
reserves that, incidentally, would compete with America's own resources.
 Vivian Krause, a Vancouver-based researcher and writer, has documented 
the money funnelled through Tides Foundation, New Venture Fund and the 
Oak Foundation to impede Canadian hydrocarbon growth, especially the oil
 sands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These organizations are 
bolstered by a coterie of narcissistic celebrities whose vacuous 
certainty is outdone by their ignorance of science and economics and 
their extravagant carbon-intensive lifestyles.? All this brings to mind 
when, as minister of natural resources, I wrote an open letter labelling
 certain environmental groups as "radicals," financed in part by 
non-Canadian donors. The derisive outcry was deafening from media, 
opposition parties, ENGOs and even a few timorous senior executives in 
the oil and gas business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I defined radical as 
opposition to every major resource project. Moreover, I issued a 
challenge to any environmental organization to name a single <b>pipeline</b>
 project that it supported. The silence was deafening. Possibly because 
my definition sounded too reasonable, the media never reported on my 
explanation of the definition or the challenge, which I reiterated 
numerous times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What I said was factual 
then and has been conclusively proven to be true over the past six 
years. Trying to shut down fossil-fuel development is not viewed as 
radical to many environmentalists, even though the economic consequences
 would be disastrous. Or perhaps it was impolite in Canada to use the 
"r" word. It was obviously politically incorrect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Irrespective of terminology, we have undoubtedly reached a crisis resulting from unrelenting opposition to <b>pipeline</b> construction, abetted by foreign funding and a federal government obsessed with green ideology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is telling that 
opponents are unimpressed by governments' efforts to reduce greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions. They understand that Canada cannot make a 
meaningful difference to international emissions, since our output 
represents only 1.6 per cent of the global total. Their focus is on the 
oil sands, which they claim can measurably add to the global supply of 
oil, so keeping fossil fuels in the ground is their goal. The fact the 
oil sands only represent a minuscule one-thousandth of global emissions 
makes it the wrong target. But symbolism is everything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Militants are indifferent
 to the terrible damage they are inflicting on our economy, First 
Nations and the poor, all without any measurable impact on global 
warming. Further, they assert that Canada has a moral responsibility to 
make costly but ineffective sacrifices, even though other countries are 
not doing their share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The B.C. government's campaign against the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b> expansion proves there is no point in succumbing to extortionate demands or making costly concessions to achieve an elusive <b>social licence</b>.
 The goal posts keep moving. By now, that must be evident even to 
Alberta Premier Rachel Notley and federal Natural Resource Minister Jim 
Carr, though they will never admit it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At what point might <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 headquarters in Houston cancel the project in frustration with its 
mounting financial and reputational risk? That would landlock Canada's 
energy for a very long time, a disastrous result, which is the goal of 
opponents. It is time for Parliament to declare the <b>pipeline</b> a 
work "for the general advantage of Canada," thereby removing most 
dilatory tactics (but not social resistance). Prime Minister Justin 
Trudeau should also tell foreign agitators to butt out of Canadian 
affairs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall says what he calls the New Left are the likes of today's NDP and the Trudeau version of the Liberals.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think we're going to find out if fiscal responsibility is cool again. Because most decidedly it is not cool right now."</p>

 chicken came home to roost and there was pain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall figures we might have "collective amnesia" about what went on back then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"How could we have 
forgotten the importance of fiscal responsibility?" Wall says the Notley
 NDP are being "shortsighted" with their spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few days back, Notley makes the crack about United Conservative leader Jason Kenney.</p>

return to "some sort of reasonable fiscal plan that isn't based on 
rainbows and unicorns."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall also doesn't like how people have surrendered the word "progressive" to the leftists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What is progressive 
about pursuing policies that don't put the economy first, that don't put
 a priority on making sure people are working? What's progressive about 
long-term deficits that are actually going to visit great pain on those 
who are most vulnerable?" Wall wouldn't be Wall if he didn't give an 
elbow to Quebec. On equalization, of course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Folks, I'm going to say this.</p>

 don't do anything that would upset la belle province."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a $19-billion 
federal program and $11.3 billion of it goes to a 400-year old economy 
in the second-most populous province in the country. There's an issue 
there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, for the record, Wall is 100% behind turning off the taps on oil to B.C. as a last resort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Alberta, you got to do this," says Wall, again pointing out the province should only do it if all else fails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As a has-been premier I'll be cheering from the sidelines."</p>

 — Alberta Premier Rachel Notley and Opposition Leader Jason Kenney 
exchanged smiles and brief waves in the Alberta legislature Monday 
before letting the accusations fly in their first question period 
together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney accused Notley of 
misleading Albertans on her carbon tax while the premier said Kenney and
 other Conservatives let down all of Canada by failing to get a <b>pipeline</b> built to tidewater while in power in Ottawa.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We
 had Conservatives in Ottawa, we had Conservatives in Edmonton (in the 
provincial government) and we had Conservatives in Victoria and they 
couldn't get a <b>pipeline</b> built," Notley told the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They had their chance and they blew it. That won't happen again."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney attacked Notley 
over the multibillion-dollar carbon tax. He noted Notley didn't campaign
 on it in the 2015 election. And he questioned its value as a good faith
 "<b>social licence</b>" gesture given that the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b> expansion to B.C., approved by Ottawa, is still facing delays from the B.C. government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"(Notley) told Albertans if we just pay more for everything somehow magically <b>pipeline</b> opponents would become <b>pipeline</b> supporters and pipelines would get built," said Kenney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As per the noisy, raucous
 parliamentary tradition, Notley's answers were met with cheers and desk
 thumping from her caucus members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney's questions and comments, however, were met with silence from his team and there was no cross-aisle heckling of Notley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney later told reporters that's how he wants it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think people who tune 
in actually want to be able to hear their legislators and what they are 
saying. Just endless, pointless background noise inhibits that," he 
said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My observation as a 
regular Albertan watching this assembly (before) was I couldn't hear 
half of what they were saying with all the thumping going on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney and the UCP caucus
 members focused on the carbon tax during question period. Kenney said 
it will be the theme during the spring sitting and up to the next 
election in the spring of 2019, and has promised to scrap the tax if he 
becomes premier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley said the tax 
helped build the moral foundation for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's 
decision to green light the Trans Mountain expansion in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley has been locked in a battle with B.C. Premier John Horgan's government over what Alberta terms delay tactics on the <b>pipeline</b>, including court challenges in an area that Notley says is clearly an area of federal responsibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Notley 
announced Alberta will consider curtailing the flow of oil if B.C. 
continues its tactics, an idea that Kenney had been touting for weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After question period, 
all sides debated a government motion to urge Ottawa take action to get 
Trans Mountain approved and to support the province in its effort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At every step along the 
way, our government has made the case to Canadians (for energy 
development and pipelines)," Notley told the house after introducing the
 motion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney has promised to elevate the decorum from his caucus the house, hence the impromptu cross-aisle wave to the premier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I intended to actually 
go over and shake her hand but then all of my guys started shouting at 
me," said Kenney. "Apparently you can't cross the floor, metaphorically 
speaking, here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I just wanted to salute 
her. At the end of the day we're going to disagree on a lot of things, 
agree on some, but we don't have to be nasty about it."</p>
