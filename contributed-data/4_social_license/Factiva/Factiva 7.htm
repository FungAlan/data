incomes, but at least unemployment shouldn't increase and inflation 
won't be out of control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All-in-all, Canada's economy will be, well, "meh."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why? Taxes and regulations, but mostly taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2015, when the 
Liberals and New Democrats took over in Ottawa and Edmonton, 
respectively, federal and provincial taxes on individuals and 
corporations have sucked much life out of our economy, along with insane
 new environmental regulations that are scaring away foreign investment 
in our energy sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, the <span class="companylink">OECD</span> also points to uncertainty about <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>. So Trump haters can blame Donald Trump's trade strategy a bit, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in recent years, federal and provincial governments have raised taxes so much that Canada has become less competitive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report, also Monday, for the Alberta government, <span class="companylink">Export Development Canada</span>, the <span class="companylink">Petroleum Services Association of Canada</span>,
 Canadian Global Exploration Forum and JWN, an energy industry media 
group, determined the best investment opportunities for Canadian <b>oil</b> companies were in ... the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How ironic. A report for 
the Alberta government and the federal government's export agency is 
encouraging Canadian companies to ship their money south.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crazy public policies are
 acting like rocks on the tail of the Canadian economic bird, changes 
such as subjecting any new energy development to "genderbased 
assessments" or making pipelines responsible for all the emissions 
created by the <b>oil</b> they carry, even emissions from the <b>oil</b> after it leaves the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But according to the <span class="companylink">OECD</span>,
 the biggest problem the Canadian economy has at the moment is taxes. We
 are raising ours rapidly while our largest trading partners, the 
Americans, have radically reduced at least their corporate taxes since 
last November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Alberta, for instance, the top corporate tax rates have increased by 50% since Premier Rachel Notley and the NDP took over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta Advantage is gone. Alberta's corporate tax rate is now as high as most other provinces'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the Harper 
government, Ottawa worked hard to make Canada's tax rates slightly lower
 than American rates. That resulted in corporate investment shifting 
northward for a decade or so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now the combination of uncompetitive tax rates, huge government deficits and "<b>social licence</b>" regulations has scared away tens of billions of investment dollars (along with the jobs those dollars would have created).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stubbornness of the 
B.C. government surrounding the Trans Mountain pipeline - and the 
unwillingness of the Trudeau Liberals to do anything strong about B.C.'s
 obstructionism - has foreign investors worried, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's one last insanity 
that is contributing to our "meh" performance: Fossil fuels brought into
 Canada are not subjected to carbon taxes or wacky environmental regs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millions of tonnes of 
U.S. coal are shipped to Asia each year through the Port of Vancouver 
without ever being charged a cent of federal or provincial carbon tax. 
The B.C. government, which is doing everything it can to stop Alberta <b>oil</b>, does nothing to limit dirtier U.S. coal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, none of the 700,000 barrels of foreign <b>oil</b> imported into Canada every day is subjected to the environmental regulations every ounce of Western Canadian <b>oil</b> must meet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why would foreign investors pump money into Canada, only to have their <b>oil</b> or coal blocked and their income taxed through the nose, when they can import fossil fuels and get around the taxes?</p>

 pundits should not be so quick to write off the new Doug Ford-Scott Moe
 alliance against the federal carbon tax. Yes, they were the only two of
 the 10 provincial premiers in New Brunswick this week to announce their
 support for a constitutional challenge to the federal law. And yes 
constitutional experts are correct in predicting that this legal 
challenge is not likely to succeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But winning in the legal 
battle does not mean winning the policy war. Obstructionist provincial 
governments can gum up federal policies whose effective implementation 
require provincial co-operation. Witness how B.C. Premier John Horgan 
and his antipipeline allies have succeeded in delaying the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline expansion despite losing 17 consecutive court decisions.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With
 respect to the carbon tax, the law may be on the side of Ottawa, but 
time and politics are not. Saskatchewan's reference to its court of 
appeal won't be decided for another nine months. Whoever loses will 
appeal to the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>, 
which will take another year or more to be heard and then decided. By 
then, there will have been a spring election in Alberta and a federal 
election in the fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Alberta, Conservative 
leader Jason Kenney is promising to scrap that province's carbon tax if 
he wins next year's election. All current polling suggests that he will.
 Manitoba has adopted its own version of a carbon tax, but the price it 
places on CO2 is below the minimum demanded by the federal plan. Premier
 Pallister has warned that if Ottawa tries to force it higher, "we'll 
see you in court." P.E.I. has adopted a climate change plan with no 
carbon tax - a policy that clearly does not meet federal regulations. 
And if anti-tax momentum builds, the Newfoundland and New Brunswick 
premiers have warned that they are not going to impose a tax on their 
voters that consumers and businesses in six or seven other provinces are
 not paying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With next year's federal 
election fast approaching, this is potential nightmare scenario for 
Trudeau and the Liberals. Do they want to make the ballot-issue a new 
tax that will make it more expensive for voters to fill up their cars, 
heat their homes and turn on their lights? Maybe this won't make any 
difference in Saskatchewan and Alberta, where the Liberals only have 
five MPs. But in Ontario - where Doug Ford just won by promising to 
scrap the tax - the Liberals have 80 MPs seeking reelection. Losing even
 a quarter of these would jeopardize their 183-seat government, which is
 only 13 over the 170 minimum required for a majority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2015, many 
centre-right voters supported Trudeau simply because they were tired of 
Stephen Harper. But in 2018, they supported Doug Ford because they were 
tired of skyrocketing electricity and gas prices. If in 2019 Trudeau 
takes a hardline on bringing back the very carbon tax that Premier Ford 
has just repealed, he risks losing some of these former supporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the alternative - 
backing off on the carbon tax - has its own risks. Promising action on 
climate change was one of the issues that helped Trudeau win in 2015. 
With the help of the U.S.-financed environmental NGO (EN-GO) Leadnow, 
the Liberals targeted 29 Conservative-held ridings in which their 
polling indicated that climate change was a priority for voters. Liberal
 candidates subsequently won 25 of these seats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these same 
centre-left voters that supported Trudeau in 2015 are no longer so happy
 with him. Many are angry about the federal government's $4.5-billion 
bailout of the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline 
expansion in B.C. If Trudeau now backs down on his national carbon tax 
pledge, many of his 2015 supporters for whom climate action is still a 
priority may drift off to the NDP in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underlying the Liberals'carbon tax dilemma is the spectacular failure of the Trudeau-Notley "<b>social licence</b>"
 gambit: their belief that in return for their various carbon reduction 
policies, climate change ENGOs would acquiesce in Canada's economic need
 to build the Kinder Morgan Trans-Mountain expansion. Whatever 
plausibility this trade-off strategy may have had initially has now been
 destroyed. The anti-Kinder Morgan forces - the Horgan government, U.S. 
and Canadian climate ENGOs and B.C. Aboriginal groups - have accelerated
 their opposition to TransMountain, not backed off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor are they shy about explaining why. When CBC asked Bill Mc-Kibben, founder of <span class="companylink">350.org</span>,
 why he would not give Trudeau and Notley any credit for Canada's carbon
 reduction policies, he stated a simple fact: that at only two per cent 
of global emissions, what Canada does on the domestic "demand" side to 
reduce our emissions is too small to make any difference. What will make
 a difference, McKibben continued, is preventing the further development
 of the Canadian <b>oil</b> sands - the third largest reserve on the world. "To stop the <b>oil</b> sands, we have to stop all pipelines."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The failure of his <b>social licence</b> strategy forced Trudeau to rescue the TransMountain expansion with the $4.5-billion purchase of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada</span>.
 This did not win him many new friends in Alberta or Saskatchewan, but 
infuriated many of his erstwhile climate change supporters in Ontario 
and British Columbia. With an election only a year away, the carbon tax 
issue threatens to push the Liberals even deeper into a political corner
 with no easy way out.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On
 March 18, 2016, Canada's Minister of Finance, Bill Morneau, established
 the Advisory Council on Economic Growth and charged it with the 
development of advice on concrete policy actions to help create the 
conditions for strong and sustained long-term economic growth. More than
 a year later, how well has the government done with that advice? If we 
look at the council's first report Bringing Foreign Investment to 
Canada, it put emphasis on the importance of attracting foreign 
investment, which is certainly a worthy goal. The report stated that 
"Foreign direct investment (FDI) is a critical driver of economic 
growth...</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
 it strengthens Canadian productive capacity through knowledge transfer,
 the development of human capital, and new technology, management 
techniques, and production processes." It recommends the establishment 
of a Foreign Direct Investment Agency, which "in its first few years of 
operation, can raise the growth rate of inbound FDI from its current two
 per cent to six per cent annually... and would add approximately $43 
billion to Canada's GDP - an amount currently equal to two per cent of 
our national income."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, what's the Liberal 
government's record to date on attracting foreign direct investment? The
 accompanying graph is worth a thousand words. It shows that, in fact, 
since 2013 the inflow of FDI fell substantially, and the pace has only 
accelerated after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government 
took office in 2015. The amount reached a low of $30 billion in 2017 and
 is likely to decrease further in 2018. The purchase by the <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span> of the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline business alone will reduce the amount by over $4 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Important also is the 
amount of FDI made by Canadians abroad, instead of being invested here 
at home. The graph shows that outflows, too, have increased steadily 
since 2011 and reached a record $100 billion in 2017. As a result, in 
that year the balance of Canada's FDI account (outflows minus inflows) 
was about negative $4 billion. A far cry from what the government had 
planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the importance of 
FDI for economic growth, these statistics make it clear we need to 
understand why this deterioration in Canada's FDI account took place. 
Some causes are developments beyond our government's control, such as 
recent reductions in U.S. corporate income tax rates and regulations, 
lower <b>oil</b> and gas prices, and the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate accord.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, much blame for this deterioration stems from recent Canadian policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As discussed recently in these pages by Jack Mintz and William Robson, and in a recent <span class="companylink">Fraser Institute</span> publication by Niels Veldhuis, Milagros Palacios and Jason Clemens, these policies worsened the investment climate in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This worsening resulted 
from the increase in environmental and climate policies such as: The 
mandated closing of coal-fired electricitygenerating plants in Ontario 
(and the rapid rise in electricity prices that followed); the capping of
 future extraction of <b>oil</b> in Alberta; and the prohibition of 
tanker traffic along the northern coast of British Columbia and of 
pipelines in B.C.'s Great Bear Rainforest. There was also the imposition
 of stricter conditions on the construction of pipelines to prevent <b>oil</b> spills and the requirement to obtain "<b>social licence</b>" before one could be built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worsening of the 
investment climate is also due to the pursuit of the "progressive" 
political agenda in vogue lately across Canada, including: Heavier 
regulation of equity policies in pay and employment; increases in 
minimum wages; and restrictions on property development and the 
imposition of more stringent building codes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most important 
element of this progressive agenda has been the increase in taxes on 
corporations and high-income individuals and the prospect of still 
higher taxes through rising carbon taxes. Since an important part of the
 cost of the progressive agenda is covered by deficits, the growing debt
 portends even higher taxes in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly politicians and 
some proportion of Canadians are certain to consider the costs of these 
policies to be worth the benefits brought by improvements in 
environmental protection, the prevention of global warming and better 
social conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upcoming federal and 
provincial elections, like the one that just decimated the Liberals in 
Ontario, will continue to reveal how prevalent this view is among 
voters.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is
 it just coincidence that relations with Western Canada become so badly 
frayed when people named Trudeau happen to be prime minister, or is it 
possible there's more to it than that? You'd have a hard time convincing
 many Albertans that Justin Trudeau is any sort of improvement over his 
deeply disliked father. The Trudeau Liberals'epic mishandling of the 
pipeline crisis - which wasn't really a crisis until they turned it into
 one - already had backs up across the province when Albertans 
discovered they'd been hoodwinked by a surprise federal move to cement 
the widelydisliked equalization program in place for another five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don Braid, the veteran 
Calgary Herald columnist not usually prone to hyperbole, reflected the 
depth of the resulting anger when he wrote that the move indicates 
"Canada is rigged."</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Rarely
 has there been a sneakier ploy than the Trudeau government's unilateral
 renewal of the current equalization system without formal notice to 
provinces or the public," Braid wrote. "Everybody involved looks either 
secretive or stupid. Except the feds, who are just sneaky, all in the 
traditional interest of refusing to change a system rigged against 
Alberta."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's anger is understandable. It has endured five years of deeply trying times as <b>oil</b>
 prices collapsed, gutting its economy, with Ottawa offering little 
beyond words in assistance. But western grievances aren't limited to a 
province that rarely welcomes Liberals in any case. Trudeau's government
 is at loggerheads with British Columbia over the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 pipeline mess, heading to a confrontation with Saskatchewan over 
Ottawa's carbon tax dictates, and facing a return to the days when you 
could fly from Ontario's border to the Pacific without crossing more 
than a handful of Liberal outposts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's notable about the 
situation is how comprehensively the Liberals have created the problems 
for themselves. If Trudeau and his top honchos had deliberately set out 
to create a pipeline problem, they couldn't have done any better. 
Trudeau claimed to support the Keystone XL project in the U.S. but paid 
little beyond lip service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When President Barack 
Obama killed it, he offered barely a murmur of complaint, noting he was 
"disappointed ... but respect(s) the right of the United States to make 
the decision." The Liberals blocked Northern Gateway, introduced a 
regulatory regime certain to confound future projects, watched Energy 
East die, and all but issued a veto to anti-<b>oil</b> activists by jabbering blithely about the importance of "<b>social licence</b>," a term you don't often hear from the embattled prime minister anymore. Ottawa only got serious about <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 when the company forced the issue; now Canadians are stuck with the 
costs, and a B.C. government that's just as adamant as ever about 
ensuring it never gets built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While fumbling that file,
 the Liberals'determination to impose a national carbon plan is showing 
every sign of backfiring. B.C.'s New Democrats have turned that 
province's existing tax into a straightforward money grab, making a 
prophet of every critic who claimed governments, no matter how 
well-meaning, would twist the plan into just another way to collect and 
spend money. By this time next year Ottawa could face premiers united 
from Ontario west in opposition to the federal scheme and willing to go 
to the mat to block it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One would think that, 
with those fissures already in place, Ottawa would be wary about opening
 another against western interests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But no. Buried deep - 
very deep - in the fine print of the latest Liberal budget was a 
paragraph indicating equalization would be extended for five years until
 2024. It was oddly worded, didn't show up until page 319 of a 369-page 
document, and evidently slipped past provincial leaders and others 
assigned to decipher Ottawa's intentions. Despite knowing both 
Saskatchewan and Alberta were preparing to argue for substantial changes
 before the program could be renewed, no consultations were offered and 
no apparent efforts made to flag the decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finance Minister Bill 
Morneau's office did write to both provinces referring to the renewal 
after the budget had already been introduced, but in terms that somehow 
failed to trigger alarm in either case. He did offer to consult on the 
next renewal, in five years, if he's still in office and the Liberals 
still in power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, technically, Ottawa 
can say its action wasn't totally secret, though considering the 
delicacy of the issue and the importance to the provinces, its handling 
was decidedly curious. In any case, slipping a fast one past a couple of
 finance ministers wasn't going to prevent the eventual outburst when 
the ruse got noticed. If anything, it was only bound to worsen the 
situation by shredding what little trust remained between western 
leaders and federal officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why do it? Are Trudeau
 and Morneau entirely tone-deaf to the West? It's not an outlandish 
suggestion. Morneau may have a respectable business record, but his 
judgment was put in serious question by last year's business tax reform 
shambles, and his personal background is rooted deeply in Ontario's 
Toronto-centric Liberal traditions. Trudeau's B.C. ties date from his 
youth as a freewheeling snowboarder and his brief teaching career; as a 
politician he's decidedly central Canadian in aspect. Of his 184 seats, 
120 are in Ontario and Quebec. He needs to perform well there next year 
to keep his job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equalization is a complex
 program that is easily misunderstood, but the fact that almost $12 
billion of its $19 billion goes to Quebec - a province that never 
hesitates to boast about its advanced nature while somehow eternally 
qualifying as a "have-not" entity - is a matter of justifiable 
frustration, especially in provinces like Alberta and Saskatchewan that 
find their resource-based economies condemn them to second-tier status, 
even in tough times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They wanted to discuss 
the program and propose some changes. Ottawa undercut them in a devious 
manner. Is it something in the Trudeau gene pool? Or just a Liberal 
party that has always struggled to see past Ontario? National Post

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 NDP is at it again. This time, pedalling the false notion that a 
rejection of their carbon tax agenda is equal to a rejection of science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These worn out talking points came last week from Steve Williams, president and CEO of Suncor.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking
 at an event in Calgary, Williams stated that "the science of the left 
wing is different that the science of the right wing," and blamed 
conservatives for dividing the public on the issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some wealthy CEOs might 
criticize us for rejecting the NDP's carbon tax, but we are on side with
 the vast majority of Albertans who are forced to bear the costs of this
 government's policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Albertans who don't 
appreciate being shamed by elites who have no trouble making ends meet 
for rejecting a policy that has wreaked havoc on household budgets 
across the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Poll after poll shows 
just how unpopular this carbon tax is, and with good reason - it hasn't 
done a thing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, it simply 
punishes Alberta consumers by increasing the cost of everything from 
heating our homes in the winter to putting gas in the vehicle that gets 
us to work each day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What it has done is drive
 emissions, along with good, mortgage-paying jobs, to jurisdictions 
without a punitive carbon tax regime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We already see energy jobs booming in places like North Dakota and Texas, while the <b>oil</b> and gas workers in Alberta remain unemployed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact of the matter is
 that Albertans were sold a false bill of goods when the NDP introduced 
its carbon tax - a tax they never campaigned on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were told that it would buy us the so-called "<b>social licence</b>" we needed to get shovels in the ground on a pipeline to tidewater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not one pipeline 
oppo-nent has become a pipeline supporter as a result of this carbon tax
 and the Trans Mountain pipeline project now hangs in the balance, 
despite the fact that taxpayers have now assumed the financial risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These opponents - the 
same ones the NDP promised would become supporters if we handcuffed our 
economy with a punitive tax on everything - are now doing everything in 
their power to block Trans Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are the elected 
officials in British Columbia that are denying permits and bringing 
progress to a standstill with an endless stream of court challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are the so-called "activists", funded by foreign anti-Alberta interests, that are illegally blocking construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not one of these opponents has been swayed by the Alberta NDP's carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, they are digging their heels in for the long haul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, rather than admit it 
was wrong, the NDP has chosen to smear every Albertan opposed to the 
carbon tax as a climate change 'denier,'a phrase deliberately intended 
to invoke Holocaust denial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone that dares challenge this government on the false logic of "<b>social licence</b>" or raise a question about carbon leakage is branded as backwards and anti-science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, I know that 
Albertans are smarter than that, and I know they do not believe for a 
minute that the only way to address climate change is through a carbon 
tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP would be wise to remember this the next time they feel an urge to insult the people they are supposed to represent.</p>

 is tunnelling a hole, currently at least 120 metres below the pine tree
 forests and lakes that dot the surface, for what it hopes will be one 
of its most sustainable mines yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borden, as the mine is to
 be called when it starts producing in 2019, will be modest in size at 
about 250,000 ounces of gold per year under current estimates.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But <span class="companylink">Goldcorp</span>
 harbours big ambitions to make it the first all-electric underground 
mine in Canada where everything from the trucks that haul ore, to the 
ventilation system that provides oxygen to its subterranean workers, run
 off energy taken from the electrical grid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All mines are finite 
projects, making them in one sense, unsustainable. Still, in an era when
 countries around the world have pledged to curb carbon emissions, many 
mining companies are citing "sustainability" as a core value and are 
making strides to limit their environmental impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Barrick Gold</span>, <span class="companylink">Endeavour Silver Corp</span>.
 and other companies released reports in the past month that sought to 
measure their "sustainability" by looking at environmental impacts, 
community relations, safety records and other metrics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With diesel prices rising in tandem with <b>oil</b> prices, the quest for sustainability also has pushed many companies to look closely at their energy usage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not just 
necessarily because of the environment," said Brent Bergeron, Goldcorp's
 executive vice-president of corporate affairs and sustainability. 
"There's very interesting financial benefits we can get by actually 
becoming smarter about how we produce and use power generation at our 
sites."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In choosing a mine to 
experiment with how to wean itself off diesel, the Borden project made 
sense, he said, because of its small size and its location in Ontario, 
where a cap-and-trade program came into effect earlier this year. The 
program sets a limit on a company's greenhouse gas emissions, above 
which they need to purchase credits at auctions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although electricity is 
expensive in Ontario, Bergeron said there is access to renewable energy 
sources such as hydro, which will lower the company's carbon footprint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside the mine itself, it is also using electric-powered 40-tonne haul trucks, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Those trucks don't exist
 yet," Bergeron said, adding that the company urged the supplier to 
build them or else the company would find a different supplier that 
could build them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also obvious benefits to switching to the grid. By using electricity for its air ventilation system, <span class="companylink">Goldcorp</span> stopped spewing diesel particulate into the air it must keep clean for its workers, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think that what you're
 seeing today is mining companies trying to really push the 
sustainability side of what we're doing," said Bergeron, "but also look 
at it from the point of view of these technologies do exist, they have 
been proven, so let's try and get them into some of our projects."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other companies cited 
additional benefits of moving their mines off diesel and onto the grid 
completely unrelated to the environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Pan American Silver Corp</span>., which 
recently released a report on its sustainability, built a 98-kilometre 
power line to connect its open pit silver gold Dolores mine in Mexico to
 the national power grid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Constructed in late 2016 
at a cost of $20 million, it has resulted in savings of about $9 million
 per year, according to spokeswoman Siren Fisekci.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located in an area of 
Mexico that has been riven by violence, possibly linked to drug cartels,
 last month, the mine temporarily closed after a decapitated body was 
found on a road near the mine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When we bring supplies 
in there, you're looking at 120 to 140 kilometre road to bring them in 
there," said Fisekci, who added that the power line allows the mine to 
operate regardless of conditions on the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some mining companies say
 energy accounts for 10 per cent of operating costs at a mine, which is 
inducement enough to look for savings through renewable energy or 
otherwise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, on another 
continent, amid the dusty, semi-arid landscape of northern Namibia in 
southern Africa, executives from Vancouver-based B2Gold Corp. stood with
 local dignitaries in early June to ring in the opening of a seven 
megawatt solar panel plant it built to help power its nearby open pit 
gold mine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built at a cost of $8.5 
million, it is expected to help the company save about 13 per cent on 
its energy usage at the open pit per year - about $16.5 million over the
 next decade or so, according to the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Bill Lytle, senior vice-president of operations for <span class="companylink">B2Gold</span>,
 acknowledged that the open pit mine would "scar the earth," but also 
noted that the mine had an estimated lifespan of about 10 years, 
depending on whether there is future exploration and other factors. 
Regardless, at the end of the mine life, the plan is to fill the pit 
with water and make it into a lake, then convert the surrounding area 
into a nature reserve, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the solar plant has a lifespan of 25 years, meaning it could outlast the mine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think all mining 
companies will tell you to some degree they're doing some sort of 
sustainability," said Lytle. "It is a requirement to maintain your <b>social licence</b> to operate."</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Canada's not even on the radar screen anymore."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to tens of 
billions of dollars of potential international investment in energy 
projects, "Canada's not even on the radar screen anymore." That's the 
bleak assessment of Rafi Tahmazian, portfolio manager at Canoe 
Financial, as told to reporters earlier this week.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They don't even care," Tahmazian said of the big <b>oil</b> companies and international fund managers who are avoiding Canada and Alberta like the plague.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tahmazian's own billion-dollar portfolio used to be invested just 30 per cent outside Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now fully 60 per cent of the assets he manages are in foreign markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is seen as too unpredictable and too hostile to business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In just three years in 
office, the added taxes, regulations and environmental evangelizing of 
the federal Liberal and provincial New Democrat governments have scared 
away as much as $100 billion in economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, some of the loss was due to the collapse in world <b>oil</b>
 prices in 2014 and 2015. But other jurisdictions that were hit with the
 same collapse have begun to recover far faster than Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Oil</b>-producing 
states in the U.S. are mostly at or above pre-collapse investment and 
production levels, for instance. Meanwhile, according to <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span>, foreign investment in Canada's energy sector dropped by another $30 billion last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2017, when most <b>oil</b>-producing regions of the world were getting back to business, Canada and Alberta saw <span class="companylink">Shell</span>, <span class="companylink">ConocoPhillips</span>, Statoil and Total pull out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, of course, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 effectively pulled out, too. It only doesn't look like they pulled out 
because Ottawa rushed in with $4.5 billion in taxpayer dollars to keep 
up the appearance that the Trans Mountain Expansion project is still a 
viable concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And this week, the <span class="companylink">Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) </span>released
 a report estimating that over the next 10 years, complying with 
environmental regulations will drive up Canadian energy companies'costs 
by another $25 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's $25 billion that 
could have gone into job creation and contracts for smaller service 
companies, equipment purchases, building construction, exploration or 
shareholders' dividends. Instead, it will go to meeting the demands of 
bureaucrats, government regulators and environmental lobbyists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is on top of an April report from Scotiabank showing that the lack of pipelines to get Canadian <b>oil</b> to ocean-going ports is costing energy companies and governments $15 billion a year in lost sales and revenues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is it any wonder that Suncor CEO Steve Williams told The <span class="companylink">Canadian Press</span> this week that despite Ottawa's buyout of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>,
 his company is no more likely to invest in big projects in Canada than 
before the buyout? "Canada is falling behind other jurisdictions in 
terms of competitiveness when it comes to government royalties, taxation
 and confidence in the regulatory system," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Into this gloomy economic picture trots the <span class="companylink">University of Alberta</span>, which Thursday awarded an honorary degree to infamous eco-activist and oilsands detractor, David Suzuki.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two things are related.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of Alberta's and 
Canada's "progressive" politicians have fallen under the spell of 
"green" activists like Suzuki. They have established policies that are 
destroying investor confidence in our energy sector in the name of 
saving the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would you invest in a 
high-cost, high-risk energy project when the federal government is 
trying to make pipeline approval contingent on gender studies and 
traditional Indigenous knowledge, as much as scientific research? Would 
you invest when the Alberta government wants to add billions in carbon 
tax to buy "<b>social licence</b>" from environmental extremists - 
licence the extremists will never grant? The "green" mentality that has 
seized our politics (and of which Suzuki is a high-profile 
representative) is exactly what is making Canada so utterly unattractive
 to investors, despite having the third-largest <b>oil</b> reserves in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's like living a nightmare.</p>

 is scepticism at the head office of one of the world’s biggest energy 
companies about whether Canada can build megaprojects on time and on 
budget, says a Canadian representative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corporation</span>
 (Sinopec), which bills itself as the world’s biggest refiner and 
second-biggest petrochemical producer, was one of China’s big three 
state-owned energy companies that invested in Canada’s <b>oil</b> and gas industry this century. The others are <span class="companylink">China National Offshore <b>Oil</b> Corporation</span> (<span class="companylink">CNOOC</span>) and <span class="companylink">PetroChina</span>.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, though, neither has attempted to build any multibillion-dollar projects here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Brian Tuffs, CEO of Sinopec Canada, took part in a panel discussion at a
 Gas Processing Association of Canada (GPAC) lunch on Wednesday. The 
subject was Canada’s natural gas future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuffs, who often travels 
to Sinopec’s Beijing office, responded to a questions about Canada’s 
competitiveness and ability to build major energy projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When I look at Beijing 
... they’re very much in a wait-and-see attitude,” he said, referring to
 perceptions about Canada’s ability to built projects — especially 
megaprojects — on time and on budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Until we actually get 
something committed, and get something completed, I think there is a lot
 of scepticism about Canada’s ability to actually execute on a project,”
 Tuffs told the well-attended Calgary event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to Canadian competitiveness, Tuffs has a fairly unique perspective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sinopec, which has about 
800,000 employees, is active in 26 countries. So Sinopec Canada’s 
proposed capital projects have to compete internally for funding against
 projects around the world. (He said Sinopec’s Canadian production is 
about 60,000-65,000 boe/d, roughly half gas and half <b>oil</b>.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I would say, speaking as
 a CEO of an entity that competes with 26 other countries for funding 
[within Sinopec], that we in Canada struggle to compete [for] capital,” 
Tuffs told the GPAC event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He sought “to dispel any 
lingering myths” about the Chinese government’s commercial priorities, 
arguing that making money doesn’t take a back seat to shipping physical 
barrels to China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our single most 
important corporate target is net free cash flow,” he said. “We want to 
have more money coming in than every last dollar that goes out. And if 
we’re successful, then that’s how we do it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When I talk to the big 
guys over in Beijing, they’ll say, ‘Look Brian, we don’t need 
necessarily for you to provide barrels to China. Make us money. If we 
have money, the world will sell us [<b>oil</b>].’”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: “We operate on a
 100 per cent commercial basis. And we compete internationally against 
all those other international projects.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuffs has witnessed 
China’s fast-paced conversion to natural gas as the government strives 
to improve notoriously bad air quality in cities such as Beijing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He believes Canada, with its vast gas resources and tiny domestic demand, has a “tremendous opportunity.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have a federal 
government which, broadly speaking, would like to build stronger trade 
relations with countries such as China. We share a common Pacific 
coastline with Southeast Asia. So we should be the favoured supplier of 
natural gas to those new markets.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it has to be able to compete on cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think, though, when we look at competitiveness, it’s not just about getting a <b>social licence</b> to do our work. It’s about having a cost structure which is competitive,” Tuffs said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“At the moment, when we 
look at our markets, our traditional market in the Lower 48. ... We’re 
at the wrong end of the pipeline to supply the U.S. We’re competing 
against gas from Texas [and] Louisiana.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in global gas 
markets, Canada’s first LNG export project will have to compete with 
expansions at existing LNG projects — and brownfield projects have a 
cost advantage over greenfield projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There’s no premium that a
 buyer is going to pay for a methane molecule that comes from Canada. 
They’re not going to pay extra because we’ve got a little Maple Leaf or a
 polar bear on our methane,” Tuffs said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What the international 
markets care about is cost and reliability of supply. And those are the 
only two things that as a buyer of LNG, [including] Sinopec, cares 
about. How cheap can I get it? And how reliable is the source?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy costs are 
especially important to China because this key input affects the supply 
costs of the country’s entire industrial chain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If their energy costs go
 too high, then their manufacturing cost becomes too high, and they 
become uncompetitive,” Tuffs said. “And [if] the economy of China 
stalls, [it] has implications ... for the global economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So we need to look at the competitiveness of our cost structure as well as actually getting a <b>social licence</b>.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Susannah Pierce, external relations director of the proposed Kitimat, 
B.C. LNG Canada export project, also stressed the importance of being 
able to compete on cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Royal Dutch Shell plc</span>-led project, which is expected to decide this year on whether to proceed, would be built from scratch at a greenfield site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Most of the other parts 
of the world where we’re competing already have a lot of capital 
infrastructure in the ground,” Pierce told the GPAC lunch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She emphasized the LNG industry is extremely capital intensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are dealing with 
competitors — whether that be the U.S. Gulf Coast [or] Australia [or] 
Qatar — which really are all about expansion. And as we know, expansions
 are less capital intensive, for the most part.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTERRE UPDATES LITIGATION FOR QUEBEC ASSETS; ANNOUNCES SPUD OF KAKWA NORTH WELL</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questerre Energy Corp</span>. has provided an update on the status of legal proceedings related to its assets in Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pursuant to a letter of 
intent with a senior exploration and production company to acquire its 
Quebec assets (LOI), as reported on June 4, 2018, on closing of the 
transaction, both parties will release each other from all claims 
related to the outstanding litigation. In the interim, the parties 
anticipate entering into a standstill agreement to postpone all actions 
and toll any other litigation to allow for closing of the transaction. 
In preparation for trial, the company recently obtained an independent 
assessment of its damages that are estimated to range between 
$49.7-million and $243-million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company also reported
 that the first well on its Kakwa North acreage, the 16-29-063-06W6M 
well, spudded late last week. The well is programmed with a lateral of 
approximately 2,800 metres. Questerre holds a royalty interest in the 
16-29 well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questerre Energy</span> is leveraging its 
expertise gained through early exposure to shale and other 
non-conventional reservoirs. The company has base production and 
reserves in the tight <b>oil</b> Bakken/Torquay of southeast 
Saskatchewan. It is bringing on production from its lands in the heart 
of the high-liquids Montney shale fairway. It is a leader on <b>social licence</b> to operate issues for its Utica shale gas discovery in the St. Lawrence Lowlands in Quebec.</p>

Mr. Michael Binnion reports</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTERRE SETTLES LAWSUIT AND CONSOLIDATES QUEBEC POSITION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questerre Energy Corp</span>. has executed a 
letter of intent with a senior exploration and production company to 
settle outstanding litigation and acquire all its assets in the St. 
Lawrence Lowlands, Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, president and chief executive officer of Questerre, 
commented: "On closing, we will gain operatorship of our acreage in the 
lowlands. We will be in a much better position to communicate directly 
with municipalities and address local concerns and acceptability. Our 
approach is that good relationships with local communities comes first 
and development second.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We will continue our 
step-by-step approach of working with the government and municipalities.
 This project will proceed by adequately addressing their concerns and 
making sure they participate in the benefits. We are confident that, 
with success, this project will help Quebec greatly reduce its 
hydrocarbon import problem and meet its 2030 energy policy targets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pursuant to the LOI, 
Questerre will acquire the exploration rights to 753,000 net acres in 
the lowlands, associated wells and equipment, geological and geophysical
 data, and other miscellaneous assets. Upon closing of the transaction, 
both parties will release each other from all claims related to the 
outstanding litigation. Other consideration including cash and the 
security required for the assumption of abandonment and reclamation 
liabilities (A&amp;R liabilities) is approximately $16.1-million in 
aggregate. Questerre may post a letter of credit as security for the 
A&amp;R liabilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Closing of the 
transaction is subject to the enactment by the Ministry of Energy and 
Natural Resources in Quebec of the following regulations: (i) the 
regulation respecting petroleum exploration, production and storage in a
 body of water; (ii) the regulation respecting petroleum exploration, 
production and storage on land; and (iii) the regulation respecting 
petroleum exploration, production and storage licences, and pipeline 
construction or use authorization. The company anticipates the final 
regulations could be published around the end of the second quarter of 
this year. Additional conditions to closing include the execution of a 
purchase and sale agreement.</p>

 Fellow at the School of Public Policy at the University of Calgary and a
 former minister of finance and energy in the government of Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's decision to buy out <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s
 pipeline interest is best understood as making the best of a very bad 
situation, but a situation that he is responsible for creating.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's be clear: A federally owned pipeline is hardly what anyone wanted. But it's better than no pipeline at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost all growth in global <b>oil</b>
 demand in the next 20 years – and it's big, a 30-per-cent increase – 
will be in Asia. New access to export markets other than the United 
States is critical if Canada is to stop selling our <b>oil</b> at huge 
discounts. It's time to keep that money here – along with the private 
sector jobs and government revenues that it creates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.C. Premier John Horgan's death-by-delay strategy was working against <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 because for a private company, time is money – their money. But it 
won't work against Ottawa. Ottawa has lots of time and lots of money – 
other people's money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals' hope is 
that the futility of further delaying tactics will be so obvious that 
the B.C. government will abandon their rope-a-dope strategy. Or if they 
don't, one or two defections and/or several recall elections will force 
Mr. Horgan's minority government into a non-confidence vote and a new 
election sooner rather than later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But beyond that, there's 
nothing positive about Tuesday's announcement. It was an 11th-hour 
government bailout of a privately funded pipeline project that had met 
all the requirements for approval. Will that inspire investor confidence
 going forward? Hardly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How was the $4.5-billion 
purchase price arrived at? With Mr. Trudeau – or his emissary, the poor 
Finance Minister Bill Morneau – on his knees in Houston, begging. By 
April of this year, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> 
understood that Mr. Trudeau and Canada needed the Trans Mountain 
expansion much more than they did. The Prime Minister had 
single-handedly destroyed all of Canada's other options to reach new 
export markets – first Northern Gateway, then Energy East.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All that was left was Trans Mountain. Did <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 price gouge on the purchase price? Of course. And why shouldn't they, 
given what has happened – or rather, not happened – in the past year?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The point is that it should never have reached this stage. By January of last year, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> had met every requirement of both the federal <span class="companylink">National Energy Board (NEB) </span>process and B.C.'s five conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what's been going on 
for the past 15 months? Some will point to the May, 2017, election of 
the NDP minority government in B.C. and their pledge to “use every tool 
in the toolbox" to block the Trans Mountain expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, the B.C. election 
was a proximate cause, but the deeper, formal cause has been Mr. 
Trudeau's own public rhetoric on climate change. From Paris onward, he 
has aided and abetted the antipipeline movement by repeating the 
climate-change militants' own dogmas, stigmatizing Canada's <b>oil</b> 
and gas industry and undermining the reputation of the NEB. All of this 
has legitimated and emboldened the very groups that are now trying to 
block the Trans Mountain expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the one positive to come out of all of this is that we won't have to listen to any more nonsense about <b>social licence</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposition that 
imposing carbon taxes, closing down coalfired electricity and 
subsidizing renewables would turn pipeline opponents into pipeline 
supporters has failed completely. Try to name one convert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or listen to U.S. environmentalist Bill McKibben of <span class="companylink">350.org</span> or our own climate-change wizard, David Suzuki. Both are adamant that all <b>oil</b> sands <b>oil</b> must stay in the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trudeau has been 
speaking out of both sides of his mouth since he was elected, and now it
 has caught up with him. In Paris, he paraded as the Prince of Climate 
Change. When he was in Houston, he was a champion for export pipelines. 
He wanted it both ways, but now he can't: He owns a pipeline and has 
promised to complete it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To do this, he will have 
to go to battle with the very groups that supported him in the 2015 
election – urban climate-change activists, Indigenous communities and 
maybe Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile Mr. Trudeau's 
new, erstwhile allies in this battle – Alberta, Saskatchewan, the energy
 sector and other business interests – did not support him in 2015 and, 
for the reasons discussed above, are no more likely to support him in 
2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the next election 
only 17 months away, the Liberals are in trouble and they know it. Mr. 
Trudeau is the architect of his party's demise. But the rest of us will 
have to pay for it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">HTC PURENERGY INC</span>. ANNOUNCES UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER PERIOD ENDING MARCH 31, 2018</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">HTC Purenergy Inc</span>. has released its unaudited condensed consolidated financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HTC Purenergy and its 
subsidiaries have chosen to refocus its business units in the 
environmental technologies sector. The acceptance of climate change and 
the <b>social licence</b> that corporations are moving toward are upon 
the company in force. Carbon footprint and the capture and management of
 CO2 (carbon dioxide) has become effectively a currency of business, a 
vehicle for penalty and taxation, and a statement to shareholders who 
expect environmental responsibility from the companies they invest in. 
The company notes that all segments of the energy sector must contribute
 and, as such, the management of CO2 from combustion-fired plants can be
 used not only to reduce emissions, but also to improve <b>oil</b> production through the use of enhanced <b>oil</b>
 recovery (EOR) techniques. HTC has focused its efforts in this area 
over the past few years, as EOR provides an immediate economic benefit 
to an <b>oil</b> company (in addition to being able to meet its <b>social licence</b> responsibilities).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The natural gas industry 
has taken on a new challenge of gas cleanup of CO2, SO2 (sulphur 
dioxide) and other contaminants, while ensuring that the solvents and 
the glycols that are used in the cleanup process are recycled and 
reused, and providing a significant cost reduction to the customer at 
the same time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HTC's delta purification 
division is showing promising results, as the energy industry and many 
larger industrial companies have joined the "re3" revolution: reclaim, 
recycle and reuse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tertiary <b>oil</b> 
production business requires a significant amount of water for 
production of steam and, at the same time, a significant capital cost to
 install traditional heavy <b>oil</b> production technologies. Assist 
Energy Solutions Corp.'s SCV technology allows the use of brackish 
production water (that normally would have to be disposed of or treated)
 to be used as steam for energy production. The SCV technology also 
allows the heavy <b>oil</b> producer to bring existing non-producing 
wells back on-line with a minimal investment in capital costs. "Reclaim,
 recycle and reuse" is more than a tag line for the company. The company
 is a world leader delivering technology in this solvent and glycol 
sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial results</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Selected financial 
information of HTC is summarized in the attached table. Financial 
results for HTC have been prepared in accordance with international

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the period, the 
company had revenue of $21,884 ($114,300 for the quarter ended March 31,
 2017). The decrease in revenue is due to fewer sales in Maxx Group of 
Companies Corp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the period, HTC had 
expenses of $690,179, compared with $938,346 for the quarter ended March
 31, 2017. The decrease of $249,167 is primarily due to a decrease of 
costs of sales of $102,837, due to nature of services provided versus 
products sold in the prior year, a decrease in commercialization, 
product development and administrative expenses of $148,528, and other 
sundry variances between periods. Decreased costs are mainly due to 
reduced Maxx and Maxx subsidiaries activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Net loss for the period 
was $229,663, compared with a net loss of $476,425 as at March 31, 2017.
 The reduced loss is primarily due to decreased operating expenses and 
increased income from equity investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comprehensive loss for 
the period is $159,086, compared with a comprehensive loss of $613,620 
at March 31, 2017. The loss reduction is attributable to net income and 
the change in unrealized gain on investments classified as available for

 Minister Justin Trudeau took the stage on Tuesday evening at The Globe 
and Mail Centre in Toronto hours after his government announced a deal 
to acquire the Trans Mountain pipeline, and was introduced as “Canada's 
newest <b>oil</b> baron."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trudeau took the joke
 in stride, responding that his grandfather owned gas stations, so 
perhaps it's appropriate his government is dropping $4.5-billion to take
 over the controversial energy project from <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Inc</span>.
 If the Prime Minister can duplicate his grandfather's track record, 
taxpayers will do just fine out of the Trans Mountain deal.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Trudeau needs to get his timing right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charles-Émile Trudeau, a 
lawyer by training, spent the 1920s acquiring gas stations around 
Montreal, then sold the chain of 30 outlets to <span class="companylink">Imperial <b>Oil</b></span>
 in 1932 for $1-million - and as they say, that was when a million was 
worth something. That investment formed the base of the family's 
fortune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal Liberals bought Trans Mountain to fulfill their commitment to get Alberta <b>oil</b>
 to the British Columbia coast after its Houston-based owner threw in 
the towel on plans to triple the pipeline's capacity in the face of 
fierce political and public resistance, especially in B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government is already trying to find a willing buyer to take Trans Mountain off its hands. Investment bank <span class="companylink">Greenhill &amp; Co</span>.
 has been hired to pitch the project to everyone from pension-fund 
bosses to private-equity investors to pipeline companies. But the timing
 is off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No private company will 
be willing to go near Trans Mountain when the fate of the project 
remains in doubt. As long as environmentalists and other opponents 
believe they can stop the pipeline, its owner will be a political 
target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No chief executive wants 
to associate the corporate brand with scenes of pipeline protesters 
being led away in handcuffs, or deal with endless court challenges from 
B.C.'s NDP government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So for now, the pipeline 
can't be flipped. The challenge for Ottawa - and Bay Street - is 
figuring out how much of the longpromised pipeline expansion must be 
built before the perceived risks begin to drop away and buyers step up 
with attractive offers. Opinions on this are all over the map.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The head of one 
investment bank, speaking anonymously because his firm desperately wants
 to work for a future buyer, told me the Liberals will not get full 
value for Trans Mountain until the project is 100-per-cent done, with <b>oil</b> flowing into tankers in Vancouver harbour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His second-in-command, in
 the same conversation, insisted there would be a lineup of buyers at 
30-per-cent complete. This banker said heavyweight U.S. investors such 
as <span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway Inc</span>., which already has significant stakes in Canadian utilities, and <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> would be potential bidders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bankers are also working on plans to help Trans Mountain win an elusive <b>social licence</b> by selling the project to a consortium of public sector pension plans with solid environmental credentials, including the <span class="companylink">British Columbia Investment Management Corp</span>. It's worth noting that the country's biggest fund, the <span class="companylink">Canada Pension Plan Investment Board</span>, said on Tuesday that it is “not actively assessing an investment in the extension opportunity."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That language is telling. The message from CPPIB is: We're not interested now, but call us when the noise dies down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bright minds on Bay Street are also working on solutions to the problems that drove away <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>. If First Nations groups are raising concerns about the pipeline, bring them in as co-owners, as <span class="companylink">Suncor Energy Inc</span>. did by partnering with the Fort McKay and Mikisew Cree First Nations on a recent $500million investment in an Alberta <b>oil</b> storage facility. Canadian banks might be able to provide the financing to make those investments possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Infrastructure assets 
such as pipelines, and the dependable cash they kick off, are currently 
hot investments. If Mr. Trudeau can do as his grandfather did and build a
 business that supplies energy to customers who need ever-increasing 
amounts of fuel, Trans Mountain will have no shortage of buyers. But the
 government needs to reduce the risks before those investors emerge.</p>

 -- MONTREAL - To understand the counterintuitive political calculus 
behind Justin Trudeau's controversial decision to buy the Trans Mountain
 pipeline, one has to go back to the fundamental equation that has 
governed this prime minister's energy and climate change policies since 
his days in opposition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That Trudeau had no 
choice but to take over the pipeline if he wanted to ensure that the 
plan for its expansion did not die on the drawing board is not in 
question. By the time Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced the 
federal decision Tuesday, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> - the pipeline's parent company - was about to pull the plug on the project.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But
 the real question is why would the Liberal government be willing to put
 an open-ended amount of political and financial capital on the line to 
keep it alive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If one connects the dots 
between most major policies that past governments have deemed to be in 
the national interest, one almost always finds they conveniently 
intersected with a ruling party's election prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Stephen Harper's decision to bail out the auto industry in 2009 was not 
unrelated to the fact that his path to a coveted majority government ran
 through Ontario. His conversion to deficit financing at the time of the
 global economic crisis was a deathbed one, at least in part dictated by
 the need to survive confidence votes in the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by that measure, Trudeau's Trans Mountain move is an outlier. The electoral math does not add up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the face of it, the 
prime minister has at best shored up half a dozen Liberal seats in the 
Prairies at the cost of potentially putting in play at least triple that
 number across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along the way, Trudeau 
has put himself on a collision course with many Indigenous 
constituencies, and he has destroyed his international reputation as a 
climate change-crusader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the stakes, the 
prime minister's pipeline gamble has even been compared to Brian 
Mulroney's decision to roll the dice in his relentless quest for 
constitutional reconciliation with Quebec in the early 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mulroney had a 
compelling incentive to stick with the constitutional file to the bitter
 end. After the Meech Lake accord failed, he could not have let it go 
without risking his governing majority as the result of defections to 
the nascent Bloc Québécois and without fuelling support for Quebec 
secession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is an economic case
 to be made for ensuring the Trans Mountain pipeline is completed. Of 
the projects designed to link the Alberta oilfields to tidewater that 
were on the drawing board when Trudeau became prime minister, it is the 
only one that is still actively pursued. Until the last B.C. election, 
it was also considered the most likely to get to completion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Trans Mountain 
expansion has also become as politically indispensable to Trudeau's 
agenda - at least in the mind of its Liberal overseers - as it may be to
 Canada's <b>oil</b> industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was always meant to be
 the poster project for the federal contention that it is possible to 
balance Canada's energy ambitions with a more aggressive approach to 
mitigating climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Trudeau came to 
power, the emphasis has been the part of the equation that involves 
putting a price on carbon pollution as a necessary step to earn a social
 license for a pipeline projects such as Trans Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Liberal government believes the flipside of the equation - that a <b>social licence</b> for a carbon tax cannot be sustained if it is earned on the back of Alberta's energy industry - to be just as essential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allowing the Trans 
Mountain expansion to die this week would have cost Trudeau the support 
of Alberta's NDP government for his national climate change framework. 
Back in March, Premier Rachel Notley tied meeting Ottawa's carbon tax 
targets to the future of the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking to next year's 
federal election, the demise of the Trans Mountain expansion would have 
meant giving opponents of Trudeau's carbon pricing strategy - starting 
with the federal Conservatives - a prime exhibit in their prosecution of
 the havoc they argue his policy will wreak on the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As so it is that while 
Trudeau is widely portrayed as having picked the polluters' side in the 
climate-change debate, the Liberals will argue that they have done what 
they needed to do to continue to advance a pro-environment agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only time will tell 
whether this government has trapped itself in an intricate web of 
twisted logic. If so, as of this week's Trans Mountain announcement 
Trudeau is unlikely to untangle himself from that web in time for next 
year's election.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa
 wants us to believe that its nationalization of the Trans Mountain 
pipeline is yet further evidence of its commitment to a project it has 
repeatedly described as in the national interest. Instead, this decision
 shows the total bankruptcy of the government's approach to pipelines; 
that policy's failure is now so total that the government is signalling 
it accepts that no private investor can be expected to bear the risks 
associated with pipeline construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finance Minister Bill 
Morneau's "don't worry, be happy" approach relies on saying there are 
plenty of investors who will be prepared to take the pipeline off 
Ottawa's hands once it is built. But the last four words of the previous
 sentence tell the entire story. The construction phase is the one that 
carries the highest vulnerability and danger of failure. Once in the 
ground and operating, the pipeline's risks, while far from zero, are 
acceptable to the private sector.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let
 us not lose sight, however, of the fact that, according to the Canadian
 Encyclopedia, there are 840,000 kilometres of pipeline operating in 
Canada today. Pretty much all of this hugely impressive network has been
 constructed using private capital that was effortlessly deployed by 
investors who saw in Canada a country with an intelligently designed and
 applied regulatory framework and an unshakeable commitment to the rule 
of law. That reputation now lies in tatters and we now learn that only 
the government, using captive taxpayers as bankers, can complete this 
project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor is the 
nationalization of Trans Mountain the only evidence of the failure of 
this government's pipeline policy. Cast your mind back to the moment the
 Trudeau government arrived in office. Leaving aside Keystone XL, there 
were three major pipeline proposals to bring Canadian <b>oil</b> to 
tidewater: Trans Mountain, Northern Gateway and Energy East. The 
Liberals had courted the environmental vote with promises that the 
permission of affected communities would be sought and obtained (i.e. "<b>social licence</b>")
 for such projects. In exchange for that local acquiescence, the 
Liberals were willing to offer a panoply of measures designed to 
reassure Canadians that pipelines met the highest standards. New 
regulatory burdens and standards, carbon taxes and, in collaboration 
with Alberta, emissions caps for the oilsands were all enacted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of this new burden 
was used to kill one of the three projects, Enbridge's Northern Gateway,
 thanks to offshore tanker bans and forbidding the routing of any 
pipeline through the so-called Great Bear Rainforest. The fact that 
Enbridge had spent over $1 billion on its proposal, had been granted 
permission under the law to proceed and was prepared to spend billions 
more of private investors' money, were not to be allowed to interfere 
with the government's virtue signalling. One down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next came the withdrawal of <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>
 Pipeline's Energy East project. The government at the time liked to put
 about the fiction that this was some kind of commercial decision by the
 company whereas the innocent government stood ready to support the 
project if it proceeded. Independent observers, however, are virtually 
unanimous in seeing the increased regulatory burden and political 
uncertainty (especially in Quebec) as having killed the project. Far 
from promising nationalization, the government heaved a sigh of relief. 
Two down, again dragging many hundreds of millions in private investors'
 capital with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That leaves Trans 
Mountain, what former federal cabinet minister Brian Tobin might have 
referred to as the one last, lonely, unattractive, little pipeline 
clinging by its fingernails. Ottawa hopes nationalization of the project
 will send a signal of a resolute government determined to see this 
through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the contrary, though, 
this decision will be seen by foreign investors as an admission of 
weakness, not a sign of strength. Ottawa is essentially saying that such
 infrastructure, previously built by private capital under known rules 
and under the protection of the law, is now being built in an atmosphere
 in Canada that is so hostile and unwelcoming that it no longer expects 
private investors to shoulder the risk. Considering that one half of all
 business investment intentions in Canada derive from the 
capital-intensive natural resource sector, the negative fallout is 
potentially huge for future living standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not lost on those 
who build and invest in pipelines that on the day the decision was 
announced to buy Trans Mountain, the media were full of reports that 
Green Party Leader Elizabeth May was proudly paying a $1,500 fine for 
criminal contempt for having defied a court order not to obstruct the 
project's progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Count on hundreds, if not
 thousands more, following in her footsteps along the Trans Mountain 
route, assuming that legal challenges by B.C. and First Nations can be 
overcome. The Liberals are about to reap the <b>social licence</b> whirlwind whose seeds they helped to sow.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial indemnification, which most Canadians opposed, was not enough to entice <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 to stay in the game because Trudeau could not guarantee a definitive 
legal result, a co-operative B.C. government or social peace. Therefore,
 he could not preclude lengthy delays. Nor could he prevent a 
reputational hit to the company when Aboriginal elders and environmental
 activists carry signs (before soldiers cart them off to jail) decrying 
how <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> is threatening the 
B.C. coast. Capital is scarce and the company has investment 
alternatives that do not pose comparable risks. Now Trudeau must summon 
the fortitude to confront all those challenges and enforce the rule of 
law, or construction will be blocked indefinitely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government had to buy
 TMX because the project is crucial to Canada's economic prospects and 
national unity. Otherwise, our proven <b>oil</b> reserves, the 
third-largest in the world, would be effectively landlocked. However, 
Trudeau devoted the previous two-and-a-half years crowing about his 
green bonafides here and around the world. It has to be excruciating for
 him to nationalize a pipeline transporting diluted bitumen from the 
oilsands across British Columbia to Vancouver where workers will be 
confronted by irate protesters decrying his stunning betrayal. If it 
does not leave his environmental legacy in tatters it will, at the 
minimum, tarnish it irrevocably. Also, nationalization clearly signals 
that Canada was unable to retain or attract private-sector capital for a
 major resource project. Public money may address Trans Mountain, but 
resource development generally is in considerable doubt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the finance minister
 hightailed it down to Houston to meet Richard Kinder, his bargaining 
power was exceptionally weak. Kinder, doubtless frustrated by roadblocks
 and $1 billion in sunk cost, knew Morneau had run out of options, since
 his government burned the other two possibilities - Northern Gateway 
with a direct rejection and Energy East with regulatory impediments. 
Furthermore, the new Impact Assessment Act made it untenable for anyone 
to propose a major pipeline. Not surprisingly, Canada is viewed around 
the globe as a resource-rich country that literally cannot deliver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furthermore, this 
decision does not eliminate the possibility the project becomes bogged 
down in court challenges or civil disobedience, with no end in sight. 
Also, there are no guarantees private investors will show up in the 
intermediate term, if ever. In spite of initial support, a skeptical 
public may come to consider open-ended risk to be a very bad deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morneau has suggested our pensions funds, including the <span class="companylink">Canada Pension Plan Investment Board</span>,
 might be interested in investing in the project. The politicization of 
our national pension fund would undermine public confidence in the 
safety of our savings. Instead, pension fund managers will weigh TMX 
against alternative opportunities with less uncertainty, or politically 
risky projects with considerably higher returns. The Feds will have to 
assure a healthy profit before a pension fund or private sector investor
 commits billions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal legislation will 
not help. Senate Bill S-245 declared TMX a work "for the general 
advantage of Canada." While the House could pass that Bill, our 
legislators know it will not substantively add to federal jurisdiction, 
so it is pure showboating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this is a colossal 
political failure, which the prime minister will attempt to spin into an
 accomplishment. Even those who support the pipeline are worried about 
public ownership, government playing favourites, the open-ended cost to 
taxpayers and regulatory impediments that mean death by delay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fence sitting, obstruction and vacuous sloganeering have come to naught for the prime minister who pretended he could achieve a <b>social licence</b>
 by promoting both environmental protection and resource development. 
Consensus was always a naïve delusion. Now the government will have to 
muscle it through over entrenched opposition. It did not have to come to
 this, but when Trudeau promised to reconcile the irreconcilable, 
something had to give. The give is that taxpayers just bought a pipeline
 no one else wanted.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So you've bought yourself a pipeline, eh? Here are a few things to know about it:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The original route is 65 years old</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's 1150 km long.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First opened in 1953, the pipeline has run pretty well over its history, though it's averaged just over a leak a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heck, there was one on Sunday in Kamloops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What does your $4.5 billion get you</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, now you get the 
pipeline. You get the attached pumping stations, terminals and storage 
tanks. You got some pretty fancy signage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh and you get, by proxy,
 a whole swath of protesters. They're free, though. Of course, you may 
have to pay a bunch of cops to keep them away from your new employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then again, as you're 
hoping, maybe you'll find a private buyer for the whole thing by August.
 Just get that construction rolling!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Really? I can find a buyer?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business analysts point out that a pipeline is a pretty safe asset: a predictable stream of revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's <b>oil</b> going in at one end and coming out at the other, ready to be sold. You get paid for the transport. Pretty straightforward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so, you figure someone will want to pay for that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, you are still are going to have spend another $7 billion - at least</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You do have to build the 
new pipeline, which will run along the old right of way. This 
construction cost is on top of the $4.5 billion you just spent. <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> says they've already spent $1 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They figure to finish the expansion project will cost at least another $7 billion and maybe more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at the end of the day, you'll have tripled the capacity of the old pipe. Smooth business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just how much is $4.5 billion?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, the population of 
Canada at the last census was 36.29 million people. That works out to 
each of us owning about $125 worth of the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's really not too much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do you need permission from communities?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or just the courts?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the 2015 federal 
election Justin Trudeau and the Liberals insisted: "While governments 
grant permits for resource development, only communities can grant 
permission."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau even declared that while standing on the shore of English Bay. <b>Social licence</b> is the now-well-known term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One year later, in 
September 2016, the Trudeau government government tabled a document in 
the House of Commons that made no mention of the need for communities to
 provide permission. A statement from Resource Minister Jim Carr's 
office now defined <b>social licence</b> as "ensuring public confidence in the decision-making for major resource projects."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So? Which is it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's this about a court battle?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The B.C. government has 
launched a reference case at the B.C. Court of Appeal over whether the 
province has jurisdiction under the Constitution Act to regulate the 
transport of <b>oil</b> through its territory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A B.C. win would be very bad news for the pipeline and especially for prospects of a future sale to private investors.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian taxpayers, conscripted by Trudeau, have now assumed all of the risk from Houston-based <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>,
 which halted work on the pipeline last month, threatening to abandon 
the project by May 31, because it was too financially risky to proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This given the court

environmental radicals who want to kill it at all costs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trudeau government 
said it will sell the pipeline back to the private sector once it's 
completed and economically advantageous to do so. Right. We'll see.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, will it even be 
possible, given this precedent, to build any future inter-provincial 
pipelines in Canada without federal ownership, as opposed to the United 
States, where Barack Obama boasted during his presidency that his 
administration had approved enough pipelines to more than encircle the 
earth? This despite Obama's hypocritical veto of the Keystone XL 
pipeline to move Alberta's <b>oil</b> to the U.S. Gulf Coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe, now that U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Donald Trump has lifted that veto, Trudeau will buy it with our money, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why has our 
self-described "green" PM, who used to babble about "phasing out" the 
oilsands, ended up buying a pipeline to ship oilsands <b>oil</b> to 
British Columbia and the world? Because once he was elected in 2015, he 
was confronted by the fact that our economy is losing $15 billion 
annually having to sell almost all of our <b>oil</b> to the U.S. at a huge discount, since we have no way to get it to global markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau's purchase of the
 Trans Mountain pipeline project delighted Alberta NDP Premier Rachel 
Notley, who will be contributing $2 billion to the pipeline's costs, if 
needed, from Albertans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What all this shows is 
the abject failure of Trudeau's and Notley's superficial and absurd 
belief that imposing a national carbon price on Canadians would give 
them the "<b>social licence</b>" to build the Trans Mountain pipeline, with the blessings of B.C.'s anti-<b>oil</b> government, Indigenous objectors and radical environmentalists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exactly none of that has

dollars of taxpayers'money are now at risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bad enough that people

 from <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> to ensure the controversial expansion of an Alberta-to-B.C. crude <b>oil</b> pipeline gets built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price tag is less 
than the company's estimated $7.4-billion projected cost but taxpayers 
will be on the hook for $4.5 billion according to details released by 
Finance Minister Bill Morneau and Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr at
 a news conference Tuesday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa will take over the expansion and the existing pipeline and assets in a deal that will see <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 immediately begin construction. But Ottawa will immediately seek new 
buyers in the private sector and has promised to also extend insurance 
to them for any politically-motivated delays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal ensures construction that was suspended April 8 by <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s
 jittery investors will now begin immediately under the ownership of a 
Crown corporation, with plans for the federal government to seek other 
investors to soon take it over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morneau said Ottawa is buying <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s
 existing pipeline, and the rights and assets associated with the 
planned expansion, calling $4.5 billion a "fair price" for a project 
with "significant commercial value." But $4.5 billion won't cover the 
future construction costs. Morneau said those would be covered on a 
"user pay" basis but he did not specify how much that tab could run to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indigenous groups, pension funds and others have already expressed interest in buying in, said Morneau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In order to entice 
investors, Ottawa will also extend its promise to insure any other 
investors against politically-motivated delays, or future losses in the 
courts. Morneau said that if any new owner cannot ensure the project is 
built on time, the government's indemnity promise includes the 
possibility of the federal government buying back the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On his way into the 
cabinet meeting Tuesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was tight-lipped 
about the risks of his pipeline plan to taxpayers or the environment, 
saying only that “we're going to get that pipeline built.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau's options 
included buying a partial equity stake as Alberta's provincial NDP 
government also offered to do, taking over the project outright to build
 it then sell it to other investors, or buying it from <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> and flipping it quickly to other interested investors to build it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau and Morneau had already offered to “indemnify” or insure <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>, a company with headquarters in Houston, against unexpected costs due to delays caused by the B.C. government's litigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.C. Premier John Horgan,
 whose minority government is propped up by the Green Party, promised to
 use all tools to stop the pipeline expansion or dramatically reduce the
 amount of heavy crude it would send to Vancouver's coastal waters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> told Ottawa publicly two 
weeks ago that it “appreciated” Morneau's offer to cover its losses, but
 the two sides were not “in alignment.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, it was clearly not enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau believes the only
 way to ensure that construction gets underway immediately and the 
project's 2020 completion deadline is met was for Ottawa to step in now 
because the federal government is best placed to confront the B.C. 
government's court challenge that seeks to assert provincial 
jurisdiction to block it in the name of coastal water protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In spite of opposition by
 some Indigenous groups and environmentalists in B.C., Trudeau has 
declared the pipeline expansion a vital strategic interest for the 
country — one that will create tens of thousands of jobs in B.C. and 
Alberta, and ensure Alberta's <b>oil</b> sands exports are no longer sold at a discount mainly to U.S. refineries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau pegged that as a $15-billion annual hit to the Canadian economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morneau insists the 
twinning of the pipeline even in face of opposition by B.C.'s NDP 
government is a “commercially viable” project, and that there are 
“plenty” of other investors interested in it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But just as important to 
Trudeau's government is the fact a guarantee of the pipeline's expansion
 is the key to the Alberta government's participation in his climate 
change plans for a national carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau's Environment 
Minister Catherine McKenna has linked the two as well, but on Tuesday 
morning she said nothing to reporters as she walked straight-faced into 
cabinet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The irony of Trudeau — who said pipeline projects need “<b>social licence</b>” to proceed and has championed consultation with Indigenous people— buying an <b>oil</b>
 pipeline in the name of the global fight against greenhouse gases, is 
just as eyebrow-raising as former Conservative prime minister Stephen 
Harper's bailout of two auto giants during the 2009 global financial 
crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It raises the political stakes for Trudeau as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morneau says the federal 
government has clear jurisdiction over the interprovincial movement of 
Canada's natural resources, and it would have been impossible for a 
private sector company to end a dispute that is between two governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some critics believe, however, that the project is unlikely to be the saviour for Canadian exports, and that <b>oil</b> is still just as likely to be shipped to U.S. west coast refineries and from there sold to Asia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the federal NDP opened a new front in its own opposition to the project by painting <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 as a Canadian corporate tax dodger, telling the Commons the company has
 declared net income for the past three years of more than $340 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parliamentary leader Guy 
Caron said: “Do you know how many taxes were paid? $1.1 million in three
 years. Can the Prime Minister explain why it would be in the national 
interest to give a blank check — for how much? $5 billion? $1 billion? —
 to a company like <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> that finds a way, and has an interest in not paying its fair share of taxes?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP made the charge in the Commons Monday where its MPs statements are protected from the application of libel laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau offered no direct
 answer about the company's tax obligations to Canada but defended his 
government's approach, and chastised the NDP for trying to block it “at 
any price.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is in the national interest to go ahead with it and that's why the pipeline will be built,” said Trudeau.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One
 of the burdens of being prime minister is that it affords the occupant 
of the office scant room to hide. Not that Justin Trudeau isn't trying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prime minister 
returned from his trip to New York and Boston with sweet Fanny Adams on 
borders or trade, i.e. the two major irritants in Canada's relationship 
with The Massive Irritant fronting the Gazebo of CrazyT formerly known 
as the presidency.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that you'd know Canada was much bothered - on either front - by the current state of affairs. Even with an important <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>
 deadline slipping by and the unofficial border-crossing season about to
 open, the official trip summary issued by Trudeau's office peddled only
 soft euphemisms about the Canada-U.S. "partnership" and its importance 
to "good, middle-class jobs," while (insert favoured euphemism for 
"illegal" here) border crossings weren't mentioned at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, we were reminded of the prime minister's cloying address to <span class="companylink">NYU</span>
 graduates, where Trudeau - from the comfort of his bubble - told an 
audience of admirers to get out of theirs, and a laundry list of 
meetings with business leaders whose welcomed investments in Canada will
 do little to mask the trauma should Trump decide to spite Canada and 
spike <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while Trudeau did 
talk trade with an audience of the converted at the Economic Club of New
 York, he wasn't playing offence and didn't offer a tactical 
intervention; his comments were mostly to cheer on the people who were 
doing the real work in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've worked with (the 
Americans) on a whole bunch of issues, including this morning in 
Washington where we have some of our top folks continuing the 
conversations," Trudeau told the audience. "I'm feeling positive about 
this, but it won't be done until it's done and people are working very, 
very hard on it right now," he added. To pick up on a theme the Liberals
 are currently pushing: It wasn't an answer Stephen Harper would have 
given.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And when Trudeau did 
eventually careen into specifics by saying Mexico had made proposals 
that will "go a long way towards reducing the trade deficit the U.S. has
 with Mexico and indeed even bringing back some auto jobs from Mexico to
 the United States," he was quickly rebuked on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>
 by Mexico's economy minister, who replied: "a clarification is 
necessary: any renegotiated Nafta that implies losses of existing 
Mexican jobs is unacceptable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fine, Trudeau isn't the 
details guy. But when partisans are trying to paint a picture of Trudeau
 as a man with "the political depth of a finger bowl," it would surely 
help the prime minister to take a deep dive on some of the complicated 
issues currently facing his government, whether it be <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>, illegal border crossings or the Trans Mountain pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, on all of these files Trudeau is taking a back seat to his ministers, with Chrystia Freeland fronting efforts to get <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>
 over the line, Bill Morneau playing pipeline poker and Ahmed Hussen 
trying to stem the flow of Nigerians crossing the 49th parallel. Given 
that failure on any of these fronts would be injurious to Liberal 
reelection prospects, it's a high-risk approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The charitable 
interpretation is that Trudeau trusts his team to get the job done. The 
PMO will also claim that each office is working in tandem with the 
Centre. But the longer Trudeau stays in the shadows as issues come to a 
boil, the more people might draw another conclusion: that the prime 
minister just doesn't have anything of substance to offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's also the question
 of brand. Even if stopping the flow over the Canada-U.S. border could 
be done without a willing partner in the U.S. (a ha-yuuge 'if'), doing 
so would run counter to Trudeau's public promise to welcome all. Trudeau
 can't be hard-ass on immigration for the same reason Stephen Harper 
couldn't be a candy-ass on the same question: the base would revolt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But last year saw upwards
 of 20,000 dodgy crossings, with experts predicting more this summer as 
the Trump administration continues to crack down on various communities 
who have overstayed their welcome. What Trudeau will eventually find out
 is what Harper knew to his core: that Canada's vaunted support for 
immigration is heavily predicated on its being done properly and fairly,
 which all can agree isn't an accurate description of what's currently 
happening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau is in a similar bind on pipelines, with his enviro-<b>social licence</b>-Indigenous-consultation image crashing hard into the economic necessity of our <b>oil</b> reaching tidewater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This leaves <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>
 as the one bona-fide opportunity for Trudeau to demonstrate some 
mettle. So, enough of the cheerleading prime minister, it's time to come
 out from behind your ministry and own a file. Andrew MacDougall is a 
Londonbased communications consultant and ex-director of communications

 Rachel Notley now says the reason she wants the Trans Mountain pipeline
 is so she can give us pharmacare - tax-funded coverage for prescription
 drugs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley wanted reporters 
to know Tuesday why she had chosen not to attend the western 
premiers'conference in Yellowknife this week. She said she was staying 
close to her office at the legislature so she could work on keeping 
Trans Mountain alive.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pipeline
 builders Kinder Morgan have said if there is no deal on the line by 
next week, they will abandon the project. (That would make Trans 
Mountain the third pipeline abandoned by energy companies since the 
provincial NDP and federal Liberals came to office in 2015.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we want to have pharmacare, Notley told reporters, we need the pipeline and the tax revenues it will generate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we want to make sure that every Canadian can get the medications they need, we need to be able to pay for it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">lgunter@postmedia.com 
Really!? Seriously!? Notley's push for Trans Mountain since last 
November has really just been about expanding the welfare state? We need
 the pipeline so we can make government even bigger? It used to be "<b>social licence</b>"
 - the theory that if Alberta made itself an environmental leader with 
high carbon taxes and stifling eco regulations, "green" politicians and 
eco-activists would welcome our pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Notley's sales pitch is "give us the pipeline so we can expand the social safety net."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new approach will be no more successful than the last one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Greens" are detached 
from reality. They believe a magical transformation of our economy from 
fossil fuels to no-carbon alternatives will occur as with the wave of a 
wand. Seamless, swift, unnoticed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They refuse to see the connections between jobs and pipelines, between prosperity and <b>oil</b>.
 They don't believe the energy sector is needed to help keep us all 
employed, so why would they worry that elaborate new social programs are
 impossible without Trans Mountain? In their world, the non-polluting 
fairy-dust economy will provide all the money we need to live happily 
ever after.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(I'm not even sure I want Trans Mountain if all the proceeds are to be used for is an expansion of the suffocating nanny state.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Isn't the Alberta 
government (and Ottawa for that matter) spending enough money already? 
Since they came to office just three years ago, the NDP have ramped up 
spending from $49 billion to $56 billion. That's nearly 15 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We don't have a revenue problem, Alberta has a spending problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pharmacare could cost around $2 billion a year for comprehensive coverage in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But isn't it a little 
premature for Notley to be tying Trans Mountain to free prescriptions 
when her government is racking up deficits at the rate of about $10 
billion a year? Shouldn't they dig themselves out of debt before they 
start thinking of even more, elaborate, expensive social programs? And 
consider this: in a study released Thursday, <span class="companylink">Vancouver's Fraser Institute</span>
 estimates that by 2021, the cost of the interest on the NDP's debt will
 be about $655 per Albertan, annually. (It was $176 per person in 2015.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of even the most
 expensive pharmacare plan would be about $470 per Albertan, meaning it 
is excess borrowing that is squeezing out pharmacare, not lack of tax 
revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the NDP were even 
remotely better money managers, they would be able to afford pharmacare 
with the revenues they have now. Then Trans Mountain revenues could be 
used to restore the Alberta Advantage - to reduce taxes and get out of 
the way of job-creating investment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's enough clatter 
going on in national and provincial politics to drown out even the 
loudest banter about the royal wedding. Our opposition party leaders in 
both the Ledge and on The Hill are holding government's feet to the fire
 over many thorny issues.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most
 of all it seems that our official oppositions are less than confident 
that the country's leadership and Alberta's most responsible are not 
acting in the best interest of the country and are showing a lack of 
intestinal fortitude dealing with the matter of pipelines. They're also 
challenging the government's carbon levy initiatives as being a burden 
on taxpayers and a disincentive to petro development. I tend to agree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've gone on and on about the folly of pursuing some sort of climate salvation at the expense of our <b>oil</b>,
 gas and coal industries. I still believe the economic benefits of a 
healthy carbon economy will foster the kind of innovations that will 
reduce emissions of real pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen 
oxides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The focus on CO 2 is 
misguided in my opinion, and the money spent in reducing that 
concentration could be far better spent mitigating real pollutants and 
preparing for inevitable climate fluctuations that will happen 
regardless of our efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it troubles me when 
even our right-wing politicians are still hung up on reducing greenhouse
 gas emissions all while criticizing the green lobby for crucifying all 
things carbon. Straddling that fence will only make you sore in places 
you really don't want to be sore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've also gone on at 
length about how I don't care much for U.S. President Donald Trump but 
he's really laid into the green movement, which I think was long past 
due.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Climate issues aside, 
there's a real feeling that our current governments have lost all 
connection with the working folks who pay the taxes that pay government 
salaries. There's a smug arrogance that seems to think that we regular 
folks don't know what we're talking about and that we just have to stand
 back and let the government run with the ball.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, while they're jetting around displaying their <b>social licence</b>, we're being considered a poisonous business regime by some pretty heavy hitters. Chief among them <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>, which just might take their ball and go home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And they just might sue the <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span> for lost opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No worries, says the 
government, there's a lineup of folks willing to step in. This is more 
than I know: Watch for some giant off-shore multi-nationals swooping in 
to plow in pipelines from Alberta in whatever direction they wish. Or 
worse yet, the government might end up owning pipelines. Even worse 
might be some big pension funds or heaven forbid Bombardier owns the 
infrastructure that determines how Alberta's resources get to market. 
All possible scenarios with some spooky strings attached. Although, if 
Bombardier owned the line, there would be no end of government money to 
operate it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm encouraged and 
hopeful the tide might be turning. It's been apparent government is on 
its heels when asked the hard questions. They read from scripted 
responses that often have little to do with the subject and they dare 
not depart from that script. There's a feeling that there's a real lack 
of competency, and the opposition is being tenacious in their efforts to
 reveal that lack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My political stance has 
generated the most critical mail I get. There are still some diehard 
souls who despise all things Conservative who fawn over Alberta's 
socialists and the junior Trudeau. That's the beauty of democracy; you 
can disagree even if you're wrong. Gotta go, I just waded in a little 
too deep.</p>

 we don't convince the world that we have our act together, as a 
country, on the environment, we will find it harder and harder to get 
our resources to world markets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was Justin Trudeau, 
during a 2013 speech in Calgary. Well, here in 2018, how together is 
"our" act on the environment? Currently B.C. and Alberta are staring out
 at each other over the ramparts on global warming. The Trans Mountain 
pipeline is the causus belli, but global warming, i.e., what is really 
meant by "the environment" these days, is what the strife in Canada is, 
and has been for quite a while, all about.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever
 it does for the Earth, global warming raises the temperature in 
politics. Take the ardent catastrophist Naomi Klein for instance. Her 
view of it is as the hell mouth to "injustice, racism, intolerance and 
wars," a tidy quartet. On Canada's much abjured <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 pipeline, Klein is only a little less fretful. She speaks of that, 
among other drear indictments, as having the potential to "cook the 
planet." A sense of proportion is clearly not a dominant virtue when 
global warming is your cause. Her views are the views of the movement. 
She is a leading antagonist in the global warming war.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that war the Canadian 
oilsands has been the main front for over a decade. It has been the 
object of the world's environmentalists'most sustained crusade. It will 
not take a Jeopardy sage to guess which national government has been 
most avidly the champion of the cause. The Trudeau government, with its 
acute ambition to be seen as the whitest of the white knights in the 
combat against the Great Warming to come, its patent yearning to be seen
 as a, or the, major player in the great cause, has made the fight 
against what it calls climate change its most public and urgent 
endeavour. Global warming has, for all intents, replaced peacekeeping as
 Canada's bid for global stature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In doing so, it has recklessly enriched the atmosphere in which the campaigns against Canadian <b>oil</b>
 are conducted, and equally - until very recent days - has been passive 
to the point of prostration to all the propaganda incessantly targeting 
Canadian jobs and Canadian industry in the oilfields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It effectively cancelled 
Energy East, banned future tanker traffic, cancelled Northern Gateway, 
hosted innumerable summits on fighting climate change, instituted a 
national carbon tax, strong-armed Alberta into an illusory deal for "<b>social licence</b>,"
 silently wrote off thousands and thousands of jobs in the process, and 
famously lamented not being able to close down the "carbon economy 
tomorrow." All to earn credits with the internationalist global warming 
consensus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those campaigns for the 
moment meet and are most intense in British Columbia. The one pipeline 
left on the Canadian drawing board now has for years been hectored and 
harassed, subject to protest and serpentine regulation, and dragged to 
near extinction. In fewer than two weeks we will hear whether <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>,
 which has spent one billion dollars merely to extend a pipeline built 
in 1953, has tired of the exercise and, exhausted, simply abandons the 
project out of bottomless frustration. They must really wonder why, with
 so little welcome, and up until their deadline, they faced a federal 
government so committed to a cause whose triumph would be the negation 
of all energy industries, anywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back to getting our act 
together. The federal government is also on the ramparts facing the B.C.
 government, with Finance Minister Bill Morneau levelling a caustic 
fusillade this week at B.C. Premier John Horgan and his green cohorts 
for obstructing the national purpose and "unconstitutionally" seeking to
 override federal authority. The federal government is not quite as hot 
over Saskatchewan's demurral to play into its global warming policy of 
the carbon tax, but it has already singled out Saskatchewan for 
financial penalties, withholding federal funds from that province - a 
tactic it will not deploy, however, against the far more contentious 
B.C. This fuels a legitimate charge that the Trudeau Liberals play the 
game unfairly as between provinces, and thereby manufactures a fresh 
friction within our newly fractious federation. Meantime Quebec, never a
 spectator on this file, is on side with B.C., as it was active in 
killing the Energy East pipeline and therefore actively in contest with 
Alberta, and latently with the Atlantic region. Global warming is not a 
buttress of national unity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the rampage stirred 
up by greenism does not stop there. In Ontario, Kathleen Wynne, in every
 other sense a capable and intelligent leader, by adopting the global 
warming cause and making it an Ontario project, has utterly exhausted 
her popularity. The various results of the woeful "green" efforts - 
waste, artful subsidies to renewables, cancellation of gas plants, a 
forest of overpriced windmills, the dread carbon tax, and tumid 
electricity prices - have blistered her apparently irredeemably with the
 voters, and polls suggest has turned her party into political pariahs. 
The only person truly happy about Ontario's green policies has to be 
Doug Ford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within our Indigenous communities division is rife. Those which signed on to <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 plead to be heard and are either never mentioned in all the volatile 
press on the subject, or vastly overwhelmed by the Indigenous activists,
 who in most reporting on this subject earn the headlines and the lead 
story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Atlantic region 
Newfoundland is waking up to the consideration that its offshore 
industry will probably be the next target of the global warming zealots.
 The Maritimes are waking up, too, that they let pass the cancellation 
of Energy East with reckless unconcern. The economy of the region will 
pay for that indifference, and the current perfect cloud of 32 Liberal 
MPs will pay for it too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trudeau government 
vastly overestimates and overpraises the power of "our example to the 
world." This is quite natural. Every author is the ideal reviewer of his
 own book. But to earn even that dubious international status, look at 
the costs at home. Canada's carbon tax, and its high zeal for the cause,
 cannot, in any substantial way, change the equations of the world's 
atmosphere. We are incidental to the problem, if indeed it is a problem.
 Whatever Canada does, or does not do, will not accelerate the crisis or
 diminish it, in any way that is meaningful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its zeal to be seen as
 champion for a problem we have minimal capacity to cure, this 
government has roiled the Canadian political landscape, stirred a 
current of rage in Alberta, set provinces bitterly at odds with each 
other, shattered the governing party in Ontario, placed useless taxes on
 an already depressed industry, and chased billions of dollars of 
investment money out of the country. Most grievously, it has already 
indicated to the world that Canada is a very inhospitable place for any 
projects large in scale that in any way might wander under the eyes and 
objections of global warming zealots, the politicians who support them, 
and governments that are their willing partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world has indeed 
already taken notice that Canada doesn't have its "act together" and 
Canada has already learned that it is "getting harder and harder to get 
its resources to world markets." It is certainly true of the most 
cardinal resource of global commerce, our <b>oil</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What a mess playing boy scout on global warming has created in our quiet Dominion.</p>

 to recap: In the quest to ship Alberta crude to overseas markets, the 
federal Liberals are down to one pipeline, having killed off Northern 
Gateway and allowed Energy East to die.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That pipeline, the Trans 
Mountain expansion, is now itself in considerable doubt, in part owing 
to the Liberals' previous encouragement (previous, that is, to coming to
 power) of its most determined opponents: by their delegitimization of 
the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>, which approved it; by the prime minister's apparent endorsement of the extra-legal doctrine of "<b>social licence</b>;"
 and by his apparent endorsement of another position found nowhere in 
law: that First Nations have a right, not just to be consulted, but to 
approve or disapprove of projects on lands to which they claim title.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It
 gets worse. With just one pipeline left to build, and having done their
 best to ensure it won't be built, the Liberals - having since declared 
(since, that is, coming to power) that in fact it will be built - are 
now down to one company to build it. One, or maybe none.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company that was going to build it, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>,
 last month said it will not proceed without some assurance that it can 
proceed - that it will not be subject to such delays, owing to the 
obstructionist tactics of the NDP government of British Columbia, as to 
make the whole thing uneconomic. It must have such assurance, the 
company says, by May 31.</p>

 to guarantee Trans Mountain(

 )</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not clear the Liberals can offer <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 the kind of assurance it needs - not by May 31, at any rate. The B.C. 
government has since referred a series of questions to the province's 
Court of Appeal asking whether it has authority to block the shipment of
 bitumen through the province; even if it is ultimately rebuffed, that 
is not going to happen before May 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals, meanwhile, 
have promised legislation clarifying and affirming federal jurisdiction 
over interprovincial pipelines, so as to deprive the courts of any 
wiggle room for the usual Solomonic finding of shared jurisdiction 
("co-operative federalism" and all that). The legislation, however, has 
yet to be produced. With just four sitting days left in the month, it is
 equally unlikely to be passed in time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the best the Liberals can offer <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 is a series of promises of what will happen after May 31: we'll pass 
the legislation, we'll win in court, and we'll compensate you for any 
delays. The finance minister this week described this as 
"indemnification" - insurance, basically - against the costs of B.C.'s 
political gamesmanship. How much this might amount to he did not say, 
with good reason: he can't. It's a matter to be negotiated with <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is that there
 is an imbalance in the two sides' negotiating positions. 
Notwithstanding the billion dollars it has sunk into the project to 
date, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> can walk away from 
it at any time, and will if it feels the capital required to complete 
the project could be more profitably deployed elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whereas the Liberals 
cannot walk away: they've committed, publicly and unequivocally, to the 
proposition that "the pipeline will be built."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's all very well for the finance minister to note the government might not have to pay out on <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s
 "insurance" policy - why, they might even charge the company a premium 
for it - but he's hardly in a position to dictate terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So to give themselves 
some bargaining leverage, the Liberals have been talking up all the 
other private companies they have lined up to take over the project, 
should they fail to come to terms with <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>. Companies like ... er, um, ah......</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reality is that if <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 is unwilling to complete the project, even with a federal backstop, it 
is unlikely any other private company would prove more willing. Not only
 would it face all of the same obstacles <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 faces - in addition to the B.C. government' s opposition, there is a 
separate lawsuit by several First Nations, plus the mounting threat of 
physical force by protesters on site - but it could not be certain the <span class="companylink">NEB</span>'s approval of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s application would apply to it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So increasingly the focus
 of speculation is on other, "non-private" sources of capital. And here 
is where things start to get a little alarming. If overt nationalization
 is unlikely, that does not mean it could not happen by other means.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The finance minister was 
quoted telling Reuters this week of the many "very sophisticated 
Canadian pension funds and institutional investors" with the expertise 
to take on the project. Again, he offered no names for the record, but 
it is significant that the first place the reporter went for comment was
 the <span class="companylink">Canada Pension Plan Investment Board</span>, an agency of government with fiduciary responsibility for the pensions of millions of retirees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CPPIB is free to 
invest in any project around the world. Is this really the sort of thing
 it wants to get mixed up in, a hugely contentious project backed by one
 of its government sponsors and opposed by another?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another possibility being
 floated is the nascent federal Infrastructure Bank. You'll recall the 
point of the bank was to be at arm's-length from political interference,
 and thus able to raise funds from private investors on strictly 
commercial terms. Yet hardly has it begun operations and the first thing
 it's supposed to finance is a pipeline the government has staked its 
life on?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe it will never come to that. Maybe the Liberals will find a way to keep <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> on board. But they are running out of options and they are running out of time.</p>

Mr. Michael Binnion reports</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTERRE REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2018 RESULTS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questerre Energy Corp</span>. has released its financial and operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, president and chief executive officer of Questerre, 
commented: "Our production and cash flow growth this quarter was 
primarily driven by the increased investment in Kakwa. Production from 
the joint venture acreage almost doubled from the first quarter of 2017.
 With additional drilling scheduled for later this summer at Kakwa, we 
could see production dip in the next few quarters before a further 
increase by year-end."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: "Through a 
recent partnership with an experienced Montney operator, we plan to 
develop our immediately offsetting acreage. We are looking forward to 
the results from the first well given the strong condensate rates and 
low acid gas from our adjacent producing wells."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Highlights:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Average daily production over 2,000 barrels of <b>oil</b> equivalent per day for the quarter;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Adjusted funds flow from operations more than doubled to $4.7-million;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Questerre partners with experienced operator to develop Kakwa North acreage;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Questerre commissions integration study for Jordan <b>oil</b> shale project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commenting on Quebec, he 
noted: "We were encouraged by comments this May from the Minister of 
Environment noting that the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources 
will soon be tabling regulations for hydrocarbons. Once finalized, we 
will be meeting with the municipalities to secure the local 
acceptability we need. We are confident there is interest in our clean 
gas pilot and its environmental and economic benefits."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Updating developments on its project in Jordan, he further added: "During the quarter, we engaged <span class="companylink">Hatch Ltd</span>., a global engineering firm, to review the engineering and economics for our <b>oil</b>
 shale project in Jordan. The initial project will target production of 
approximately 50,000 barrels per day and will include the costs to 
upgrade the produced <b>oil</b> to diesel and gasoline. Once this study 
is completed, we plan to commission a more detailed pre-FEED [prefront 
end engineering design] study as we commence negotiations for a 
concession agreement."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result of the 
increased capital investment in Kakwa last year, the company reported 
higher production volumes over prior periods. Production averaged 2,013 
barrels of <b>oil</b> equivalent per day for the quarter compared with 
1,123 boe per day for the same period last year with Kakwa accounting 
for over three-quarters of production during both periods. Gross revenue
 more than doubled to $9.54-million with higher production volumes 
benefiting from higher <b>oil</b> prices in the period. The higher 
revenue contributed to adjusted funds flow from operations of 
$4.65-million for the period compared with $1.41-million last year. The 
company reported net income of $60,000 for the current quarter compared 
with a loss of $520,000 for the first quarter last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capital investment for 
the quarter focused almost exclusively on Kakwa and totalled 
$8.66-million (2017: $5.32-million). The company anticipates incremental
 investment at Kakwa in 2018 could be up to $21-million and include six 
(1.5 net) wells subject to the operator's final plans and continued 
results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The term adjusted funds flow from operations is a non-international financial reporting standard measure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questerre Energy</span> is leveraging its 
expertise gained through early exposure to shale and other 
non-conventional reservoirs. The company has base production and 
reserves in the tight <b>oil</b> Bakken/Torquay of southeast 
Saskatchewan. It is bringing on production from its lands in the heart 
of the high-liquids Montney shale fairway. It is a leader on <b>social licence</b> to operate issues for its Utica shale gas discovery in the St. Lawrence Lowlands in Quebec.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were initially 
concerned over the controversy over the pipeline and the potential for 
the reputational risk it was causing the company, which hurts 
shareholder value, and legal liability that could end up affecting 
shareholder value," said Patrick Doherty, the comptroller's corporate 
governance director for New York state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state's comptroller oversees its massive Common Retirement Fund, which holds more than $100 million in <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resolution follows a

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Wednesday's vote

because it's being backed by two even larger investors: the $457-billion

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Prime Minister is about to ask taxpayers to bail him out of a self-inflicted calamity - the inability to ship our <b>oil</b> to overseas markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau promised the $7.4
 billion Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion (TMX) would be built because 
it's the last opportunity to prevent our vast reserves from being 
permanently landlocked. Letting the project die would cause so much 
economic, constitutional and reputational damage that no amount of 
spinning could save his government from grievous political damage. B.C. 
Premier John Horgan declared he will do everything to kill the pipeline.
 Trudeau cannot tolerate a province thwarting the federal government on a
 critical matter within an exclusive federal jurisdiction. He has to 
defend the constitution and rule of law or the very viability of our 
confederation will be undermined.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover,
 Canada's credibility with foreign investors would be tarnished when 
capital is already heading south because of a dramatic reduction in U.S.
 corporate tax rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau's face-saving 
plan mirrors Ronald Reagan's observation: "If it moves, tax it. If it 
keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it." Due to
 B.C. hostility, federal inaction and regulatory overreach, TMX became 
too risky and expensive. Trudeau and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley 
exacerbated the problem when they naively proposed a grand bargain 
doomed to fail - impose a costly carbon tax in exchange for the <b>social licence</b>
 to construct Trans Mountain. Now the Feds, perhaps with the Province of
 Alberta, will write a whopping cheque or provide indemnification to <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> or another private investor, possibly accompanied by support for First Nations' investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most Canadians understand our <b>oil</b>
 must not be stranded. The opportunity cost of this project alone is 
estimated at $74 billion in revenue over 20 years. For a country with 
10% of global proven reserves not to export its fossil fuel would be 
unconscionable madness. However, Trudeau is caught in an exquisite 
dilemma of his own making. According to a Nanos poll, over two-thirds of
 Canadians support the project, yet two-thirds oppose the use of 
taxpayers dollars to fund it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Prime Minister is responsible for why TMX is the lastgasp opportunity to access tidewater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He rejected the $7.9 billion Northern Gateway pipeline after Enbridge received the go-ahead from the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board (NEB) </span>and the previous Conservative cabinet. Then <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> cancelled the $15.7 billion Energy East pipeline because the <span class="companylink">NEB</span>
 extravagantly expanded the scope of its review to include downstream 
emissions. Since the government didn't overrule its regulator, Trudeau 
cannot hide behind its project-killing policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, the new Impact 
Assessment Act politicized the review process and exacerbated 
uncertainty to such an extent that no private sector sponsor will ever 
propose a major pipeline again unless the legislation is fundamentally 
changed. Think about it. The government of a fabulously oilrich country 
has precluded overseas sales. Ironically, that would harm the 
environment since exporting Canadian crude could replace higher 
greenhouse gas emitting coal and lessen foreign imports arriving by 
tanker up the Saint Lawrence River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau won't punish 
British Columbians by withholding infrastructure funding or social 
transfers since that would damage his electoral prospects in 18 Liberal 
seats in the Lower Mainland. It would also send a provocative signal 
about federal power to Quebec with its 40 Liberal seats and whose 
moribund sovereigntists are always one perceived outrage away from 
resurgence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau will try to take 
credit for rescuing Trans Mountain. That is like a CEO whose blunders 
drove a company to the brink, but demands a bonus when shareholders are 
forced to inject funds to keep it afloat. The executive should be fired.
 Next year, voters will determine Trudeau's fate.</p>

 leader of Canada’s Conservative Party insists his party would meet the 
Paris climate accord targets, but would not speculate on how it would do
 so. While Andrew Scheer is committed to dumping the federal carbon tax,
 he was mum on how his unfinished climate plan could impact on the <b>oil</b> and gas industry, one of Canada’s major greenhouse gas emitters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I am committed to 
ensuring that Canada plays its role [in the Paris accord]; you’ll pardon
 me for not unveiling every aspect or try to tip my hand. We are doing a
 tremendous amount of work to come up with a comprehensive plan on the 
environment,” Scheer said after an appearance at a Calgary Chamber of 
Commerce luncheon on Friday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I
 think there is a lot that can be done through incentives and through 
investments in research and technology, and that's always better than 
imposing a new tax on Canadian families.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a question and answer 
session with Sandip Lalli, president and CEO of the Calgary Chamber, 
Scheer blamed the governing federal Liberals for delays in construction 
of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>’s $7.4-billion Trans 
Mountain pipeline expansion, but said little about how a Conservative 
government would get it built in a more expeditious fashion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was cool on the idea 
of putting taxpayers dollars into the project or calling in the military
 should opposition on the ground attempt to further delay the project. <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> has set a May 31 deadline for the uncertainty around the project to be resolved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I believe very firmly that the issue around <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 is set in the backdrop of several decisions that were taken that 
shattered the confidence in Canada's energy sector,” he said, pointing 
to the cancelations of the Northern Gateway and Energy East pipeline 
proposals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And we have to talk 
about the carbon tax, which is a huge competitive disadvantage. When you
 put all that together, and then we see a provincial government taking 
action, that’s the tipping point for a project proponent. We called on 
Justin Trudeau to have a meeting with Premier [John] Horgan and Premier 
[Rachel] Notley months ago [and] nothing happened. The prime minister 
has the entire department of Natural Resources, the Department of 
Justice, at his disposal to come up with a plan. We are only now 
starting to talk about legislation to entrench and defend the relevant 
sections of the Constitution. We could have been having those debates, 
those conversations, taking those steps, back in January, February, even
 before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What a terrible 
indictment of his handling of this file. I am very disappointed and I 
sense the frustration here in Calgary and here in Alberta. It’s an 
emotional response because it’s their friends and neighbours who have 
been affected by this,” Scheer said. “I think everyone can agree, 
regardless of their political stripes, that the federal government 
investing tax dollars&nbsp;in an energy project is not the optimal 
solution. It’s come to here because of&nbsp;[Trudeau's] failures.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prime minister needs to be working with <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 to provide the confidence and the assurances that “it is not about the 
money, it’s not about taxpayers dollars. It’s about a plan, it’s about a
 timeline that they can work with in getting that project built in that 
timeline. I believe that if that was the focus then the use of 
government funds wouldn't be necessary,” said Scheer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, he said the 
pipeline has become a symbol for a larger issue. “I believe it’s 
essential to take a step back and remember how we got to where we are, 
and why is Trans Mountain the focal point. And it starts with right 
before the election where you have Justin Trudeau undermining the 
credibility of our science-based independent regulatory bodies who have 
for decades approved pipelines based on data and facts, and where there 
were improvements needed, ordered companies to make those improvements, 
and it worked. Canadians had confidence in it, until Justin Trudeau 
politicized it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So now all eyes are on 
Trans Mountain, the hardest of the three to get built because&nbsp;it 
is&nbsp;going right through the heart of the very place where the 
protesters are more prevalent, who have also been emboldened by the 
prime minister saying that they must give permission through <b>social licence</b> before projects can go ahead.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has now devolved into a
 “bizarre situation where we have a private company wanting to use 
shareholders money to build a project that would create jobs and 
economic activity in Canada, and the Liberal response is, well we are 
going to have to subsidize you to get to do that…. It should never have 
come to this. Hopefully we won’t be in the opposition too long and we 
can start to actually use the power of the federal government to get 
these important projects built.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked if he would 
consider bringing in the Canadian military to expedite pipeline 
construction, Scheer said: “I don’t think we have to get to there quite 
honestly. I think that that is something that the left would love to 
conjure up images of. There is a lot of space between here and there…. 
And in many cases it’s actually not the protesters that are the problem,
 it’s the NDP government of British Columbia that is the problem right 
now, and the RCMP and municipal police forces have to enforce the law. 
People don't get to just decide which laws to follow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think it is up to the 
federal government to make sure that the law is followed,” Scheer noted.
 “We have to be a country of laws. We can’t have people who disagree 
with the decision — a duly passed law or a legitimate use of the power 
of the government — we can’t allow these people who disagree with that 
to break the law, they don't have the right to do that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questioned about how the 
provinces are handling the pipeline impasse, Scheer found no fault with 
the Alberta government, but laid blame almost entirely on the federal 
government. “I think Premier Notley is in a tough spot, and whoever was 
premier of Alberta would be in a very difficult position, having to deal
 with British Columbia, but I don't want to focus on what one province 
should or should not [be] doing because my issue is that Justin Trudeau 
has done literally nothing for over a year and he has shown a complete 
lack of leadership and has forced provinces to take matters into their 
own hands, and they shouldn't have to do that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Social licence</b></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scheer also said the meaning of <b>social licence</b>
 has to remain science-based. “It’s funny [how] we have to define this 
now because it has been a term that has kind of been invented by the 
left, but I think fundamentally we have systems in place where experts 
and those that know&nbsp;the issue intimately, because&nbsp;they have 
got the training and they have the scientific credentials, are delegated
 to make decisions for us based on their best observations. And this 
isn't just about the energy sector,” he said. “Whether it’s a planned 
road or an LRT or a subway line, we have to have a decision-making 
process that citizens can have confidence in and then live with the 
decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As long as you have a transparent process based on a non-political approach to these things, then that is where <b>social licence</b> rests.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supercluster initiative</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In regard to innovation, 
Lalli noted, “other countries have been successful around clustering” in
 reference to the federal government’s $1 billion supercluster 
initiative, and asked what a Conservative government would do to promote
 innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s easy for 
governments to spend money and have big announcements,” Scheer said. 
“What is not seen is the cost of spending that billion dollars. And all 
the little decisions that get made for an entire economy because the 
government has made those choices and perhaps not other choices, or 
because they had to collect those taxes and take them out of the economy
 in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And then you have the 
idea that governments somehow can predict where these things are going 
to happen. I think a big fallacy for many politicians, certainly those 
of the Liberals and the NDP, is that there is somehow this giant 
switchboard that manages the economy and we can pull levers and turn 
dials and push buttons and we can grow the economy by having people in 
Ottawa guess and predict and do things better, and I don't agree with 
that at all. I think that the organic nature in which the free market 
works is always, always better than planned economies or decisions being
 made in government offices.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Internal, external trade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scheer said a 
Conservative government would work to ensure free trade among Canadian 
provinces. The current state of internal trade barriers, on items like 
alcohol, which was recently upheld by the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>,
 doesn’t send a good signal when negotiating trade deals with other 
countries. “It weakens our moral position, but also it weakens our 
economic position.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>, Scheer challenged the Trump administration’s sector-by-sector approach. “We have a challenge with <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>
 and the Conservative party has certainly tried to do what we can to 
support the government’s efforts. We have been critical with them here 
at home&nbsp;when we think they have missed opportunities,” he said. 
“But we have spoken with a united front when we go to the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have a particular 
challenge with the Trump administration, and that is, the U.S. 
administration right now is looking at trade along the lines of a 
sector-by-sector surplus or deficit calculation, so instead of looking 
at a trading relationship as a whole and saying, on the whole, what’s 
our trade surplus or deficit, what’s the economic impact, they are 
really drilling down into steel and aluminum and agriculture and 
manufacturing and auto,” and in any one of those sectors, not accepting 
the U.S. having a trade deficit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That's not an 
appropriate way to evaluate a trading relationship because as you know, 
every country does some things well and some things better and relies 
and benefits from another country doing other things well. For example, 
Canada has a massive deficit when it comes to citrus fruit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And as well we want [the
 federal government] to focus on jobs,” he added. “They are bringing a 
lot of social issues to the negotiation table that really don’t speak to
 market access and the jobs that go with that. So we think they should 
stay focused on keeping trade barriers away and improving market access 
for Canadian goods and services.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Productivity</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked what his government
 would do to increase productivity and help small and medium sized 
business to scale up, Scheer pointed to reforms to education to better 
target students to jobs. “One of the things we can do … is link skills 
training with available jobs, and rather than the model that many 
governments use which is to have the bulk of their&nbsp;focus on skills 
training going to other levels of government and then on through, kind 
of following the student.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We could also have 
support that goes to where the job is. So rather than say to a student, 
here is funding and you pick what you would like, part of the solution 
could be saying, OK, here is a training partnership with a company that 
knows that right now or in three or five years, there are going to be 
these types of jobs available, and attract the people to those jobs so 
that students aren't getting qualified or training in areas where there 
aren't jobs available, or where they likely won’t be. In other words, 
allow the market to play more of a role in allocating resources for 
skills training,” he said.</p>

 easy to miss amid the understandable political uproar over Canadian 
pipelines (or perhaps more appropriately, our apparent inability to 
build them) was the <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span> Monthly Merchandise Trade Report in February that tracks Canada's international balance of trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report indicated 
Canada's trade deficit amounted to $2.7 billion, which widened from $1.9
 billion from the prior month, with imports advancing 1.9 per cent 
month-over-month, mostly due to higher purchases of energy products.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hidden
 within those summary numbers was the revelation that imports of energy 
products into Canada advanced by a material 15.4 per cent to $3.4 
billion, the highest level since November 2014, with the largest share 
of those imports originating from the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The importation of crude <b>oil</b>
 and bitumen advanced 15.4 per cent, with imported refined petroleum 
products up by 24.1 per cent, the latter due largely to increased 
imports of gasoline into B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's increased importation of <b>oil</b> and its products reflects a growing trend in the past two years since the <span class="companylink">U.S. Congress</span> ended a 40-year ban on <b>oil</b> exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accompanied by surging U.S. production, crude <b>oil</b>
 exports from the U.S. to Canada (seasonally adjusted), have risen from 
$6.4 billion from September 2015 to February 2016, to $8.4 billion from 
September 2017 to February of this year, or by about a third.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While these numbers 
fluctuate monthly, the point is that in February, while Canada exported 
$8.8 billion in energy, it also imported $3.38 billion from 
international sources, which, according to <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span>, represents a year-to-year increase of 12.3 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada produces far more <b>oil</b> than it can consume, and hence it is the world's fourth largest producer and third largest exporter of <b>oil</b>. In 2016, Canada was the largest foreign supplier of crude <b>oil</b> to the U.S., with 99 per cent of our <b>oil</b> exports directed there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada accounted for 41 per cent of total U.S. crude <b>oil</b> imports and 20 per cent of U.S. refinery crude <b>oil</b> intake. However, <span class="companylink">Natural Resources Canada</span> also indicated that in 2016, Canada imported crude <b>oil</b> and equivalents from many countries, including the United States (62 per cent), Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Nigeria and Norway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when Canadian 
attentions, both public and political, are riveted on our pernicious 
lack of pipeline access to international <b>oil</b> markets, we question why so little attention is being paid to Canada's increasing importation of petroleum products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It cost Canadians $3.4 
billion in February alone. To be clear, we are not arguing a trade 
surplus or deficit is an appropriate barometer of a country's health. 
However, we do suggest growing U.S. exports, due to deregulation, and 
our inability to build infrastructure to export our energy, is not 
beneficial to Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada could enhance its 
security of supply, reduce its trade deficit and produce fewer global 
greenhouse gas emissions if we used more of our Canadian crude <b>oil</b> production. A recent study by the <span class="companylink">Canadian Energy Research Institute</span>, using 2016 data, indicates that substituting Canadian <b>oil</b> wherever possible using space on existing pipelines, rail cars and ocean tankers, could reduce foreign <b>oil</b> imports into Eastern Canada by a whopping 47 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This would save 
refineries $210 million and reduce Canadian emissions of carbon dioxide 
by the equivalent of more than two million tonnes, or about 5.7 per cent
 annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute also found that eastern Canadian refineries process just over one million barrels of <b>oil</b>
 per day, of which only 39 per cent originates from Western Canada and 
five per cent originates from the eastern Canadian offshore; fully 56 
per cent is imported from the United States (amounting to 260,000 
barrels of imported <b>oil</b> per day).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly, lower regulatory
 and fiscal costs would benefit all Canadians through the more efficient
 utilization of Canadian resources. Hence, we urgently need better 
policies to resolve our pipeline infrastructure problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a precarious B.C. government opposes <b>oil</b>
 pipelines, the Trudeau government's avowed transition away from fossil 
fuels appears perversely to be directed solely at penalizing Canadian 
producers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is overregulating 
domestic producers with misdirected policies that allow foreign 
petroleum imports - unimpeded by Canadian environmental laws, so-called <b>social licence</b>,
 greenhouse gas reduction strategies and associated taxes - to flood 
into Canada to displace jobs and discourage investment. Ron Wallace has

 Star -- The Trans Mountain Expansion pipeline has dominated news in the
 past few weeks. The public is divided over whether we should build this
 pipeline and allow Alberta <b>oil</b> sands output to increase, or whether it presents too much risk to BC's rivers and coastal environments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many experts described 
the original project approval process as deeply flawed. The Liberals 
ignored their campaign promise of a new, improved process and instead 
sent a ministerial panel along the pipeline route in the summer of 2016.
 Many communities and First Nations governments criticized this process 
as inadequate as well. However the panel did write a report that ended 
with a list of six clear questions for the government to answer before 
making a decision.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think it would be useful to review those questions to see more clearly how we got into this quagmire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Can construction of a 
new Trans Mountain Pipeline be reconciled with Canada's climate change 
commitments? Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr often proclaims "This 
pipeline will be built", but I have never heard him say "We will meet 
our Paris targets." For many pipeline opponents this is the crux of the 
problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. In the absence of a 
comprehensive national energy strategy, how can policy-makers 
effectively assess projects such as the Trans Mountain Pipeline? Canada 
needs a national energy strategy that would answer broader questions 
such as: what role new pipelines would play in a world where world <b>oil</b> demand (according to the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span> itself) will begin declining in 2019; how we might refine our <b>oil</b> resources for our own use rather than exporting bitumen and importing foreign <b>oil</b> on the Atlantic coast; and how we can create good jobs in renewable energy as the world shifts to a low carbon future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. How might Cabinet 
square approval of the Trans Mountain Pipeline with its commitment to 
reconciliation with First Nations and to the UNDRIP principles of "free,
 prior, and informed consent?" This is perhaps the key question that the
 federal government failed to answer before it approved the Trans 
Mountain Expansion. There is strong opposition to the project from many 
First Nations, and a number of lawsuits are in the courts arguing that 
the approval process did not involve proper consultation. If this is 
found to be the case (as it was in the Northern Gateway pipeline 
decision) it could delay the project another year or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. Given the changed 
economic and political circumstances, the perceived flaws in the NEB 
process, and also the criticism of the Ministerial Panel's own review, 
how can Canada be confident in its assessment of the project's economic 
rewards and risks? According to Nanos Research only 2% of Canadians have
 strong confidence in Canada's energy regulation system, a fact that 
bears on the discontent seen on both sides of this debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. If approved, what 
route would best serve aquifer, municipal, aquatic and marine safety? 
Kinder Morgan has not yet asked the government for approval of the exact
 route for much of the pipeline; in many cases the old route will not be
 followed, especially in the Lower Mainland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6. How does federal policy define the terms "<b>social licence</b>"
 and "Canadian public interest" and their inter-relationships? Through 
the election campaign, Justin Trudeau repeated the mantra "governments 
can grant permits, but only communities grant permission". The federal 
government now finds itself in a very difficult situation, having to 
tell coastal British Columbians that the project is in the national 
interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is now too late to 
answer these questions before Kinder Morgan's self-imposed deadline of 
May 31, but we would have been in a much better situation had the 
government fully dealt with them before approving the Trans Mountain 
expansion project.</p>

 brought the pipeline conflict onto itself by not doing enough to earn 
public trust, according to a new Angus Reid Institute poll released 
Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute released 
further analysis on data it collected last week — immediately following 
Trudeau's meeting with B.C. and Alberta's premiers — that showed growing
 support for the pipeline nationwide. <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 has currently suspended all non-essential spending on the project and 
says it will decide whether to pull out completely by May 31.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week's poll showed most Canadians (58 per cent) think <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> could have done more to gain <b>social licence</b> before breaking ground. Even those who support the pipeline (56 per cent), share that opinion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has had years to engage Canadians, Shachi Kurl, executive director of Angus Reid Institute, pointed out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is newer to the national landscape but we [in B.C.] have been talking about this <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> expansions since 2012,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“British Columbians are certainly of the view that the company could have done a better job.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings also point to <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s
 lack of success in reaching residents, she said. Many of Canada's 
politicians are on-board with the project, but voters are not 
necessarily receiving the same message, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“How many people can name
 the CEO or a single leader at the company. How front and centre have 
they been in leading the conversation or the debate?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, protestors — 
both abroad, like this weekend's demonstration in London, and at home, 
like the protest camp on Burnaby Mountain — dominate news coverage. But 
poll results show that demonstrations make Canadians more likely to 
support the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Alberta, where 
opposition is staunchest, this phenomenon is especially evident: almost 
half (48 per cent) of Albertans say they are more likely to support the 
pipeline due to the protests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Protestors have the effect of preaching to the converted sometimes, Kurl explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They can excite their 
base. They can recommit people if they are mildly opposed and certainly,
 protests can raise awareness and result in the hardening of views,” she
 said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But they aren't necessarily a vehicle to change peoples' minds.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six in 10 Canadians report that the protestors don't represent mainstream views, according to the Angus Reid Institute report.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada
 is in the middle of a pipeline crisis because three of the four main 
actors in this drama need a pipeline but don't want one. Meanwhile, the 
fourth actor wants one but doesn't really need it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three politicians in 
this circus - Alberta NDP Premier Rachel Notley, Liberal Prime Minister 
Justin Trudeau and B.C. NDP Premier John Horgan - are all "greenies" and
 would rather <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s Trans Mountain expansion not be built for environmental reasons.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet for one reason or another, all three of them need Trans Mountain (even though Horgan won't admit his need publicly yet).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley and Trudeau want 
Trans Mountain the least. They have drunk the "green" Kool-Aid and truly
 think our atmosphere is going to hell in a pipeline. They are committed
 to the notion that Canada can (and should) end the use of fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only reason Notley and Trudeau are now defending Trans Mountain is that both need it for fiscal and political reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley clings to the hope
 that if she can get a pipeline well underway before next spring's 
provincial election, she will be able to convince enough Alberta voters 
to stop hating her government enough that her NDP can sneak a second 
term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She also knows there is 
no way Alberta's budget will ever be balanced again without the revenues
 associated with at least one pipeline. All the wind turbines and solar 
farms in the country can't replace the revenues from <b>oil</b> and gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, Notley bet the house on "<b>social licence</b>"
 - the theory that if Alberta self-inflicted enough economic pain in the
 name of the environment, other provinces and eco-protesters would 
welcome our pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, <b>social licence</b> hasn't worked because it was never going to work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, Notley was 
so confident in her airy-fairy theory that she gave Quebec a veto over 
Energy East: Don't like our climate plan? Don't take our pipeline! So, 
of course, because the Quebec government never wanted the pipeline for 
political reasons, they were only too happy to help kill Energy East by 
insisting the eco plan didn't go far enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So now, for political and budgetary reasons, Notley absolutely must produce a completed Trans Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Notley, Trudeau needs pipeline revenues to rebalance his government's budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And since Trudeau and his
 government created environmental rules that made it impossible for 
other pipelines to go ahead - such as Northern Gateway and Energy East -
 Trudeau's pipeline eggs are now all in <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s basket, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ironically, of the three,
 Horgan is perhaps the most pro-development (or maybe that should be the
 least anti-development). Still, he is forced to be the most vocal 
opponent because the British Columbians most likely to vote NDP are also
 those most against <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>. More
 importantly, his governing coalition is being held in power by three 
Green MLAs who would likely abandon him and force an election if he 
allowed Trans Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But consider this: The 
Horgan government needs resource revenues, too. And it knows B.C. voters
 like LNG (liquified natural gas). So when it is ready for another 
election, the B.C. NDP will likely approve LNG, triggering the Greens to
 bring the government down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that brings us to why Horgan could end up needing Trans Mountain as much as Notley and Trudeau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The feds could withhold federal approval of LNG until Horgan permits a pipeline to be built across B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And since Trans Mountain 
is the only pipeline still out there ... Kinder Morgan, of course, is 
the one player that truly wants Trans Mountain. But it has signalled it 
may no longer need it and will walk away. Which is why two of the actors
 who need the pipeline for political reasons are talking about buying 
Trans Mountain They'll use our tax dollars to enhance their political 
fortunes.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It
 was not inevitable that we should arrive at such a pass over the Trans 
Mountain pipeline expansion: province divided against province, First 
Nation against First Nation, with the economic union and the rule of law
 as potential collateral damage. A debacle this big does not come about 
without years of hard work on all sides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We should be clear on one thing: this is not a debate about a pipeline, or not any longer. It is about who decides.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reasonable
 people will differ on the merits of Trans Mountain. But whatever 
anyone's opinion, there is a lawful process for deciding these things, 
and lawful authority to decide them. In the present case, those lawful 
authorities are the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>, the federal cabinet, and the courts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever anyone's 
concerns - economic, environmental, Indigenous or other - that is the 
process by which those concerns are adjudicated. And that is the process
 that approved the pipeline: the <span class="companylink">NEB</span>, 
the cabinet and the courts, all ruling in its favour (though not every 
legal appeal has been exhausted: a case is still before the Federal 
Court of Appeal on behalf of seven First Nations arguing they were not 
adequately consulted). Why, then, do so many feel entitled, not merely 
to disagree, or to protest, as is their democratic right, but to 
substitute their own authority for that prescribed by law: to defy the 
courts, to threaten disorder, and to deny federal jurisdiction? Much of 
the blame should be attached to the custodians of lawful authority, the 
governments of Canada and British Columbia. It was Justin Trudeau who, 
campaigning for office, gave his imprimatur to the extralegal, 
anti-democratic doctrine of "<b>social licence</b>," telling pipeline opponents that "governments might grant permits, but only communities can grant permission."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was Trudeau, too, who 
lent support to the notion that Indigenous communities have, not merely a
 constitutional right to be consulted on projects affecting lands to 
which they have title, as the courts have found they have, but an 
absolute veto. And it was Trudeau who legitimized those who, because 
they did not like the <span class="companylink">NEB</span>'s decision, had dismissed it as biased or negligent, with his promise of a special panel to review the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, it was John 
Horgan who, campaigning for office, famously promised to "use every tool
 in the toolbox" to stop the pipeline from being built. We know now that
 his government has known since at least the time it took office that it
 had no constitutional authority to do so. But if Horgan had hoped to 
walk back the promise, in the grand tradition of Canadian politics, 
after he was elected, he finds his way blocked by his partners in power,
 the Green Party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So he has instead opted 
to stall for time, delaying permits, threatening legislation, and - 
someday, maybe - referring the whole business to the courts, hoping the 
project's sponsor, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>, will 
give up in frustration. As, at length, it has declared it will do if 
Horgan's government is not brought to heel, with spectacular effect: it 
has spurred the Trudeau government to state, in terms that allow no 
retreat, that "the pipeline will be built."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But reasserting lawful 
authority, after so many years of disuse, will not be as easy as all 
that. It is not only the Trudeau or Horgan governments, after all, that 
have played this game: before Horgan, there was Christy Clark and her 
constitutionally odious "five conditions" for "approving" the Northern 
Gateway pipeline, and before Trudeau there were decades of federal 
governments that allowed the provinces to run the jurisdictional table 
against them, in the name of "co-operative federalism."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trans Mountain marks the 
final terminus of that process: as it is not possible for the feds to 
cave, so they are forced to act, in spite of themselves. That holds 
great peril - not for nothing did the government of Quebec, sensing a 
precedent, warn the feds not to intervene - but also great promise. But 
it will require great dexterity: a mixture of firmness and delicacy. 
Ottawa cannot simply snap its fingers and force the pipeline through - 
not at acceptable political cost, at any rate. But it can prevail, if it
 is patient and wise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this regard, the mix of measures emerging as federal strategy, belated as they are, show much promise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first: legislation 
explicitly asserting and defining federal authority over the pipeline, 
in some detail. That doesn't abolish B.C.'s recourse to the courts - 
nothing can - but leaves less room for it to exploit any ambiguities 
about federal intentions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second: some form of financial backstop to <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>,
 to assure it that its investment in a lawfully approved project will 
not be devalued, in whole or in part, by B.C.'s dilatory tactics. I have
 seen this denounced as a subsidy or bailout. The details will matter (a
 loan or equity stake would be inferior to a simple promissory note) but
 in principle it seems rather in the nature of compensation for 
expropriation - though it would be appropriate for the feds to recoup 
any payout from B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the third: some sort 
of face-saving sop to the B.C. government - more spending on protective 
measures in the event of a spill, for example. It may seem galling to 
reward it for its intransigence, but it is also probably necessary to 
smooth the path of eventual acquiescence, and gives it something to wave
 at the Greens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, yes. There is a 
fourth, unstated, part: legislation, now before the Alberta legislature,
 empowering the province to throttle supplies of conventional <b>oil</b>
 to B.C. The feds, to be sure, would have no part in such a flagrantly 
unconstitutional exercise, nor should they. But every good cop needs a 
bad cop.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When
 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hosted a confab in Ottawa on Sunday 
between our NDP Premier Rachel Notley and B.C.'s NDP Premier John 
Horgan, the only concrete result was an Ottawa-Alberta alliance to throw
 taxpayer money at a project that wouldn't need subsidies if these three
 governments'environmentalism hadn't scared away all private investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, sure, after the 
meeting Trudeau also promised to introduce legislation soon that would 
"reassert and reinforce" Ottawa's constitutional authority to ensure the
 Trans Mountain expansion project gets built. Whoop-de-do. This is about
 as necessary as the feds passing a law reaffirming their constitutional
 authority over the issuing of coins and currency, the post office, the 
census and "beacons, buoys, lighthouses and Sable Island."</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 key development from Sunday's pipeline summit was the willingness of 
the Trudeau and Notley governments to put our money where their mouths 
are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Notley 
government, this reminds me of their mess-up over their Climate 
Leadership Plan and PPAs (power purchase agreements).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When our NDP brought in their Climate Leadership Plan in 2015, they failed to consider the effect on PPAs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large-scale buyers of 
power had long-term contracts with the provincial electricity balancing 
pool that permitted them to cancel those contracts if the government 
took action that made the contracts unprofitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley's climate plan 
imposed huge new taxes on large-scale emitters. That made the PPAs 
unprofitable, resulting in the cancellation of many. That NDP failure 
cost Alberta taxpayers at least $2 billion, and likely more than $3 
billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now we can see the failure of the Notley NDP's "<b>social licence</b>" experiment to get pipelines built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta NDP have beggared our economy and overburdened our <b>oil</b>
 and gas industry with regulations and taxes, all in the name of 
convincing "green" activists to stop blocking our pipelines. Instead, 
the NDP's drumbeat on climate change, sustainable development and 
alternate energies has merely emboldened activists to hold out longer 
against new pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sunday, we saw clearly
 where this latest NDP failure has led us - to a joint deal with Trudeau
 and his government to pump perhaps billions of tax dollars into saving <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But remember this key 
fact: the Trans Mountain expansion project is economically viable. 
Pipelines are being built elsewhere around the world even at current <b>oil</b> prices. Trans Mountain doesn't need subsidies to make it profitable. It needs subsidies only because of political failures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However much of our money Trudeau and Notley throw at <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> is being thrown at the project only because both the feds and the province failed politically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their carbon taxes and 
added environmental regulations, their pandering to eco-activists and 
Indigenous politicians hasn't worked. So now we taxpayers are going to 
have to fork over billions to save the Liberals'and New 
Democrats'political skins, as well as to save a pipeline project that 
didn't need help in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the sequel to the NDP and the PPAs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta NDP cling to 
the fainter-than-faint hope that if they can keep Trans Mountain going, 
they might sneak a second term next year. So they are prepared to raid 
the Heritage Fund or run an even larger deficit to hand a couple billion
 dollars they don't have over to <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the federal 
Liberals are worried for the first time that they might not win 
re-election next year. They don't care about winning votes in Alberta, 
but they realize they have to show concrete action on Trans Mountain or 
risk alienating Ontario voters, who actually care about a prosperous 
economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Make no mistake, though, all this is is a subsidy from taxpayers to the shareholders of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> just to save the NDP's and Liberals'political hides.</p>

 announced last Sunday it is suspending the Alberta-B.C. Trans Mountain 
pipeline expansion project and setting a May 31 deadline for reassurance
 that its construction can proceed as approved in the face of opposition
 in B.C., where the minority government is vowing to halt it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta is apoplectic and threatens to throttle <b>oil</b> and gas supplies to B.C. residents, promising punitive legislation as early as next week in retaliation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The showdown poses a 
crucial test of Trudeau's national leadership: whether he can fulfil his
 promise to expand economic growth while balancing the concerns of 
Indigenous and environmental opponents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So forget "<b>social licence</b>." Trudeau's got his sparring gloves on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The PM, who once campaigned on a more collaborative approach to federalism, says "the pipeline will get built."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has called on B.C. to stop "obstructing" it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau says he has a 
"broad range of options" - legal, regulatory and financial - to assert 
federal jurisdiction over an interprovincial pipeline expansion that was
 already approved by the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span> and the federal cabinet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So just what is on the table?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government won't 
discuss any "options" under consideration, especially financial aid, 
given concerns about having an impact on the publicly traded <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>. But sources say a plan will be ready before the next cabinet meeting on April 24.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some of the 
choices that a range of experts inside and outside government, most of 
whom agreed to speak only for background, suggested:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Legal and regulatory</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government could 
enact a new bill - call it, say, the Trans-Mountain Act - to clearly 
define and assert federal jurisdiction on the project and hobble the 
B.C. NDP's planned reference to a B.C. court on the question of its 
jurisdiction. The federal government could take over permitting and 
other regulatory approvals for the project. It could clarify its own 
powers and add other burdens or outline penalties for the province if it
 tries to stand in the way of the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa could withhold 
discretionary funds from B.C. such as spending on regional economic 
diversification, innovation or other monies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government 
could, counterintuitively, require further environmental controls on the
 project, say double-walled pipelines or increased marine protections to
 further address Indigenous and environmental concerns - beyond the 
$1.5-billion oceans protection plan it already promised to address the 
previous B.C. Liberal government's concerns - in exchange for some kind 
of guarantee the B.C. government would cease its opposition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In theory, Ottawa could 
disallow a B.C. law or regulation that it declares as contrary to the 
national interest, but that kind of sledgehammer hasn't been used since 
the 1940s, and legal experts say convention suggests it should not be 
used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa could, however, 
invoke federal emergency powers to deal with protests if they were to 
block construction. However the RCMP already has lawful powers to 
enforce a B.C. court-ordered injunction against protests within five 
metres of two work sites, and last month arrested dozens of protesters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal sources dismiss 
talk of calling in the military. "None of this uncertainty is about 
protests," said one official. Rather, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s
 uncertainty centres on B.C.'s vow to put legal hurdles in the way of 
the project. "It's making investors skittish," the official said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finance Minister Bill 
Morneau said the government is looking to "de-risk the project so that 
it goes forward." In plain language, that means underwrite or assume 
some of the project's risk in some way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Tim McMillan, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum 
Producers, said "there are a 1,000 permutations" of what financial 
backstop could look like. Others inside government agree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government 
and/or the Alberta government could buy a partial or even a controlling 
stake (a highly unlikely, but not off-the-table option) in a project 
that is 30 per cent held by <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada Limited</span> and 70 per cent owned by Texas-based <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan, Inc</span>., one of North America's largest pipeline operators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upside: it would 
assure investors Canada is prepared to put its money where its mouth is 
to push the project through. The downside: the prospect of Justin 
Trudeau buying into an oilsands pipeline company would surely run 
counter to his stance on climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa could provide some
 kind of financial guarantee to backstop or insure any part of the 
project, such as construction costs, on a look-back or a go-forward 
basis - a kind of insurance policy for the $1.1-billion <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 has already spent or against future spending on a project estimated to 
cost $7.4 billion. Right now, because the project is not 
full-steam-ahead, construction costs are estimated at about $20 million a
 month, but if the green light is given to start large-scale 
construction, that is expected to run as high as $200 million to $300 
million a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa's options could 
include a loan guarantee. It could loan money and collect interest or 
forgo interest in exchange for equity knowing the return on the 
investment is secure. <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> has secured commitments from 13 of Western Canada's largest <b>oil</b> producers that they will ship heavy and light crude through the pipeline once its capacity is tripled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> won't say publicly what 
action it wants Ottawa to take, or whether it even wants the government 
to take an equity stake. The company won't comment on Sunday's summit in
 Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement to the Star, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 said it will continue to consult "with various stakeholders" to see if 
an agreement can be reached by June. "The focus in those consultations 
will be on two principles: clarity on the path forward, particularly 
with respect to the ability to construct through B.C.; and, adequate 
protection of KML shareholders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be clear, Ottawa has already narrowed the range of "options" it is prepared to take.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morneau dismissed outright B.C.'s request that Ottawa ask the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>
 to decide whether the province has any environmental or marine 
protection jurisdiction that would allow it to put new controls on <b>oil</b> flows in the proposed expansion of the Alberta-B. C. pipeline, in the name of defending B.C.'s coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't see a need to refer something to the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>
 when we already know that it's a federal jurisdiction," said the 
finance minister. "That from our standpoint is not a course of action 
that makes sense."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span> reference wouldn't solve anything by May 31 in any case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And for Justin Trudeau to
 claim success, let alone carry the banner of being a different kind of 
national leader - different than the polarizing figure that his father 
was - the answer would seem to lie in a political agreement to resolve 
differences, in the spirit of co-operative federalism, not in a 
judicially imposed resolution.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the nation mourning Humboldt's loss, pecking out an obstinate tweet about an <b>oil</b>
 pipeline buried in political grief wasn't at the top of Justin 
Trudeau's to-do list. Yet the prime minister tweeted it out before 
joining members of the shattered prairie community for last Sunday's 
vigil.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome
 to government, where events never pause and most days are an endless 
series of bad and worse choices. Trudeau is certainly down to bad and 
worse on the question of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s crown jewel, which happens to double as his fig-leaf on <b>oil</b> and gas policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau the green 
carbontaxer might really, really (really) want this singular pipeline 
built, but if the company building it is now wavering, and the Green 
party dependent NDP premier of the province through which it must pass 
hasn't yet found a body he won't chuck in front of it, at what point do 
you call a spade no spade and concede the Earth will not be moving? 
Perhaps fearing for its economic and constitutional credibility, the 
answer from Team Trudeau is a ringing "not now, not ever."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are determined to see
 (Trans Mountain) built," Trudeau has told reporters. "It is in the 
national interest. It doesn't make any sense for us to continue to have a
 $15-billion discount on our <b>oil</b> resources because we are trapped
 with an American market. We need to get our resources to new markets." 
Indeed. The same words could have - and did - come out of Stephen 
Harper's mouth. Trudeau now has to bell the cat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't meant to be this way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harper's confrontational 
"cramthem-down-your-throats" pipeline policy was to be replaced with 
Trudeau's more charismatic approach that would accrue the "<b>social licence</b>"
 needed to grease construction, a canard that happens to be, despite the
 environmental hysteria, the only fauna killed to date along the 
pipeline's route.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To frame the debate as proeconomy versus pro-environment is to miss the point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Trans Mountain 
ultimately proves is the past 20 years of debate in Canada has split 
people into two irreconcilable camps: pro-<b>oil</b> and anti-<b>oil</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preening at climate summits and taxing carbon won't make exporting <b>oil</b>
 kosher to those who are resolutely opposed. Over their dead bodies is 
the message being passed to Trudeau at the minute. It's not a question 
of law, it's a matter of will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Giddy though the 
opposition parties might be, now is not the time for them to revel in 
Trudeau's mire. Seeing your opponent hoist with his own petard is 
satisfying, but if the pipeline really is in Canada's national interest -
 and it is - the opposition should offer some constructive suggestions 
along with any withering scorn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the rather shouty and petty state of modern politics, this won't happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The partisan urge to 
nannynanny-boo-boo is too strong and besides, Conservatives will say, 
the Liberals didn't exactly lift a finger of support in opposition 
before assuming office and turning the matter into a constitutional 
crisis. Further disincentivizing bipartisan efforts is the Trudeau 
carbon tax, a big part of the government's <b>social licence</b> play that is not particularly well-read by any capital-C Conservative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here, Trudeau shoulders a
 good chunk of the blame. For all his talk of kumbaya, Trudeau's Pan 
Canadian Framework for Clean Energy and Climate Change - with its plan 
for carbon "pricing" - was effectively crammed down provincial throats. 
And with Rachel Notley and Kathleen Wynne's governments now in severe 
financial distress, voters there and across Canada will surely begin to 
wonder why the hell they're on the road to higher taxes if those uppity 
British Columbians aren't holding up their end of the <b>social-licence</b> bargain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is where federal NDP
 leader Jagmeet Singh should have a useful intervention to make, given 
it's his provincial brethren on opposite sides of the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 dispute. But to hope for substance from Singh is to wish for unicorns. 
Singh has done the easy thing and sided with B.C. and its brighter 
federal electoral prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where does this leave Trans Mountain? Shorn of friends and solutions, but all is not yet lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government can, and should, re-assert its constitutional right to build the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yes, the feds can join Alberta in slapping down money and insurance guarantees. But that's only half the battle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the communities along 
the pipeline route remain ready to obstruct its construction it's going 
to take a lot more than bucks and words to clear the way. Even the stern
 words of a judge urging protesters out of the way might not do the 
trick. What then? Do the sunny ways of Trudeau the son even allow for a 
hint of the army steel flashed by his father? Do we just ... watch him?

 investors spooked by the uncertainty plaguing the planned Trans 
Mountain pipeline expansion, Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr said 
Friday as a high-level, make-or-break meeting loomed on the horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government is still 
examining its options, Carr said, but won't commit to a course of action
 before Sunday, when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau jets home from Peru 
for a hastily organized meeting in Ottawa with British Columbia Premier 
John Horgan and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What
 we're now faced with is to find ways to make sure there is more 
certainty than there is now," Carr said in an interview with the <span class="companylink">Canadian Press</span>.
 "One of the ways to make sure there is more certainty is to look at 
possible financial arrangements that would help de-risk the project."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pipeline builder Kinder 
Morgan has halted all non-essential spending on the project until it 
gets assurances from Ottawa that the issues will be resolved. The 
federal government has until May 31 to respond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau has put a lot of 
political eggs in the Trans Mountain basket, risking political capital 
among climate-change activists in search of middle ground that allows 
for pipeline construction alongside improved <span class="companylink">environmental safeguards</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau, who is currently
 in Peru for the Summit of the Americas, was originally supposed to fly 
to Paris directly from Lima on Sunday for meetings with French President
 Emmanuel Macron. Instead, he'll be back in the national capital in 
search of a resolution to an intractable - and politically perilous - 
dispute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carr refused to discuss 
the specific financial options available, other than to say there are 
many of them on the table and they're all being considered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of those options, 
however, is to buy a stake in the pipeline, something Notley has already
 said Alberta would be willing to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada and Alberta could jointly buy the pipeline outright, or at least a significant stake in the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another option is to 
provide a guaranteed source of revenue for private investors if the 
pipeline completion date misses the target for when returns on their 
investments were supposed to start flowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company had targeted 
May 31 as the make-or-break deadline to start construction if the 
pipeline was to hit those investment targets. That date is now the 
drop-dead date <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> has given Canada to prove the company should have the confidence to move forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Political strategist 
Robin Sears, a principal at Earnscliffe Strategy Group, said another 
option would be to increase spending on the environmental protection 
side, including on improved research into preventing and mitigating the 
impacts of a diluted bitumen spill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The company has not done
 what it needs to have done to satisfy the people of B.C. they have 
taken the steps necessary to protect the environment," said <span class="companylink">Sears</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sears said the Trudeau 
government has an oceans-protection plan on paper, but hasn't done much 
if anything to put it into action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carr was only prepared to
 say Sunday's meeting between Trudeau and the premiers would be a chance
 for the various sides to share their positions and try to talk things 
out - not necessarily a day when further action would be announced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, said <span class="companylink">Sears</span>, would be a bad political move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If they come out of that
 meeting on Sunday and [Trudeau] says, 'We've made good progress and I'm
 off to Paris,'it will cost them severely," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">University of British 
Columbia politics professor Kathryn Harrison said she doesn't know that 
there is a way for everyone to come out of Sunday's meeting with a win. 
"They have drawn lines in the sand that are simply incompatible," said 
Harrison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau and Carr have 
spent more than two years accusing the former Conservative government of
 themselves failing to build pipelines because they stacked the deck 
against environmental concerns, failing in the process to get the <b>social licence</b> necessary to allow the projects to proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals introduced 
new review processes that accounted for things like the potential 
greenhouse gas emissions resulting from increased <b>oil</b> flows. The <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>'s 2016 approval of Trans Mountain required monitoring and upstream emissions offsets related to construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But environmental 
concerns remain - including the risk of higher emissions from increased 
oilsands production and the environmental impact of a spill. As a 
result, environmentalists who helped get Trudeau elected are now 
doubting his commitment to the cause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harrison said Trudeau has
 staked a claim on being able to reconcile both interests, offering up 
the pipeline - and the resulting ability to get resources to market - as
 a quid pro quo to get provincial and stakeholder support for a carbon 
price and environmental investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That was the compromise 
and they got pretty far with it," Harrison said, noting all provinces 
but Saskatchewan signed onto the climate-change framework.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're at that point now 
where the trains are colliding. This is a moment of truth for Canada and
 a country that relies heavily on producing fossil fuels."</p>

 ) that offended people on the right. Their promised aim of reducing 
emissions has ended up coming up short because the carbon levies, where 
they were applied, were not enough to materially change consumption when
 crude <b>oil</b> prices were falling, disillusioning people on the 
left. Carbon taxes also failed on the claim they would bridge the gap 
between the environment and the economy by creating the <b>social licence</b>
 to build a pipeline. In Canada, the final nail in their coffin was the 
election of a U.S. administration uninterested in an American carbon tax
 (or any costly climate measures) automatically putting Canadian 
industries at a competitive disadvantage with higher energy costs but no
 prospect of lower global emissions, making the whole exercise both 
costly and pointless.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Academic initiatives such
 as the EcoFiscal Commission and the like-minded Sustainable Prosperity 
Institute operate in an echo chamber where the converted preach to the 
converted rather than connecting with the general population. 
Presumably, the hope was that if enough academics and government 
officials signed on to a carbon tax the public would somehow internalize
 it via osmosis. Instead, opponents to a carbon tax are poised to soon 
take power in Alberta, Ontario and, based on the latest polling, 
possibly federally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal Liberal and 
the Alberta NDP governments plainly deserve the blame for failing to 
deliver on their promise that a carbon tax would buy <b>social licence</b>
 for pipeline construction, with the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain 
expansion just the latest casualty (after the cancellation of Energy 
East and Northern Gateway). They naively argued the environmental fringe
 could be reasoned with, ignoring that professional eco-warriors are 
possessed by what conservative sociologist Peter Berger called "mob 
psychology, the mystique of the street, the rage against all 
institutions of liberal democracy, and, last but not least, the militant
 anti-reason impervious to argument." Say what you want about U.S. 
President Donald Trump, but he quickly and peacefully ended the raucous 
protests against the North Dakota Access pipeline by showing he was 
implacably committed to building it, thus dissuading opponents from 
thinking their protests would produce the sort of dithering response 
they knew to expect from the governments of Justin Trudeau and Barack 
Obama. Four months after Trump took office, <b>oil</b> was flowing 
through the North Dakota pipeline, a visible demonstration to 
international investors of the difference in leadership between Canada 
and the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campaign for the 
carbon tax bears a close resemblance to that for the GST. While 
value-added sales taxes like the GST are universally beloved by 
economists and bureaucrats as more efficient than income taxes, elites 
have never been able to convince the general population that a sales tax
 is either efficient or fair. Implementing the GST helped to nearly wipe
 out the federal Progressive Conservative party in the 1993 election. 
Stephen Harper won his first election for the reinvented Conservative 
party by promising to lower the hated GST, something he carried through 
despite the strenuous objections of Finance Department bureaucrats. As 
recently as 2011, voters in B.C. refused in a referendum to harmonize 
with the GST, while Albertans remain militantly opposed to any type of 
sales tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Popular resistance to tax
 reform erupted again last summer in response to the overhaul of 
small-business taxes proposed by Finance Minister Bill Morneau. The plan
 was another arcane academic exercise, backed by the <span class="companylink">University of Ottawa</span>'s
 Michael Wolfson. Devising a tax scheme that seemed optimal in principle
 ignored the reality of how the tax would actually affect small 
businesses and farmers, a perfect example of what author Nassim Taleb 
calls the "Intellectual Yet Idiot" phenomenon in his newest book, Skin 
in the Game. Taleb notes that one of the distinct features of this type 
of advice is its complete separation from any consequences. Academics 
freely counsel naïve politicians, but when the plan meets opposition, 
politicians alone face the consequences in the court of public opinion -
 while their scholarly advisors quickly scurry back to their research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 20th century saw 
democracy advance as a result of the increased willingness of the public
 to question the divine right of elites to dictate how our society is 
run. A sea change occurred after the First World War, when the mindless 
slaughter of millions of ordinary soldiers in the trenches of Europe 
made irresistible the working class's demand for broader voting rights. 
As suffrage became more universal, elites have worried incessantly about
 so-called mob rule. Taleb wryly observes that when the population votes
 in a way condoned by the elite, it is approvingly called democracy in 
action; when they vote differently, the ominous spectre of populism is 
raised, never more so than after the election of Donald Trump. That same
 hypocrisy is clearly evident in the debate surrounding a carbon tax. 
The enlightened economists and politicians insist that any opposition to
 taxing carbon is Neanderthal, climate-denying populism. Yet obstructing
 the pipeline it was supposed to facilitate is somehow socially 
responsible and so it goes unsanctioned.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were best summed up 
in 2012 by Trudeau's good friend and current top political advisor, 
Gerald Butts, who said as the then head of the <span class="companylink">World Wildlife Fund Canada</span>: "We don't think there ought to be a carbon-based energy industry by the middle of this century."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suggesting Canada should 
abandon fossil fuels by 2050 revealed a staggering misunderstanding of 
Canadian and global energy needs.</p>

supplied by wind turbines and solar panels because, unlike fossil fuels,
 the power they provide is intermittent. It can't be stored for use when
 needed, nor is it economically feasible, given current technologies, 
without massive subsidies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bitter fruit of 
Trudeau's half-baked ideas about energy are seen today as the PM heads 
off for Peru while his cabinet ministers run away from reporters asking 
what the federal government plans to do to get the stalled Trans 
Mountain pipeline built, a project it says it supports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They resemble deer frozen in the headlights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're caught between 
Trudeau's election pandering to anti-pipeline protesters in B.C. and 
across Canada, and the reality our energy sector provides hundreds of 
thousands of jobs across the country, although not for much longer if we
 can't get our landlocked <b>oil</b> and gas resources to global markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As things stand, B.C.'s NDP Premier John Horgan vows to stop Alberta from shipping its <b>oil</b>
 to the Pacific coast through the Trans Mountain pipeline for export, 
while Alberta's NDP Premier Rachel Notley threatens financial 
retaliation against B.C. and urges Trudeau to do the same.</p>

which was supposed to give him the "<b>social licence</b>" to approve 
pipelines - will achieve our United Nations commitments to meet our 
industrial greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in 2030. Except 
anyone who can add thinks that's impossible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this while federal

 is a government for? Forget bickering over who's a big meanie for not 
wanting to pluck a thick wad from its magic money tree for some 
unfortunate group. If a pipeline can't be built because a province and 
some disgruntled people mock the law, we have to ask, fundamentally, 
what is a government for? When <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada</span>
 declined to put billions more shareholders'dollars at risk on a project
 whose legal approval did not mean it could legally be built, Maude 
Barlow gloattweeted, "Huge good news! <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 suspending all non essential spending on Trans Mountain pipeline!!! 
Resistance matters!" Resistance? Resistance to what? The issue here is 
not pipelines or even fossil fuels. It's the rule of law. You're against
 that? Of course not all laws are just. If they were, nobody would ever 
go about campaigning to change them.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
 But the constant quest to improve both our legislation and our 
political system by holding up current manmade laws against the eternal 
standard of natural law does not begin to justify a "smash and grab" 
approach to public policy, where people act as though everything they 
dislike must secretly be illegal so they get to trespass, shout down 
speakers, break windows or obstruct legally authorized pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you live under 
tyranny, you're entitled to resist by whatever mix of force and fraud 
seems prudent. But Canada is not a tyranny, and to engage in lawbreaking
 when a decision here doesn't go your way is petty, narcissistic and 
incipiently tyrannical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I grant that the Trudeau administration, like a surprising number of conservative politicians and even <b>oil</b> companies, have dug a deep hole by trying to confer "<b>social licence</b>"
 on pipelines by saying the stuff they transport is destroying the 
planet. But that argument should make it easy to forbid them legally. If
 instead you insist that bubble zones around abortion clinics be 
enforced while trespassing to obstruct pipelines, we're just going to 
end up trading blows not because democracy failed us, but because we 
failed it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't like the current pipeline approval process either. But the <span class="companylink">Parliament of Canada</span>
 clearly has the power to set and enforce it under Constitutional 
clauses including S91 generally, S92.2 particularly and S92.10.c. To get
 boringly technical, nothing in S92A or elsewhere lets provinces use 
their legitimate powers as a cloak for usurping federal jurisdiction; 
there's a firm legal maxim that you cannot do indirectly what you are 
forbidden to do directly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OK, it's not boringly 
technical. It gets to the heart of the matter. The preamble to our 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms says "Canada is founded upon principles 
that recognize the supremacy of God and the rule of law." If it's no 
longer true, what's left of the Charter, or the government? The Natural 
Resources minister threatened to call the army on lawbreaking pipeline 
protesters ... in late 2016. We're still waiiiiiiting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a failed <b>oil</b> 
sands tour last week Justin Trudeau told reporters "our job as a 
government is to bring everyone together and say we're all getting what 
we want..." Really? Your job is make-believe? But even if he's the 
prancing dunce we saw in India, are there no adults behind him aware of 
the extent of the crisis and able to find legitimate levers of power and
 pull them? Or are all the levers broken? Alberta Premier Rachel Notley 
notes plaintively that her province has won every court battle over this
 pipeline. But if silly games can stretch judicial proceedings out for 
years, even decades, and ultimately kill their target despite losing 
every time, it's not the rule of law. It's lawlessness in a robe and 
wig.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is a court system 
for, if winning there means nothing? What is an executive for, if it 
cannot enforce the law? What is a federal government for, if its 
jurisdiction is flouted at will? What is a Constitution for, if the rule
 of law is just an empty phrase? It won't do for provinces to retaliate 
against one another, or the feds against a province, like squabbling 
sovereign fiefdoms. I'm all for decentralization. But some things are 
necessarily national, from defence to internal free trade to criminal 
law, or you have no country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We could end up with 
literally no country if we mock resurgent Alberta separation as just 
gun-totin'hicks with hygiene issues. Why stay in a country whose entire 
system of government appears to have no function beyond 
virtue-signalling? Some think instead its key function is redistributing
 money. I beg to differ. But surely everyone right of Maude Barlow knows
 you can't redistribute non-existent money. And business investment is 
fleeing Canada because we seem to be letting the rule of law slip away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we are, why do we have a government? Indeed, do we have one?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the great myths 
circulated by the anti-energy crowd in Canada is that the energy sector 
is heavily subsidized by taxpayers. Instead, as I found in my 2017 study
 for the <span class="companylink">Canadian Taxpayers Federation</span>,
 and as economist and taxation expert Jack Mintz has long argued, the 
claims are inflated based on a misuse of tax expenditure data.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But
 if such taxpayer subsidies are rarer than reflexive energy critics 
assert, it turns out that Alberta Premier Rachel Notley and Alberta 
Opposition Leader Jason Kenney are about to give succour to the critics’
 accusations. Over the weekend, both said the Alberta government should 
take a financial stake in <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>, the company facing continual problems in twinning its Trans Mountain pipeline from Alberta to its terminus in Burnaby, B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, Ms. Notley said, 
“If we have to, Alberta is prepared to do whatever it takes to get this 
pipeline built,” and that included that “Alberta is prepared to be an 
investor” in the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> project.
 On Tuesday, she went a step further and declared she would consider 
buying the pipeline outright. Meanwhile, Mr. Kenney argued that while he
 was “philosophically opposed to corporate welfare,” that a “major 
market failure” had occurred. That, he said, justified an equity stake 
“to ensure economic progress.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let’s dissect both 
positions, but start with Mr. Kenney. There is no “major market 
failure.” Instead, there has been major government interference for more
 than a decade in getting Canada’s natural resources – <b>oil</b>, in 
this case – to markets. In the case of British Columbia, consider former
 premier Christy Clark’s 2012 “five conditions” if any new pipelines 
were to be constructed across B.C (this, as if the province was not 
subject to free-trading requirements in Section 92A(2) of the 
Constitution).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major government 
interference of course continues under the B.C.’s NDP government and the
 City of Burnaby. They are helped along by their anti-resource 
development activist allies on the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lastly, the federal 
government (and despite Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s and Natural 
Resources Minister Jim Carr’s protestations to the contrary) is of 
little help in getting the pipeline built. It is an open secret in 
Calgary that the Trudeau government’s multiple, extra regulatory burdens
 now being imposed on the energy sector mean that even if Trans Mountain
 is built, it will be the last pipeline project, ever. Multiple and 
multiplying regulatory government thickets are the reason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back to equity stakes: In
 addition to why corporate welfare is always a bad deal for taxpayers 
and a risk even when offered through equity, which often turns into a 
loss, an Alberta government financial stake in <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> would change none of the above dynamics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I’ve never believed Ms. Notley was serious in her tactics to force the B.C. government to reverse course on its anti-<b>oil</b> position. It is the same with her latest threats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, if Alberta’s 
leading politicians want to force the matter, and in a way that has 
impact, here are three immodest proposals: First, Ms. Notley should 
introduce legislation that signals her government will repeal the 
Alberta carbon tax. Absent any B.C. government backdown on the pipeline,
 and actual federal efforts to the same end, it is overdue to end the 
charade that Alberta’s carbon tax has enabled so-called <b>social licence</b>. It has not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, Ms. Notley should
 show up in British Columbia and endorse pro-pipeline B.C. Liberal and 
Skeena MLA Ellis Ross, the opposition critic for Natural Gas and 
Petroleum Resources. Political support for Mr. Ross, a former chief 
councillor for the Haisla Nation, would also force the B.C. government 
to go on the defensive vis-à-vis pro-energy First Nations. Ms. Notley’s 
political endorsement of Mr. Ross and betrayal of her same-party 
colleagues in Victoria is the only way to get their attention in a 
substantive way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last, the federal 
government – which likes carbon taxes and claims the authority to impose
 them on provinces, but also claims it wants Trans Mountain to proceed –
 could demonstrate its fealty to both propositions with a simple 
measure: Add $1 a litre to gasoline prices in British Columbia. One 
suspects $2.50 a litre for gasoline in greater Vancouver and nearly 
similar prices elsewhere in British Columbia would focus minds and 
finally provoke a reaction, and perhaps a B.C. government retreat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike an inadvisable equity stake in <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>,
 those three measures would constitute a serious and necessary 
escalation in this dispute. Anything else by politicians in Alberta or 
Ottawa would be useless theatrics.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's the answer to <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s
 decision to pause its Trans Mountain expansion project? Well, if you're
 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the answer is spending $280,000 in 
taxpayers'money for a study to tell you why <b>oil</b> investors are 
backing away from Canada. And if you're Alberta Premier Rachel Notley, 
the answer is demanding that Ottawa give a bailout to oilfield workers 
while your government maybe spends billions it doesn't have investing in
 Trans Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If anything, the 
developments in the last two days prove that not one of the major 
governments involved in the pipeline debate has any clue how jobs are 
created. And not one of the three - the federal Liberals, the Alberta 
NDP and the B.C. NDP - really, truly wants <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> to go ahead. Oh, sure, Premier Notley is doing her finest impersonation of a pro-pipeline politician.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her political future depends on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the energy sector and
 energy workers don't need bailouts and government investment. They need
 our NDP to eliminate its carbon tax, roll back the environmental 
regulations they have introduced and restore the Alberta Advantage. 
Energy-based economies in most of the rest of the world are growing 
strongly without bailouts and government investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Texas and Oklahoma, 
for instance, unemployment is under 4.0 per cent. In North Dakota, it's 
under 3.0. Because there, state governments don't have NDP-like Climate 
Leadership plans that have burdened their energy sectors with billions 
of added taxes and regulations in an effort to buy "<b>social licence</b>." The only <b>oil</b>
 economies that are floundering are those, like Alberta and Venezuela, 
run by lefty governments who think government intervention and public 
spending will spur growth as surely as private innovation and 
investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fastest way to get 
Alberta's economy moving would be for Ottawa, the Alberta NDP and the 
B.C. government of NDP Premier John Horgan to end their obstructionism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And until they do, it's 
doubtful that any amount of federal subsidy or Alberta provincial 
spending can make Trans Mountain go ahead. If the Trudeau government 
ended its new gender-based, Indigenous and ultra-eco assessments of 
energy projects, if it lifted its moratorium on West Coast tanker 
traffic and came out forcefully against B.C.'s delaying tactics and 
against loudmouthed eco-activists, Trans Mountain and other pipelines 
would proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Alberta NDP 
repealed their carbon tax and cancelled their hard cap on oilsands 
emissions and if the B.C. NDP stopped blocking the pipeline at every 
step, Trans Mountain would go ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s decision is not economic, just as <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s decision on Energy East last fall was caused by federal and Quebec politics, not the world price of <b>oil</b>.
 In a conference call with investors on Monday morning, Kinder Morgan 
CEO Steve Kean said something that should give Notley, Trudeau and 
Horgan great pause (but which all three will probably ignore).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kean said his company is considering investments in other pipelines elsewhere, just not in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the sticking point is 
not energy economics - those are pretty good again. The hold up is 
Canadian politics. That should chill Canadians to the bone across the 
country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our country has the third largest reserves of <b>oil</b>
 in the world. Yet we are in danger of being left behind in an 
investment ditch because our "green" federal and provincial leaders are 
clambering over one another to be climate change Boy Scouts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National economic policy is being determined by the ideas of radicals and environmental groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The international market for <b>oil</b>,
 bitumen and natural gas is strong enough to justify Trans Mountain AND 
Energy East AND Keystone XL, and maybe even Northern Gateway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is standing in the way of all of them are "progressive" politicians.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Notley government has spent three years doing everything it can to ruin Alberta's economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has imposed - and then raised - an unwanted carbon tax.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has risked reducing development of the oilsands by imposing a hard cap on emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has raised taxes on 
energy companies, cozied up to the federal Liberals and accelerated the 
shut down of every one of our coal-fired power plants at a tremendous 
cost to Alberta taxpayers and coal communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in the process of paying for this, the NDP are on a path to rack up nearly $100 billion in debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this was done in the name of buying "<b>social licence</b>,"
 the theory that Alberta might win the agreement of the B.C. government 
and environmental activists to build pipelines if we showed a 
willingness to suffer economic pain in the name of saving the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's been all pain and no gain - at least $35 billion in lost investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunday's announcement by <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 that it was suspending any real construction work on its Trans Mountain
 expansion project is proof positive that Rachel Notley's "<b>social licence</b>" is what it has always been - horse droppings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, the premier herself is still drinking the <b>social-licence</b> bathwater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Notley were serious 
about getting pipelines built, at a Sunday news conference she should 
have stepped to the microphone and announced two things: She was 
repealing her government's carbon tax and she was withdrawing Alberta 
from the national climate pact - the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean 
Growth and Climate Change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the name of winning pipeline approvals, Alberta has been beggaring itself. We have been the ones doing ALL of the suffering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's now time for others 
to prove their sincerity to us. Let them seek our co-operation. For 
once, let them show their support for us, rather than Albertans always 
having to be the ones doing the proving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley should have 
suspended her government's carbon tax and ended her co-operation with 
the federal government until others do far more to help. <b>Social licence</b> is getting us nowhere, we should stop spending billions and billions on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But remember, this is the
 same premier who called our province the "embarrassing cousin" of 
Confederation for its environmental record before her. She is the last 
person who is going to back away for her government's disastrous Climate
 Leadership plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If our Peter Pan Prime 
Minister wants Alberta's buy-in on his climate plan and his carbon tax, 
he and his government have to take concrete action to get Trans Mountain
 built, not the other way around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sunday, federal 
Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr called on the B.C. government to 
"end all threats of delay" to Trans Mountain. Ooo, I'll bet that really 
got the NDP government of B.C. Premier John Horgan quaking in their 
loafers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two things: Carr's 
remarks are too little, too late. And how come tough-ish federal 
statements never come from Justin Trudeau? It is not lost on opponents 
of pipelines that Ottawa's tough talk comes from second fiddles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley could also have announced her government was shutting off gasoline shipments to B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If B.C. activists and 
politicians are so concerned about their carbon footprint, we should 
help them by forcing them to abandon their cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But instead of doing any of these things, on Sunday Notley called on Ottawa to offer the <b>oil</b>
 industry a bailout and suggested her government might spend even more 
taxpayer billions helping pay for construction of Trans Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She just doesn't get it.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few hours before Prime Minister Justin Trudeau toured Canada's newest oilsands mine, the head of <span class="companylink">Athabasca <b>Oil</b> Corp</span>. took centre stage at Calgary's Metropolitan Conference Centre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the annual meeting 
Friday of the intermediate oilsands producer, CEO Rob Broen faced 
several questions from shareholders, but few about the company's 
day-to-day operations.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the audience wanted to know about <b>oil</b> pipelines. They asked about Ottawa's new review process for major energy projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And they wanted to know about the general state of the sector's competitiveness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If political leaders had a
 chance to listen in, they would have caught a glimpse into the nervous 
psyche of the industry and its investors today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These pipelines need to 
be built ... we need leadership at a federal level to make sure that 
happens," the CEO said in response to one question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Near as aI can tell, we 
have a tax - we have a carbon tax - but we don't have a pipeline and the
 opponents of those pipelines are more entrenched than they've ever 
been.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So the tax hasn't 
helped." Broen isn't the only oilpatch executive voicing concern about 
the industry's future in the face of complex challenges, such as rising 
production in the United States, the differential facing Canadian heavy 
crude and shifting government policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he quickly became one of the more vocal ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with federal 
approval of the Trans Mountain expansion, patience with slow progress on
 pipelines is wearing thin, although it's not entirely clear what more 
the prime minister can do to help propel these projects along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I would tell him he has 
to show leadership on the pipeline file and it's not just words," Broen 
said when asked what message he would give Trudeau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He needs to see it 
through to construction and make sure we can see shovels in the ground 
and get it built, for the benefit of all Canadians."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such comments underscore the dilemma facing the federal government today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau can repeat over 
and over until he's blue in the face that the project to the west coast 
will get built. But other pipelines, like Energy East, have failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until all of the court 
challenges are cleared, the protesters in Burnaby go home and Trans 
Mountain is finished - now slated for late 2020 - the industry's 
collective anxiety won't abate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Fort McMurray, Trudeau
 toured Suncor Energy's Fort Hills oilsands project and later met with 
leaders of the largest petroleum producers in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suncor CEO Steve Williams
 said he was encouraged after speaking with the prime minister about 
issues such as market access, competitive pressures facing the sector 
and changes to the regulatory system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think we're going to get some help," Williams told reporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau reiterated his support for <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> and spoke about the "terrible price differential that is sucking $15 billion out of the Alberta <b>oil</b> industry because we're not getting global prices" for Canadian crude.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he linked the federal
 government's national price on carbon and increased spending on marine 
safety to his cabinet granting approval to Trans Mountain and Enbridge's
 Line 3 replacement project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pieces all fit 
together. If one link in the chain falls apart, however, it threatens to
 pull down the entire national climate plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are folks out 
there who really like the idea that we're approving the pipelines ... 
but aren't too sure about the carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are other people 
across the Rockies who really like the idea we're moving forward on 
climate change and bringing in a national price on carbon, but aren't 
too sure about moving forward on a pipeline," he told reporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are standing up for Canadians'interests, as well as getting the <b>social licence</b> to get our resources to market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, it's not only pipelines causing heartburn in the <b>oil</b> industry. Leaders are also worried about the flight of capital out of the Canadian sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa now appears to be interested in examining the factors reducing investment in the oilpatch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this week, <span class="companylink">Natural Resources Canada</span> posted a tender for a $275,000 contract, looking for experts to evaluate the competitiveness of the upstream <b>oil</b> and gas sector and examine "recent regulatory changes and major market investment drivers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conducting the report 
suggests there is a willingness by Ottawa to take action, although 
Trudeau himself cautioned Canada "shouldn't be part of a race to the 
bottom."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After meeting with the 
oilsands executives Friday, Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr said the
 issue of industry competitiveness was raised by the CEOs during their 
hour-long session.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have to take very 
seriously what we are hearing from those who are in daily contact with 
investors," Carr said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We also have to keep a view of Canada's long-term competitive advantage."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the promise to build new pipelines, these are positive indicators, although there's no firm action yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The laundry list of concerns strikes to the fundamental issue for Canada's <b>oil</b>
 and gas sector today: Does the federal government really want to see 
the industry thrive and grow into the future? If so, what's it prepared 
to do to see that happen? Political tours, new reports and promises of 
support are welcomed, but there needs to be more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need to see an 
environment where this industry is supported," Broen concluded. Chris

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An interesting <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> thread in recent days has debated the importance of carbon policies, clean technology and the science behind climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the participants are federal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna and United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For
 that reason, Wednesday's release of the Ecofiscal Commission's report 
on the effectiveness of carbon pricing to fight climate was a very 
timely addition to the debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney has voiced his 
party's intent to scrap Alberta's carbon tax and replace it with a 
system of sector-by-sector regulation while McKenna is moving ahead with
 a national carbon price in the absence of provincial programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa intends to implement a $20 per tonne carbon price in January 2019, rising to $50/tonne by 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It remains to be seen if 
Kenney's ideas would satisfy Ottawa, however, and the reality could be 
Alberta will have a carbon tax - whether that's the provincially 
designed system that now exists or a federally imposed one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Either way, there's no escaping a carbon price in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is why the 
Ecofiscal Commission report should be required reading for all 
politicians, carbon price skeptics and the wider population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Especially Albertans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A poll released alongside
 the report showed that of all provinces, Albertans demonstrated the 
lowest support for carbon pricing, at just nine per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's possible some of 
this negative sentiment is tied to the fact the carbon tax was not used a
 bargaining chip to pave the way for a successful outcome in terms of 
pipelines to either the east or west coasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, it was 
not used as a quid pro quo, as some believe should have happened. Yet 
the report's lead author, Chris Ragan, suggests that approach isn't the 
right one, either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ragan said trading carbon pricing for the <b>social licence</b> to build pipelines casts the pipeline as 'bad' - because it will only be built if something 'good' is put in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The truth is the 
pipeline is a good thing. We need carbon pricing to solve one problem 
and we need a pipeline to solve another problem," he said in an 
interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The problem in this 
country is that these two things have become connected and they are 
almost completely disconnected. Our pipelines are about getting our <b>oil</b>
 to a world market that wants (it) and our carbon pricing is about 
making our consumers and our producers more emissions efficient."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This all means there is 
still a lot of work to do in better explaining how carbon pricing works,
 how it does not kill economic growth and why it is better than a 
regulatory approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's report is a step in that direction, while inserting some measured dialogue into a polarizing issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At the moment, Alberta 
is stuck debating for or against the carbon tax - as if there are no 
other options available," said Trevor Tombe , a professor of economics 
at the University of Calgary, citing regulation and technology subsidies
 as alternatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We ought to have that 
conversation regarding how we approach carbon emissions in Alberta 
because as the polls suggest the clear majority prefer action to no 
action; and now we should proceed to debate about the pros and cons of 
different policy tools."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike other reports, 
which Ragan admits were aimed at the policy level, this latest one is 
targeted at answering questions and satisfying skeptics as to why a 
carbon price makes sense, how it changes behaviour and doesn't harm 
economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ecofiscal Commission 
makes its case by using examples from British Columbia, California and 
the United Kingdom, since governments in those jurisdictions put a price
 on carbon. Alberta was not included in the analysis because its program
 has not been in place long enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the point the report -
 and Ragan - make is that it is the most effective method, in terms of 
changing behaviour and cost of implementation compared with a strictly 
regulatory approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Command and control 
regulations generally cost more than carbon pricing because they provide
 far less flexibility to businesses and households, and they typically 
ignore the important differences between them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenge with 
regulations is that companies know better about how to manage their 
operations than do governments - and regulations effectively impose a 
change by governments on how companies do business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A carbon price, on the 
other hand, provides incentives to change how companies operate without 
dictating what that change needs to look like. Net net, as investment 
bankers like to say, it ends up being cheaper than another layer of 
regulation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using B.C. as one example
 of the effectiveness of carbon pricing - Ragan points to the fact 
emissions there have dropped between five and 15 per cent since 2008 and
 the economy has done anything but stall. It should be said that 
province's economic growth has raised emissions on an absolute level, 
although they are lower than would have been the case without a carbon 
tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key factor in the recent success of B.C's economic growth is that its carbon tax was revenue neutral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that, said Tombe, was arguably the most surprising aspect to the polling data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The data showed 63 per 
cent of per cent of people who thought carbon pricing was a bad idea 
would be more supportive if the money was given back ... in the form of 
cutting other taxes by an equal amount. A revenue neutral carbon tax 
makes sense economically and politically," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's report and 
the polling data reinforce two things: action is preferred to no action 
when it comes to addressing climate change and the needle has not moved 
when it comes to energy literacy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is that 
finding common ground from which to solve complex issues such as climate
 change remains a challenge across the country. The latest Ecofiscal 
report is a good effort in constructively re-framing the conversation.</p>

 that reason, Wednesday's release of the Ecofiscal Commission's report 
on the effectiveness of carbon pricing to fight climate was a very 
timely addition to the debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney has voiced his 
party's intent to scrap Alberta's carbon tax and replace it with a 
system of sector-by-sector regulation while McKenna is moving ahead with
 a national carbon price in the absence of provincial programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa intends to implement a $20 per tonne carbon price in January 2019, rising to $50/tonne by 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It remains to be seen if 
Kenney's ideas would satisfy Ottawa, however, and the reality could be 
Alberta will have a carbon tax - whether that's the provincially 
designed system that now exists or a federally imposed one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Either way, there's no escaping a carbon price in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is why the 
Ecofiscal Commission report should be required reading for all 
politicians, carbon price skeptics and the wider population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Especially Albertans. A 
poll released alongside the report showed that of all provinces, 
Albertans demonstrated the lowest support for carbon pricing, at just 
nine per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's possible some of 
this negative sentiment is tied to the fact the carbon tax was not used 
as a bargaining chip to pave the way for a successful outcome in terms 
of pipelines to either the east or west coasts.</p>

Mr. Michael Binnion reports</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTERRE ENGAGES HATCH FOR ENGINEERING ON JORDAN <b>OIL</b> SHALE PROJECT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questerre Energy Corp</span>. has commented on the progress of the internal feasibility study for its <b>oil</b> shale project in Jordan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has recently engaged <span class="companylink">Hatch Ltd</span>.,
 a global engineering firm, to integrate and support its internal work 
on the technical and economic feasibility of this project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, president and chief executive officer, commented: "This
 is an important milestone. Our preliminary feasibility work has been 
completed. It has not identified any red flags or unexpected technical 
challenges. It also suggests this project could be economic at today's <b>oil</b> prices. We are looking forward to the results of the Hatch integration study later this summer to endorse our internal work."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commenting on next steps,
 Mr. Binnion added: "Depending on the results of this integration study,
 we would move to pre-FEED [prefront-end engineering design] 
engineering. These results and the subsequent pre-FEED and FEED 
engineering will form part of the proposed work program for the 
predevelopment phase of a future concession agreement with the Jordanian
 government."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, the 
company completed a review of the last of its nine studies covering all 
four aspects of the production of crude <b>oil</b> from its project in 
Jordan. These include mining and feed preparation, retorting, power, 
including utilities and infrastructure, and marketing and refining. The 
studies were completed by independent engineering firms, including 
Hatch, to develop technical and cost-effective solutions for these 
processes. Due to the size of the existing Jordanian refining 
infrastructure and the market for crude products in Jordan, the company 
has included the costs to upgrade the produced crude <b>oil</b> to 
finished products, including gasoline and diesel. Hatch completed four 
of the nine studies and will integrate all the studies into an 
independent assessment. The design basis for this assessment will be an 
initial project capable of sustaining production of 50,000 barrels per 
day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The feasibility study follows the assessment of the <b>oil</b>
 shale resource completed by an independent qualified resource 
evaluator, Millcreek Mining Group, in accordance with National 
Instrument 51-101 (Standards of Disclosure for <b>Oil</b> and Gas Activities) of the Canadian Securities Administrators and the Canadian <b>oil</b>
 and gas evaluation handbook. The resource assessment estimates a best 
estimate of discovered petroleum initially in place (DPIIP) of between 
7.8 billion and 12.2 billion barrels. The resource assessment was 
prepared in accordance with NI 51-101 and the COGE handbook with an 
effective date of Oct. 1, 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DPIIP was the most 
specific assignable category of resources at the time of the resource 
assessment given the preliminary nature of the resource assessment and 
the nature of recovery of the hydrocarbons by means of mining and 
retorting and given that a program of work to determine commercial 
viability using established technology had not yet been completed. In 
addition, as a result of the preliminary nature of the resource 
assessment, it did not contain any estimates regarding the timing or 
cost to obtain commercial development. The accuracy of resource 
estimates is, in part, a function of the quality and quantity of 
available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and 
judgment. Given the data available at the time, the resource assessment 
was prepared, and the estimates presented therein are considered 
reasonable. The availability of additional data and analysis, after the 
date of the estimates, may necessitate revisions. These revisions may be
 material. There is no certainty that any portion of the resources will 
be discovered. If discovered, there is no certainty that it will be 
commercially viable to produce any portion of the resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more information, including without limitation a description of the Jordan <b>oil</b>
 shale project, the low and high estimates, and the significant positive
 and negative factors in respect of the resource estimates, please see 
the company's press release dated Oct. 27, 2016, and its annual 
information forms available on the company's website and at SEDAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questerre Energy</span> is leveraging its 
expertise gained through early exposure to shale and other 
non-conventional reservoirs. The company has base production and 
reserves in the tight <b>oil</b> Bakken/Torquay of southeast 
Saskatchewan. It is bringing on production from its lands in the heart 
of the high-liquids Montney shale fairway. It is a leader on <b>social licence</b> to operate issues for its Utica shale gas discovery in the St. Lawrence Lowlands in Quebec.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rumours have it the feds will agree to let Alberta's own assessment standards take precedence.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This
 would be a good thing. Even though our NDP's new assessment standards 
are too harsh, they are not as harsh as the ones being proposed by the 
Trudeau government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as nice as this new 
concession from the federal government would be, it's largely 
meaningless so long as the Trudeau government forges ahead with its new 
rules for pipeline construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This latest news has all 
the earmarks of a political trade-off: The federal Liberals will grant 
us permission to develop the oilsands (even though the constitution 
probably didn't require their permission in the first place), but they 
will deny us the pipelines we need to get our <b>oil</b> and bitumen to markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless and until the 
Trudeau government is prepared to withdraw its new assessment standards 
for major pipelines, the "victory" it will grant Alberta over the 
oilsands will be hollow, at best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should the exemption for 
oilsands developments be agreed to, expect a lot of clucking and crowing
 from the Alberta NDP government over how their carbon tax/Climate 
Leadership/"<b>social licence</b>" plan has paid off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Notley government 
will tell us the doubters were wrong; that Premier Rachel Notley's 
co-operation with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau DID work out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if we get only the 
oilsands concession and no change in proposed pipeline legislation, just
 what has the Alberta government achieved? We'll be able to mine bitumen
 and pump <b>oil</b> to our heart's content, but we won't be able to ship it anywhere, except (expensively and inefficiently) by rail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, lawyers 
studying Ottawa's new requirement that all future pipelines be subjected
 to a "genderbased analysis" confess to being confused by just how such 
an analysis would work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just how does "the 
intersection of sex and gender with other identity factors" impact 
pipelines? And, more importantly, how are pipeline companies supposed to
 prove to federal regulators that they have satisfied the gender-based 
tests? Pipeline builders already spend hundreds of millions surveying 
the impact of their projects on people, communities, water, animals, 
plants, even insects - yes, insects - along their proposed routes. But 
now federal approval might hinge on whether construction camps have 
enough female and "gender-diverse" workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if activists tell 
federal regulators they are worried the temporary presence of so many 
male workers will lead to more violence against local women or might 
increase the income gap between the sexes, that might prevent approval, 
too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trudeau government 
isn't backing away, either, from its insistence that Indigenous 
"traditional knowledge" be given equal standing with scientific research
 during the approval process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor is it weakening its 
requirement that pipeline companies account for all the upstream and 
downstream emissions of the products they carry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With all these new 
federal obstacles to pipelines - gender, Indigenous and environmental -

 Alberta New Democrats'propaganda machine normally spits out about six 
to 10 grant announcements a week. But ever since last week's provincial 
budget, it has been in hyperdrive. Now it feels as if there are six or 
10 announcements a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Usually, this consists of
 a press release stating that the Northwest Central Yellowhead Business 
Development Office has received money for solar panels on its office 
roof, followed by NDP claims that this will help put back to work all 
those thousands of residents who have lost their jobs.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this week, the magnitude and frequency of the spending news has been amped up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new school here (and 
there and there and there and there). A grant for energy-intensive 
businesses (to help pay for damage done by the NDP carbon tax). Money to
 clean the carpets and have yesteryear's flocked wallpaper replaced at 
the Northern and Southern Jubilee Auditoriums. A parkand-ride for St. 
Albert's transit commuters. A billion and a half for Edmonton transit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You may have noticed, 
too, that Premier Rachel Notley has been traipsing across the province 
throwing millions, hundreds of millions and billions around as if they 
weren't hers. (Oh, right. They aren't hers.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lots of people have 
wondered if this postbudget self-congratulations frenzy is a last-ditch 
effort by the New Dems to win re-election next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't think so. There's
 no chance the Notley government will win a second term. And I think 
they know that, too. (In unguarded, off-therecord moments, senior New 
Democrats will even admit their party stands almost no chance.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why this spending 
frenzy? The Notley government wants to go out in a blaze of glory. And 
if they can't convince Albertans to vote for them, they're at least 
going to force Albertans to pay for all the government caucus's lefty 
dreams before they're punted from office next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many New Democrats are still obsessed with the idea that Klein-era cuts created huge spending and infrastructure "deficits."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ralph hasn't been premier for more than 11 years. His government stopped making spending cuts nearly 20 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And by the time Klein's 
Tory party left office three years ago, it was spending more per capita 
than any other provincial government, with the possible exception of 
Newfoundland's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heck, today (March 29) is
 the fifth anniversary of Premier Klein's passing. To the extent there 
ever was a spending shortfall under Ralph, it vanished long ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, in a lot of New Dippers'minds, they continue to fight the victim-ofthe-week battles of 1993-94.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are 40 seats 
outside Edmonton and Calgary. The UCP should win 35 to 38, which leaves 
them needing between just six and nine from Alberta's two biggest cities
 to win a majority. They'll get twice that many in Calgary alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Notley NDP see this 
and have decided to buy, fund, build, borrow, slap together, trumpet, 
announce as many projects as they can before their time is up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New polling by energy research firm JWN shows just how unpopular the NDP are, especially among <b>oil</b> and gas executives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forty per cent of energy execs and managers give the Notley government an "F" on <b>oil</b> and gas; another quarter of respondents give them a "D." Just four percent give them an "A."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that's despite all of Notley's recent tough talk on pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The JWN poll also shows that an overwhelming 81 per cent think Notley's "<b>social licence</b>" experiment has utterly failed to get pipelines built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But here's a fun finding: While Notley gets an "F" from 40 per cent of <b>oil</b> and gas CEOs and investors, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Liberals get an "F" from 60 per cent.</p>

 New Democratic government introduced its 2018-19 budget last week, and 
it is likely to be a pivotal moment for the grand and indubitably noble 
cause of democratic socialism, or social democracy, or whatever we're 
calling it now, in Alberta. Our next provincial election is supposed to 
happen, by statute, next spring - "on or before" May 31. If that is how 
things pan out, the New Democrats will get to introduce, and in theory 
run behind, an election budget. But in the meantime, a full year of 
campaigning will have taken place, and will have been conducted on the 
basis of last week's budget.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One
 of the key themes will be carbon taxation. In arguments about the 
Alberta carbon tax, the design of the actual instrument has mostly been 
beside the point until now. The whole idea of taxing carbon, as such, 
strikes at the heart of Alberta's cultural self-identification: to many 
Albertans, raised on tales of Leduc No. 1 and the National Energy 
Program and the Heritage Fund, it is morally offensive in itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta is about 
hydrocarbons in sort of the same deep sense in which Quebec can be 
thought of as being "about" the French language. An Alberta carbon tax 
(a pioneering, world-leading one!) was always going to play, with large 
Alberta audiences, as an act of hysterical self-mortification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP had to know that 
there would be an inherent political price to be paid for its approach -
 that its carbon policy would, for some Albertans, be altogether beyond 
rational discussion. But nobody should underestimate the number of 
Albertans who are at the far opposite end of this spectrum - equally 
beyond reason in the other direction. A lot of Albertans hate that 
Alberta is about hydrocarbons: they go about in a state of constant 
low-level eco-spleen. Almost certainly the business of 
hydrocarbon-digging brought their parents here, or their grandparents, 
but they have grown up with endless propaganda about the species' 
planet-killing error of ever using fossil fuels, and they naturally feel
 trapped or swindled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP's carbon tax 
rhetoric was designed to appeal to those who lie between these two poles
 of irrationality. The United Conservatives have already spent a lot of 
time heckling the New Democrats over their implied promise that a carbon
 tax would provide <b>social licence</b> for pipeline projects that might help Alberta realize un-discounted world prices for ecologically laundered <b>oil</b>. The preferred rebuttal of carbon-tax advocates is that "<b>social licence</b>" is actually <b>oil</b>-industry
 jargon. But there can be no doubt that the carbon tax was designed, and
 politically marketed, on the basis of reputational benefits that have 
not yet panned out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta Finance Minister 
Joe Ceci hugs Premier Rachel Notley after delivering the 2018-19 budget 
in the Alberta Legislature on March 22.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Rachel Notley has talked a pretty good game about Alberta deserving to 
benefit from appropriately taxed carbon-grubbing, but the UCP can show 
that her caucus and her braintrust are full of former splenetics who 
used to wave handmade protest signs about Dirty <b>Oil</b>. The fallback
 argument, for the NDP, is that the carbon tax is a worthwhile incentive
 in itself. The point is not merely to hoover up new revenue, but simply
 to price, and thereby discourage, carbon pollution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be useful for 
the NDP to show, in making this argument, that the tax was wholly 
revenue-neutral - that it was not being used to increase the size of 
government, but was being given back to Albertans. The 2018-19 budget 
makes that part of the case more complicated for them. Under the new 
implied provincial price of $30 per ton of carbon emitted, the revenues 
from carbon taxation are expected to come to about $1.4 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only $525 million of that
 will be handed back to Alberta taxpayers directly, in rebate cheques to
 lower-income households. The government intends to spend more than 
what's left over from that revenue - over a billion dollars - on 
carbon-abatement projects under the Climate Leadership Plan. Close to 
half will go to public transit and other public infrastructure; over 
$200 million will be used to support coal towns being annihilated by the
 decarbonization of Alberta electricity; some of it will go to favoured 
"clean tech" researchers and businesses.</p>

 )</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New Democratic 
narrative will be that this should not really count as a tax grab, 
because the money, having most definitely been grabbed, is to be 
"reinvested" within Alberta. But if the most important point of the 
carbon tax was the price incentive, the NDP could have cut other taxes 
to make it truly revenue-neutral. It could even have provided a bigger, 
even more progressive cash rebate that wasn't a mere fraction of the 
revenue yield. (Mind you, I am aware of no leftist radical anywhere who 
is criticizing the Alberta carbon tax on this basis.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's worse, the federal
 government's umbrella carbon tax plan will increase the implied carbon 
price to $40 a ton in 2021, while passing the money along to Alberta, 
and the NDP's fiscal plan admits that, if it is still in charge, it will
 keep the additional money for use in "general revenue." If you're a 
middle-ground Albertan who is comfortable with a carbon tax as a 
concept, what do you have left to say to anyone who warned that such a 
tax could easily be increased, and might become another way of stiffing 
the taxpayer and increasing government expenditure? This is a surrender 
of moral high ground to essentially religious pro-carbon sentiment: 
those zanies, it seems, warned us of a millennium that is arriving fast.</p>

<span class="companylink">PULSE <b>OIL</b> CORP</span>. ANNOUNCES PHASE 1 OF THE BIGORAY ENHANCED <b>OIL</b> RECOVERY PROJECT IS UNDERWAY + NEW WELL REACTIVATIONS TARGETING LIGHT <b>OIL</b></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Pulse <b>Oil</b> Corp</span>. has initiated phase 1 of the Bigoray Nisku Pinnacle Reef enhanced <b>oil</b> recovery project in the Bigoray area of Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As previously announced on Jan. 9, 2018, and as summarized below, <span class="companylink">Sproule Associates Ltd</span>.,
 an independent qualified reserves evaluator, completed an independent 
resource assessment that includes the Bigoray EOR project potential 
only, and is in addition to the previously disclosed baseline 
independently assessed reserves in the company's core areas at Bigoray 
and Queenstown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sproule assessed a best estimate discovered petroleum initially in place (PIIP) of 23,292,000 barrels of <b>oil</b>
 within Pulse's 100-per-cent-controlled Nisku D and Nisku E Pools, which
 Pulse views as conservative, given the Alberta Regulator lists PIIP as 
26.51 million boe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resource assessment was prepared in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 -- Standards of Disclosure for <b>Oil</b> and Gas Activities of the Canadian Securities Administrators and the Canadian <b>Oil</b> and Gas Evaluation Handbook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulse also announces the 
appointment of a Bigoray EOR project manager, Bill Sawchuk, a 
professional petroleum engineer and an EOR expert to oversee all 
technical and planning aspects of the EOR program. Mr. Sawchuk has over 
20 years of experience as a senior engineering manager and a technical 
expert in reservoir engineering and enhanced <b>oil</b> recovery methods. Mr. Sawchuk has previously served as an exploitation engineer for Anderson Exploration Ltd. and <span class="companylink">Devon Canada Corp</span>.,
 and most recently, as manager of engineering for ARC Resources Ltd., 
where he led teams to optimize production and implement valuable 
enhanced <b>oil</b> recovery projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulse is excited that 
initial critical facility aspects of the Bigoray EOR project are now 
under way, using working capital on hand in preparation for the EOR 
injection phase to be implemented in 2018 as planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phase 1 of the EOR 
project, which includes reactivation of existing injection facilities, 
will also allow Pulse to cost-effectively reactivate up to three current
 shut-in <b>oil</b> producers to add approximately 400 barrels of <b>oil</b> equivalent per day (100-per-cent working interest) of new light <b>oil</b> and gas production prior to the EOR project taking place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Cadenhead, president and chief operating officer of Pulse <b>Oil</b>,
 commented: "We are eagerly awaiting the Bigoray EOR project to be fully
 under way later this year and the start of phase 1 is a very low-cost 
starting point; it's really exciting for everyone involved. This 
critical facility work not only marks the start of the EOR project for 
us, it allows us to get additional shut-in production reactivated in the
 near-term while we prepare for the water injection phase of the project
 in 2018. This interim production boost will provide additional revenues
 which will be reinvested in the Bigoray EOR program later this year as 
planned."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Independent resource assessment details</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sproule independent 
resource assessment provides estimates categorized as high, best and low
 for contingent resources associated with the Bigoray EOR project on the
 two pools, with the unrisked high estimate being 8.07 million boe (92.6
 per cent <b>oil</b>), a best estimate of 6.136 million boe (91.3 per cent <b>oil</b>) and a low estimate of 3.668 million boe (89.1 per cent <b>oil</b>).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, the 
resource assessment prepared by Sproule calculated risked contingent 
resources where the risked assessment assigned a 77-per-cent chance of 
Pulse proceeding with the EOR project and resulting in a best estimate 
of risked contingent resources net to Pulse of 4,694,000 boe (91.2 per 
cent <b>oil</b>).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cadenhead commented: 
"The Sproule resource assessment is a positive independent commercial 
confirmation for our Bigoray Nisku enhanced <b>oil</b> recovery project.
 Although this assessment used a more conservative approach to petroleum
 initially in place compared with the PIIP estimates of the Alberta 
energy regulator, we are excited to see that even this more conservative
 approach resulted in a strong endorsement for the project. With an 
independent unrisked high-case upside estimated at over eight million 
boe of contingent resources (92 per cent <b>oil</b>), the opportunity to
 move forward with our EOR project to bring on stream substantial cash 
flow while targeting to recover those types of <b>oil</b> volumes without drilling a well, creates a substantial opportunity to enhance value for Pulse and our shareholders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resource assessment 
focused exclusively on two Nisku pools only in the Bigoray area, and 
included just 2,720 acres of Pulse's 44,720-acre core area holdings 
which includes 14,000 acres at Bigoray alone. Future evaluations may be 
done on Pulse's Mannville, Cardium and Pekisko formations that are 
thought to also provide significant growth opportunities for the company
 as well as additional Nisku assets/pools held within Pulse's existing 
holdings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cadenhead further 
added: "As part of the resource assessment, the evaluator assessed a 
total risk of 77 per cent that the project would proceed, citing 
economic factors and/or timing of development as one of the only risks 
associated with the project. All technical risks such as evaluation 
drilling, regulatory approvals, technology, legal factors, 
infrastructure and markets, political factors, and <b>social licence</b> were all assigned 100 per cent chance of commerciality. Our goal is to make this project happen in 2018 and with the <b>oil</b>
 prices holding firmly above $60 (U.S.) WTI pricing, the economics of 
this EOR project and return for shareholders continue to look more and 
more attractive alongside improving <b>oil</b> prices."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resource assessment 
is based on the results from 17 wells and, where available, core data. 
Where core was not available, the assessment considered log data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent resource 
volumes for these discovered resources have been classified as 
"development unclarified" with Sproule assessing that there is a high 
probability of the Bigoray EOR project becoming a commercial 
development. Pulse will continue to complete project planning associated
 with the project and move forward with its execution plans in 2018.</p>

Pulse has initiated Phase 1 of the Bigoray Nisku Pinnacle Reef Enhanced <b>Oil</b> Recovery ("EOR") project in the Bigoray area of Alberta ("Bigoray").</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As previously announced on January 9, 2018, and as summarized below, <span class="companylink">Sproule Associates Limited</span>
 ("Sproule"), an independent qualified reserves evaluator, completed an 
independent resource assessment that includes the Bigoray EOR project 
potential only, and is in addition to the previously disclosed baseline 
independently assessed reserves in the Company's core areas at Bigoray 
and Queenstown.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sproule assessed a best estimate Discovered Petroleum Initially in-Place (PIIP) of 23.292 million barrels of <b>oil</b>
 ("boe") within Pulse's 100% controlled Nisku D and Nisku E Pools, which
 Pulse views as conservative, given the Alberta Regulator lists PIIP as 
26.51 million boe's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Resource Assessment was prepared in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 –Standards of Disclosure for <b>Oil</b> and Gas Activities&nbsp;of the Canadian Securities Administrators ("NI 51-101") and the Canadian <b>Oil</b> and Gas Evaluation Handbook ("COGE Handbook").</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more information on the Sproule independent resource assessment, please see "Independent Resource Assessment Details" below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulse also announces the 
appointment of a Bigoray EOR Project Manager, Bill Sawchuk, a 
Professional Petroleum Engineer and an EOR expert to oversee all 
technical and planning aspects of the EOR program. With over 20 years 
of&nbsp;experience as a senior engineering manager and a technical 
expert in reservoir engineering and enhanced <b>oil</b> recovery methods. Bill has previously served as an Exploitation Engineer for Anderson Exploration Ltd. and <span class="companylink">Devon Canada Corporation</span>
 and most recently, as Manager of Engineering for ARC Resources Ltd. 
where he led teams to optimize production and implement valuable 
Enhanced <b>Oil</b> Recovery projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulse is excited that 
initial critical facility aspects of the Bigoray EOR project are now 
underway, using working capital on hand in preparation for the EOR 
Injection Phase to be implemented in 2018 as planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phase 1 of the EOR 
project ("Phase 1"), which includes re-activation of existing injection 
facilities, will also allow Pulse to cost-effectively reactivate up to 3
 current shut-in <b>oil</b> producers to add approximately 400 BOE/d (100% working interest) of new light <b>oil</b> and gas production prior to the EOR project taking place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Cadenhead, President and COO of Pulse <b>Oil</b>,
 commented, "We are eagerly awaiting the Bigoray EOR project to be fully
 underway later this year and the start of Phase 1 is a very low-cost 
starting point; it's really exciting for everyone involved.&nbsp; This 
critical facility work not only marks the start of the EOR project for 
us, it allows us to get additional shut-in production re-activated in 
the near-term while we prepare for the water injection phase of the 
project in 2018. This interim production boost will provide additional 
revenues which will be reinvested in the Bigoray EOR program later this 
year as planned."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Independent Resource Assessment Details:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sproule Independent 
Resource Assessment provides estimates categorized as "high", "best" and
 "low" for contingent resources associated with the Bigoray EOR project 
on the two pools, with the unrisked high estimate being 8.07 million boe
 (92.6% <b>Oil</b>), a best estimate of 6.136 million boe (91.3% <b>Oil</b>) and a low estimate of 3.668 million boe (89.1% <b>Oil</b>).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, the 
Resource Assessment prepared by Sproule calculated risked contingent 
resources where the risked assessment assigned a 77% chance of Pulse 
proceeding with the EOR project (see Table 2 below) and resulting in a 
best estimate of risked contingent resources net to Pulse of 4.694 
million boe (91.2% <b>Oil</b>).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Cadenhead, President and COO of Pulse <b>Oil</b>, commented, "The Sproule Resource Assessment is a positive independent commercial confirmation for our Bigoray Nisku Enhanced <b>Oil</b>
 Recovery project. Although this assessment used a more conservative 
approach to Petroleum Initially in-Place ("PIIP") compared with the PIIP
 estimates of the Alberta Energy Regulator, we are excited to see that 
even this more conservative approach resulted in a strong endorsement 
for the project. With an independent un-risked high case upside 
estimated at over 8 million boe's of contingent resources (92% <b>oil</b>),
 the opportunity to move forward with our EOR project to bring on stream
 substantial cashflow while targeting to recover those types of <b>oil</b> volumes without drilling a well, creates a substantial opportunity to enhance value for Pulse and our shareholders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Resource Assessment 
focussed exclusively on two Nisku pools only in the Bigoray area, and 
included just 2,720 acres of Pulse's 44,720 acre core area holdings 
which includes 14,000 acres at Bigoray alone. Future evaluations may be 
done on Pulse's Mannville, Cardium and Pekisko formations that are 
thought to also provide significant growth opportunities for the Company
 as well as additional Nisku assets/pools held within Pulse's existing 
holdings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cadenhead further 
added, "As part of the Resource Assessment, the evaluator assessed a 
total risk of 77% that the project would proceed, citing economic 
factors and/or timing of development as one of the only risks associated
 with the project. All technical risks such as&nbsp;evaluation drilling,
 regulatory approvals, technology, legal factors, infrastructure and 
markets, political factors and <b>social licence</b> were all assigned 100% chance of commerciality.&nbsp;Our goal is to make this project happen in 2018 and with the <b>oil</b>
 prices holding firmly above US$60 WTI pricing, the economics of this 
EOR project and return for shareholders continue to look more and more 
attractive alongside improving <b>oil</b> prices." &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Resource Assessment 
is based on the results from seventeen wells and, where available, core 
data. Where core was not available, the assessment considered log data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resource 
volumes for these discovered resources have been classified as 
'development unclarified' with Sproule assessing that there is a high 
probability of the Bigoray EOR project becoming a commercial 
development. Pulse will continue to complete project planning associated
 with the project and move forward with its execution plans in 
2018.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resources encompasses all
 petroleum quantities that originally existed on or within the earth's 
crust in naturally occurring accumulations, including Discovered and 
Undiscovered (recoverable and unrecoverable) plus quantities already 
produced. "Total Resources" is equivalent to "Total Petroleum Initially 
In-Place". Resources are classified in the following categories:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total Petroleum Initially
 In-Place ("TPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is estimated to 
exist originally in naturally occurring accumulations. It includes that 
quantity of petroleum that is estimated, as of a given date, to be 
contained in known accumulations, prior to production, plus those 
estimated quantities in accumulations yet to be discovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovered Petroleum 
Initially In-Place ("DPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is 
estimated, as of a given date, to be contained in known accumulations 
prior to production. The recoverable portion of DPIIP includes 
production, reserves, and Contingent Resources; the remainder is 
unrecoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources are 
those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established 
technology or technology under development but which are not currently 
considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more 
contingencies. Economic Contingent Resources (ECR) are those contingent 
resources that are currently economically recoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undiscovered Petroleum 
Initially In Place ("UPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is 
estimated, on a given date, to be contained in accumulations yet to be 
discovered. The recoverable portion of UPIIP is referred to as 
Prospective Resources and the remainder is unrecoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective Resources are
 those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application 
of future development projects. Prospective Resources have both an 
associated chance of discovery and a chance of development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unrecoverable is that 
portion of DPIIP and UPIIP quantities which is estimated, as of a given 
date, not to be recoverable by future development projects. A portion of
 these quantities may become recoverable in the future as commercial 
circumstances change or technological developments occur; the remaining 
portion may never be recovered due to the physical/chemical constraints 
represented by subsurface interaction of fluids and reservoir rocks. 
Uncertainty Ranges are described by the Canadian <b>Oil</b> and Gas Evaluation Handbook as low, best, and high estimates for reserves and resources as follows:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low Estimate: This is 
considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities
 recovered will exceed the low estimate. If probabilistic methods are 
used, there should be at least a 90 percent probability (P90) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the low estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best Estimate: This is 
considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will actually be
 recovered. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities 
recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate. If 
probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50 percent 
probability (P50) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or 
exceed the best estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High Estimate: This is 
considered to be an optimistic estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual remaining 
quantities recovered will exceed the high estimate. If probabilistic 
methods are used, there should be at least a 10 percent probability 
(P10) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the 
high estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development Unclarified 
is a project maturity sub-class of contingent resources that refers to 
the development plan evaluation is not complete and there is ongoing 
activity to resolve any risks or uncertainties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certain resource estimate
 volumes disclosed herein are arithmetic sums of multiple estimates of 
DPIIP or UPIIP, which statistical principles indicate may be misleading 
as to volumes that may actually be recovered. Readers should give 
attention to the estimates of individual classes of resources and 
appreciate the differing probabilities of recovery associated with each 
class as explained under this&nbsp;Resource Definitions&nbsp;section.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 throne speech that marked the opening of the legislature earlier this 
month was clearly aimed at more than just Albertans. One of its key 
themes was the need to get our <b>oil</b> to tidewater, where it will 
fetch a higher price than fuel sold to the United States, which is where
 the great majority of our energy is exported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The speech, read by 
Lt.-Gov. Lois Mitchell, had British Columbians in mind; in particular, 
Premier John Horgan, who has voiced strong opposition to the Trans 
Mountain pipeline.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The
 dispute British Columbia triggered with its attack on Canadian workers 
will not stand," the government said in the speech. "We won't let it. We
 have been vigilant in defending our workers and we will remain 
vigilant."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a well-crafted 
message, but when the government's budget is released Thursday 
afternoon, the Rachel Notley government must ensure Albertans'interests 
are at the heart of its fiscal blueprint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since coming to power in 
2015, the NPD has posted irresponsible deficits. Its predecessor, the 
Conservative party, also failed to balance the books under successive 
premiers, but there was nothing like the NDP has done in the supposed 
defence of front-line services such as health care and education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP has spent 
taxpayer money with abandon, to the point that credit agencies, which 
determine how much Albertans will pay in interest on the massive amount 
of borrowing, have downgraded the province's rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP is clearly an 
ally of the organized labour movement, but it needs to expand its reach 
and popularity if it hopes to win re-election next spring. Many 
Albertans are seeking some financial prudence as opposed to the spending
 free-for-all we've been witness to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worryingly, that's not 
likely to be the case when Thursday's budget is revealed. Finance 
Minister Joe Ceci said Tuesday the document will include anticipated 
revenue from expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, apparently with 
the aim of balancing the budget within five years - well after the next 
election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No sensible homeowner 
would cobble together a budget with the assumption they'd be getting a 
pay increase in a few years. And yet this is what passes for NDP 
mathematics - the hope that having imposed a punitive carbon tax on its 
citizens to win so-called <b>social licence</b> for pipelines, that 
politicians who are indifferent to energy infrastructure, or openly 
oppose them, are going to facilitate the flow of billions of dollars 
into Alberta's coffers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP have proven to be
 poor money managers, but surely we're not to have faith in such wild 
speculation. Opposition Leader Jason Kenney sees the danger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We obviously hope that 
Trans Mountain gets built quickly, but what we've seen is a year of 
delays already and the very strong potential of yet further delays," 
said the United Conservative Party leader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is putting a lot of eggs in one uncertain basket, and that's not how you budget."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government should 
focus instead on reducing costs. Last year's budget projected that by 
2020, Alberta's debt will be $70 billion - which is the equivalent of 
$16,500 for every person in the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists Janice 
MacKinnon and Jack Mintz argue that Alberta can learn lessons from other
 provinces, such as Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia, which spent an
 average of $9,233 per capita last year on services. Alberta spent 
$12,409 per person - that's $3,176 more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In health care alone, 
they note, Alberta spends $915 more per capita than the average of the 
other three large provinces, which means spending $3.8 billion more 
annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP shouldn't put 
revenue from incompleted pipelines in its ledgers. It should engage in 
the thoughtful work Albertans elected them to do and focus on reducing 
expenses.</p>

<span class="companylink">Greenfields Petroleum Corp</span>. has 
released the resource assessment report of gross contingent and gross 
prospective resources (the ERCE report), which was prepared by ERC 
Equipoise Ltd., an independent, qualified reserves evaluator. 
Greenfields has also provided an update on its production results for 
the year ended Dec. 31, 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ERCE report</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ERCE report assesses 
the contingent resources in the Bahar Fasila waterflood project and the 
prospective resources in the Gum Deniz Miocene prospect. The ERCE report
 is dated and effective as of March 2, 2018. The independent assessment 
was carried out in accordance with the standards and the resources 
definitions contained in the Canadian <b>Oil</b> and Gas Evaluation 
Handbook as established by the Canadian Securities Administrators in 
National Instrument 51-101 -- Standards of Disclosure for <b>Oil</b> and
 Gas Activities, and consistent with the classification and reporting 
requirements of the March 2007 SPE/EPC/AAPG/SPEE Petroleum Resources 
Management System. The tables in this news release summarize certain 
information contained in the ERCE report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Waterflood development</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bahar Energy Ltd. plans 
to initiate a waterflood of the FS reservoir in Bahar in 2019, starting 
with the implementation of five waterflood pilots. Assuming a positive 
reservoir response to the pilot flood, a full-scale water-injection 
project would be implemented by Bahar Energy. Initially, the drilling of
 two down-dip injection wells located in the water leg of the FS 
reservoir would be carried out. The drilling of a total of nine 
injection wells is planned over a five-year period from three existing 
platforms and one new platform to be constructed on the western flank of
 the reservoir.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent resources for 
the planned pilot water injection followed by a water flood of the Bahar

(1) Contingent resources are estimates of volumes that are potentially recoverable from known accumulations 
using established technology or technology under development, but which are not currently considered to be 
commercially recoverable due to one or more contingencies.
(2) The volumes reported are risked in the sense that they have been adjusted for chance of development. 
The chance of development is defined as the probability of a project being commercially viable. Quantifying 
the chance of development requires consideration of both economic contingencies and other contingencies, 
such as legal, regulatory, market access, political, <b>social licence</b>, internal and external approvals, and 
commitment to project finance and development timing. As many of these factors are extremely difficult to 
quantify, the chance of development is uncertain and must be used with caution. ERCE determined that a 
70-per-cent chance of development is appropriate for the contingent resources.
(3) Gross contingent resources are all volumes estimated to be recoverable from the field without any 
economic cut-off being applied. Gross weight interest contingent resources is adjusted for the company's 
80-per-cent working interest fraction of the gross contingent resources. net contingent resources are 
adjusted for the company's working interest share after deduction of royalty obligations.
(4) Project maturity for contingent resources has been classified as development unclarified.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has mapped a 
significant structural closure at Miocene level at a depth of between 
4,000 metres and 4,500 metres (subsea) based on 3-D seismic. The 
prospective horizon is located beneath the <b>oil</b>-producing reservoirs of the Gum Deniz <b>oil</b>
 field and this horizon has not yet been penetrated by a well in the 
Bahar purchase and sale agreement. The company is also monitoring the 
drilling of the Absheron Operating Co. (AOC) Miocene well test, which is
 located approximately four kilometres northeast of the Bahar project. 
The well is being drilled from the same surface location as the 2015 
Hovsan 1870 gas discovery well, which reportedly encountered 
high-pressure gas of 16 million standard cubic feet per day and 
condensate of 640 barrels per day in the top of the Miocene at 
approximately 4,600 metres (subsea). The well reportedly also 
encountered high bottom-hole pressures in excess of 11,000 pounds per 
square inch.</p>

(1) The table has been disclosed consistent with the classification and reporting requirements of PRMS.
(2) Gross unrisked prospective resources are all volumes estimated to be recoverable from an accumulation. 
There is no equivalent COGEH definition.
(3) Net unrisked prospective resources are the company's working interest fraction of the gross unrisked 
prospective resources. The equivalent COGEH definition is gross working interest prospective resources, 
which is the company's working interest fraction in prospective resources prior to the deduction of 
royalties.
(4) Net risked prospective resources are the company's working interest fraction of the net unrisked 
prospective resources multiplied by the geological chance of success.  The COS is an estimate of the 
probability that drilling the prospect would result in a discovery as defined under PRMS. ERCE has 
assigned a chance of success of 32 per cent to the prospective resources. Under COGEH, prospective 
resources are risked by a chance of commerciality, being the product of the chance of development and 
the chance of discovery. For further detail, see notes (2) to (4) of the table entitled, "Prospective 
Resources, Gum Deniz Miocene Prospect."
(5) Prospective resources are both unrisked in that they have not been multiplied by the COS and risked 
in that the volumes have been multiplied by the COS.

(1) Prospective resources are estimates of volumes that are potentially recoverable from undiscovered 
accumulations by application of future development projects.
(2) The volumes reported here are risked in the sense that they have been adjusted for the chance of 
commerciality, being the product of the chance of development and the chance of discovery. ERCE 
determined that a 32-per-cent chance of commerciality is appropriate for the prospective resources.
(3) The chance of development is defined as the probability of a project being commercially viable. 
Quantifying the chance of development requires consideration of both economic contingencies and other 
contingencies, such as legal, regulatory, market access, political, <b>social licence</b>, internal and 
external approvals, and commitment to project finance and development timing. As many of these factors 
are extremely difficult to quantify, the chance of development is uncertain and must be used with 
caution.
(4) The chance of discovery is defined as the probability the exploration activities will confirm the 
existence of a significant accumulation of potentially recoverable resources. Quantifying the chance 
of discovery requires consideration of certain risks including the chance of success of a play, the 
chance of success of the prospect-specific properties and the prospect-specific properties qualities 
being sufficient to result in a commercially viable discovery. As many of these factors are extremely 
difficult to quantify, the chance of development is uncertain and must be used with caution.
(5) Gross prospective resources are all of the volumes estimated to be recoverable from the field 
without any economic cut-off being applied. Gross weighted average prospective resources is adjusted 
for the company's 80-per-cent working interest fraction of the gross prospective resources. Net 
prospective resources are adjusted for the company's working interest share after deduction of 
royalty obligations.

opportunity in the Fasila horizon in the Bahar field and a significant 
Miocene exploration objective beneath the Gum Deniz <b>oil</b> field that can be drilled from Gum Island with a suitable land-based rig, with combined original <b>oil</b>-in-place estimates in excess of a hundred million barrels of <b>oil</b> equivalent if a discovery is made."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The associated table and

 actual results of production for the year ended Dec. 31, 2017. The 
original guidance was disclosed by the company in a press release dated

</pre>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reason for variance</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The primary factors 
contributing to lower than expected production were: (i) the slower pace
 of executing scheduled workovers, reflecting, in part, limited access 
to heavy-lift vessels; (ii) the lower than expected postworkover 
production rates; and (iii) the slow pace of south Gum Deniz electric 
submersible pump (ESP) installations as workovers in old wellbores 
required additional cleaning and scraping runs. The corporation plans to
 address the limited access to heavy-lift vessels through the 
acquisition of a heavier rig that is better suited to deal with the 
challenges imposed by the old wells and difficult workovers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, Bahar 
Energy Operating Co. Ltd. elected to defer both capital and operating 
expenditures until the development plan and reservoir studies were 
completed, which would further facilitate the delineation and selection 
of the best projects going forward. The reservoir studies were initially
 expected to be completed by April 2017, in respect of the gas field, 
and by midyear 2017, in respect of the <b>oil</b> field. However, the 
studies were not completed until the first quarter of 2018 as a result 
of the identification of development opportunities (particularly 
waterfloods), additional evaluation work requested by the reserve 
auditors (<span class="companylink">GLJ Petroleum Consultants</span> and
 ERCE), and data inconsistencies resulting from scribed logs and well 
files that required clarification and further delineation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In light of 
lower-than-expected production, the company revised its 2017 budget, 
resulting in downward adjustments to capital expenditures to 
$9.7-million (from guidance of $21-million (U.S.)) and operating 
expenses to $23-million (from guidance of $28-million (U.S.)). The 
deferral of projected expenditures intended to increase gross lease 
production from 4,167 barrels of <b>oil</b> equivalent per day at Dec. 
31, 2016, resulted in the realization of approximately 24 per cent less 
revenue than originally expected by the company.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A judge in Johannesburg

night by a vehicle that had a human attendant aboard but was operating 
in autonomous mode. Uber issued a statement saying “our hearts go out to
 the victim’s family.” In the transportation industry, such a death was 
widely considered inevitable as the number of self-driving vehicles

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Canada is timidly back. The Liberal government announced the return to <span class="companylink">UN peacekeeping</span>
 in a timorous voice. In a press scrum, Foreign Affairs Minister 
Chrystia Freeland let slip that caution is the watchword for the mission
 that Canadian Forces will take on in Mali. The government, she said, 
wanted to make ‘a real contribution in as careful a way as possible.’ 
That was an apt description for what Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan 
announced: Two transport helicopters and four attack helicopters will be
 sent to Mali, with crews, support troops and medical staff. It’s not 
boots on the ground, in the sense that Canadian troops won’t patrol 
dangerous areas of Mali, a country where Islamist terrorists harass 
civilians and have killed 99 United Nations peacekeepers so far. It is

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The coming carbon tax showdown</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Not so long ago, Justin 
Trudeau’s energy strategy looked so simple. It rested on a Grand

 penance in the form of carbon taxes that would reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions. Everybody –environmentalists, the <b>oil</b> industry and 
right-thinking Canadians – would be happy. Today, that bargain is 
looking mighty shaky. Opponents of Trans Mountain aren’t interested in 
it. Alberta’s Premier, Rachel Notley, will probably lose her job next 
year because she has delivered carbon taxes but no pipeline. Her 
nemesis, Jason Kenney, is planning to abolish the carbon tax as soon as 
he beats her (as is likely). He points out that it has utterly failed to
 secure a <b>social licence</b> for pipelines ... And now, the

 victims’ suffering under the rug. It has offered a long overdue voice 
to the vulnerable in an unprecedented way. But its unintended side 
effect has only further polarized the issue of sexual assault, 
distilling it down to blindly taking sides, irrespective of whether 
doing so actually moves us forward.” — Debra Soh</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rita Joe dies</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">March 20, 2007- They 
called her Gentle Warrior. But the woman known as the poet laureate of 
the Mi’kmaq people had battle scars, earned from childhood. Rita Bernard
 was born in Whycocomagh, Cape Breton, on March 15, 1932. Her mother 
died when she was 5; her father when she was 10. She lived in numerous 
foster homes and suffered abuse. At 12, she arrived at Shubenacadie 
Indian Residential School. She thought it looked like a castle; later, 
she compared it to prison. After four years there, she had to relearn 
Mi’kmaq, her native language, as she later recounted in her poem, I Lost
 My Talk. She eventually married Frank Joe and they raised eight 
children, including two foster children. “Only a housewife with a 
dream,” as she described herself, she began writing in her 30s. But she 
went on to publish seven books, including an autobiography, Song of Rita
 Joe, and was awarded the Order of Canada. I Lost My Talk eventually 
became the basis for a <span class="companylink">National Arts Centre</span>
 show and was quoted in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission report. 
“Let me find my talk, so I can teach you about me,” it ends. Rita Joe

 for pipelines. “Very expensive political theatre for Albertans," he 
calls it. And now, the anti-carbon-tax crusader Doug Ford could well 
become premier of Ontario. It's hard to see how Mr. Trudeau will impose 
his grand bargain on the provinces if Alberta and Ontario are in open 
revolt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what about the rest of us?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liberals, 
environmentalists and economists tell us carbon taxes are a virtually 
painless way to get us to act virtuously, by cutting down on fossil 
fuels. They are a good tax. Unfortunately, too many of us don't like 
them anyway. As Mr. Ford likes to say whenever he has a chance, “A tax 
is a tax is a tax."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carbon taxes are 
allegedly revenue-neutral because the money is returned to taxpayers in 
the form of rebates or offset by lower taxes elsewhere. But the reality 
is different. In fact, governments can't keep their greedy mitts off the
 money. Even the model province of British Columbia is now diverting 
part of its provincial carbon tax to fund tax credits for preferred 
groups, such as filmmakers. In Alberta, only about a quarter of the 
amount raised by the carbon tax is rebated to taxpayers. Sadly, there is
 a vast difference between the pure world of economic models and the 
grubby world of politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another problem with 
carbon taxes is that you can't possibly make them high enough to be 
effective. If you did you'd be voted out of office. Mr. Trudeau's 
national carbon pricing scheme would start at $10 a tonne, going up to 
$50 by 2022 – enough to be a nuisance, but not nearly enough to affect 
consumer behaviour in any meaningful way. Achieving real behavioural 
change, environmental economists say, would cost many times more. 
According to Simon Fraser University economist Mark Jaccard, carbon 
taxes can only have real impact if governments also introduce a bunch of
 costly and heavy-handed regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, carbon 
taxes can't save the planet. Despite what politicians tell you, they 
basically amount to useless virtuesignalling. But Mr. Trudeau, Ms. 
Notley and Environment Minister Catherine McKenna aren't going to tell 
you this because they want you to believe they have a plan and that the 
plan will work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the date for Mr. 
Trudeau's carbon tax gets closer, taxpayers might start asking an even 
more basic question: What difference will this make in the big scheme of
 things? As India and China and the whole developing world increase 
energy use, and the United States extracts more fossil fuel than ever in
 its history, why are we getting this darn tax?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no good answer 
for that. The gap between reality and our intentions is unfathomably 
vast. To avoid the most serious effects of global warming, we should be 
adding about 1,100 megawatts of clean-energy capacity a day – equivalent
 to one nuclear power plant – according to the the MIT Technology 
Review. What we're actually adding: 151 megawatts a day. The 
technologies that are needed to cut emissions deeply simply haven't been
 developed yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“[V]irtually all sober 
analyses conclude that the target [of two degrees of warming] is now 
unobtainable," climate expert Ted Nordhaus wrote in Foreign Affairs. But
 don't blame venal politicians or evil industry. The root of the problem
 is much more basic, he argues: “Decarbonization is hard." He calls the 
insistence that we can meet the 2 C threshold a dangerous delusion that 
distracts us from what we can do to address the changes that are coming

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there's one thing I hope all Albertans can agree on, it's the desperate need for more pipelines to get our abundant <b>oil</b>
 and gas resources to market. According to recent reports, Alberta is 
losing $7 billion per year because of lack of pipeline capacity, with 
industry losing $6.7 billion more annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While we disagree with 
how the NDP has handled the strategy surrounding the Trans Mountain 
expansion, we don't doubt the need for the pipeline.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It
 wasn't that long ago when pipelines were built in this country with 
little controversy. Under the previous Harper government, four major 
pipeline projects were completed. Keystone, Alberta Clipper, the Line 9 
reversal and Anchor Loop were all successfully completed under the 
previous government, adding 1.73 million barrels per day of capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, it is true that none
 of these projects were to tidewater, as the NDP is happy to point out. 
But Trans Mountain was not up for government approval under the previous
 Conservative government. The NDP's cousins in Ottawa would no doubt 
have howled if the Harper government dared to short circuit the 
regulatory process by approving a pipeline before a thorough review was 
completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northern Gateway, the one
 tidewater pipeline up for decision under the Harper Conservatives, was 
indeed approved. Sadly, the project was retroactively cancelled by the 
Trudeau Liberals as part of their plan to ban tanker traffic off B.C.'s 
northern coast (never mind that Alaskan tankers have travelled down that
 route for decades). And the Trudeau Liberals later rigged the approval 
process midstream to scuttle Energy East, another pipeline to tidewater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, radical activists have engaged in a concerted effort to specifically target and sideline Canada's <b>oil</b>
 and gas industry. Millions of dollars of foreign funding have flooded 
into the Canadian environmental movement with the clear goal of starving
 our resources of markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta NDP government promised that imposing a carbon tax on Albertans would buy so-called <b>social licence</b>
 in B.C. for a pipeline to the Pacific. We are baffled the Alberta 
government bought this argument, since it's their fellow travellers - 
both the B.C. NDP and radical environmental activists such as Tzeporah 
Berman - who are leading the fight against the approved Trans Mountain 
expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surely, the Alberta NDP 
understood that their friends would not be willing to trade a carbon tax
 for a pipeline. In fact, Premier Rachel Notley finally acknowledged 
this reality in a recent interview with <span class="companylink">CBC Radio</span>.
 When asked why not put a hold on the carbon tax until the pipeline 
begins construction, she responded, "quite honestly, I don't know that 
B.C. would care one way or another if we did that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The truth is that the 
Trudeau Liberals provided paper regulatory approval for the pipeline, 
purportedly because of Alberta's willingness to impose a carbon tax on 
its citizens. Yet today, the Trudeau Liberals are willing to do little 
beyond rhetoric to fight for Trans Mountain in the face of vociferous 
opposition in B.C., hurting the 51 First Nations that have signed off in
 support of the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's in all 
Albertans'interest to see this pipeline succeed. We in the United 
Conservative Party welcome the government's recent about face. After 
months mocking our suggestions to threaten the B.C. NDP with serious 
consequences, including potentially cutting off <b>oil</b> shipments and tolling B.C. natural gas, the premier has finally accepted our advice, albeit far too late.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We welcome a robust, 
serious debate on what's needed to get this pipeline built. But we 
should not be deluded into the fantasy that punitive taxes on everyday 
Albertans will appease the fringe yet extremely vocal anti-pipeline 
minority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, we must make it 
clear to the vast majority of reasonable Canadians that the success of 
our energy sector is critical for the success of our country, and that 
Alberta cannot be taken for granted any longer. Prasad Panda is the 
United Conservative MLA for Calgary-Foothills.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier Rachel Notley recently laid out her government's plan for the near term via the government's recent throne speech.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are three things that taxpayers should note.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First,
 it's positive to see Premier Notley continues to publicly push for the 
Trans Mountain pipeline project - an initiative that will pay a fortune 
in taxes to the Alberta government and create jobs and opportunities for
 our province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's important that the 
premier has spoken out and has seemingly muzzled radical 
environmentalists in her own party on the issue - such as her education 
minister who previously led a chant at a protest at the legislature 
against the <b>oil</b> sands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, what should also be clear by now is that Premier Notley's carbon tax hasn't earned our province the "<b>social licence</b>" we were promised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The premier is shutting 
down coal power plants, Albertans have paid a fortune in carbon taxes 
and other new costly environmental regulations have been layered on our 
economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite all those moves, radical environmentalists in B.C. are still protesting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only have we lost 
jobs because of these policies, the government's own numbers suggest our
 province still won't meet climate change targets in the Paris Accord.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what's the point? 
Clearly, it's time to scrap the carbon tax and pursue a new, 
taxpayer-friendly approach. For example, let's refocus on getting 
Canada's natural gas over to China so that we can offset some of their 
coal power plants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second point 
Albertans should be mindful about is the section in the throne speech 
that boasts about reducing "hospitality and travel costs" and providing 
"no raises" for teachers and nurses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's true the government reduced travel and hospitality costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our calculations - based 
on an enormous spreadsheet released by the government - shows a $4 
million reduction in travel and hospitality expenses over the past four 
@colincraig1 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a great step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the grand scheme of the province's $56-billion budget, it's not a lot of money, but it's a good case of leading by example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for "no raises" for teachers and nurses - that's just not true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Calgary and Edmonton school boards indicated in letters to the <span class="companylink">Canadian Taxpayers Federation</span> that a combined 6,842 teachers in their divisions are receiving a pay increase this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thousands of other teachers across the province will also receive a pay increase due to the way the contract was negotiated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many teachers in Alberta 
will still receive a true freeze, but for the government to suggest that
 all teachers are receiving a freeze is simply not true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, the government's
 news release about the throne speech notes, "work will continue with 
the public sector to reduce costs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the government has 
trimmed some spending, taxpayers should know that overall spending has 
increased every year since the NDP were elected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the government is currently on pace to spend about $1 billion more this year than they originally budgeted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debt is still expected to more than triple during Premier Notley's four years in office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that's the big 
picture problem with the Alberta government's approach - some tinkering 
around the edges, but not enough in terms of bold action to get the 
province's spending under control and get our province back on the right
 track.</p>

supportive grunt, certainly doesn't seem inclined to do much more than

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley has understandably
 had enough. Now she says Alberta won't increase its carbon tax to $50

 to the federal government's pan-Canadian framework with the approval of
 the Trans Mountain pipeline," she said in the legislature this week. 
"Now, obviously, approval means nothing if it's not constructed ... we 
will not move forward ... until we see that construction is fully

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney has called the 
carbon tax an unfair burden on Alberta residents, with little benefit to
 reaching greenhouse gas emission targets or to getting <b>oil</b> pipelines built. He has promised to kill the tax if he becomes premier in the 2019 election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The levy was imposed by 
Notley in 2017 on heating and gasoline to fund green projects ranging 
from solar panels to multibillion-dollar transit projects and programs 
to phase out coalfired electricity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province is taking in
 about $1 billion this fiscal year from the levy, but is returning some 
of that through rebates to middle and low-income families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The UCP contends the carbon tax has failed in its main objective to buy "<b>social licence</b>"
 and give Alberta some moral high ground against pipeline opponents by 
demonstrating it is committed to balancing resource development with 
environmental stewardship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government house leader 
Brian Mason, responding to Kenney's bill, said the tax is succeeding, 
and led to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government approving the 
Trans Mountain pipeline expansion from Edmonton to Burnaby in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It [the tax and climate 
plan] is probably our best tool to keep the federal government's nose to
 the grindstone when it comes to seeing through the decision to build 
the Trans Mountain pipeline, and Mr. Kenney would strike it from our 
hands," said Mason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta is losing millions of dollars a day because its heavy <b>oil</b> is discounted due to pipeline bottlenecks and lack of access to customers in overseas markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trans Mountain line 
would triple the crude going west from Alberta, but the project is 
opposed by the British Columbia government and has been tied up in 
permit delays, court challenges and political roadblocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley banned wine from 
B.C. for two weeks in February in protest. Last week she announced she 
will get legislation passed giving her the option to cut <b>oil</b> 
exports to B.C. and grant power to take punitive action on natural gas 
shipments that travel from B.C. through Alberta to the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She has also urged 
Trudeau's government to step up in the fight, given that 
inter-provincial pipelines are federal responsibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley reiterated 
Thursday that her government has tied its compliance with Trudeau's 
federal climate plan, and the looming federal tax on carbon, to the 
success of the Trans Mountain line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The issue around 
additional levies is definitely linked to the pipeline, and our 
government - as I've said before - will not move forward until we get 
the pipeline."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal climate plan 
would tax greenhouse gas emissions starting at $10 per tonne this year, 
rising $10 a year to $50 a tonne in 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta taxes greenhouse 
gases at $30 a tonne, and Kenney has been pushing Notley on whether she 
will challenge Ottawa if it tries to impose a tax above the province's 
current rate.</p>

 latest proof is in, although the facts have been obvious for many 
years. Foreigners are financing and organizing opposition in Canada to 
natural resource development, part of an anti-fossil-fuel campaign that 
is costing our economy an estimated $15 billion this year, due to lack 
of access to international markets, and much more in lost capital 
investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the most recent 
little gem will finally get the chattering class to acknowledge reality:
 A leaked U.S. document preparing mass-action protests against <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s
 Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project. It sets out goals and 
operating principles for a clandestine organization designed to drive 
political resistance under the guise of an independent rank-and-file 
protest movement.</p>

 a California-based NGO "building a global grassroots climate movement."
 Using insect analogies (theirs, not mine) the "Hive" contributes money,
 action and organizational experience and technical know-how, while a 
"Swarm" will generate mass action. Fenton is explicit about its "Purpose
 &amp; Shared Goals: This group is coming together to support mass 
popular resistance to construction of the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not the only U.S. organization devoted to blocking development of Canada's <b>oil</b>
 and gas reserves that, incidentally, would compete with America's own 
resources. Vivian Krause, a Vancouver-based researcher and writer, has 
documented the money funnelled through Tides Foundation, New Venture 
Fund and the Oak Foundation to impede Canadian hydrocarbon growth, 
especially the <b>oil</b> sands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These organizations are 
bolstered by a coterie of narcissistic celebrities whose vacuous 
certainty is outdone by their ignorance of science and economics and 
their extravagant carbon-intensive lifestyles.? All this brings to mind 
when, as minister of natural resources, I wrote an open letter labelling
 certain environmental groups as "radicals," financed in part by 
non-Canadian donors. The derisive outcry was deafening from media, 
opposition parties, ENGOs and even a few timorous senior executives in 
the <b>oil</b> and gas business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I defined radical as 
opposition to every major resource project. Moreover, I issued a 
challenge to any environmental organization to name a single pipeline 
project that it supported. The silence was deafening. Possibly because 
my definition sounded too reasonable, the media never reported on my 
explanation of the definition or the challenge, which I reiterated 
numerous times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What I said was factual 
then and has been conclusively proven to be true over the past six 
years. Trying to shut down fossil-fuel development is not viewed as 
radical to many environmentalists, even though the economic consequences
 would be disastrous. Or perhaps it was impolite in Canada to use the 
"r" word. It was obviously politically incorrect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Irrespective of 
terminology, we have undoubtedly reached a crisis resulting from 
unrelenting opposition to pipeline construction, abetted by foreign 
funding and a federal government obsessed with green ideology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is telling that 
opponents are unimpressed by governments' efforts to reduce greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions. They understand that Canada cannot make a 
meaningful difference to international emissions, since our output 
represents only 1.6 per cent of the global total. Their focus is on the <b>oil</b> sands, which they claim can measurably add to the global supply of <b>oil</b>, so keeping fossil fuels in the ground is their goal. The fact the <b>oil</b> sands only represent a minuscule one-thousandth of global emissions makes it the wrong target. But symbolism is everything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Militants are indifferent
 to the terrible damage they are inflicting on our economy, First 
Nations and the poor, all without any measurable impact on global 
warming. Further, they assert that Canada has a moral responsibility to 
make costly but ineffective sacrifices, even though other countries are 
not doing their share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The B.C. government's 
campaign against the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion proves there is 
no point in succumbing to extortionate demands or making costly 
concessions to achieve an elusive <b>social licence</b>. The goal posts 
keep moving. By now, that must be evident even to Alberta Premier Rachel
 Notley and federal Natural Resource Minister Jim Carr, though they will
 never admit it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At what point might <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 headquarters in Houston cancel the project in frustration with its 
mounting financial and reputational risk? That would landlock Canada's 
energy for a very long time, a disastrous result, which is the goal of 
opponents. It is time for Parliament to declare the pipeline a work "for
 the general advantage of Canada," thereby removing most dilatory 
tactics (but not social resistance). Prime Minister Justin Trudeau 
should also tell foreign agitators to butt out of Canadian affairs.</p>

 talking to a sold-out lunchtime business crowd in Calgary who laughed 
at his jokes, applauded his zingers and gave him a genuine standing 
ovation, Wall doesn't miss a beat with the media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And when you ask about that damn carbon tax, you know the fire will be hot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall mentions <b>social licence</b>. It's the idea people such as Premier Notley have been flogging. Pay a carbon tax, get a pipeline built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Alberta is fighting with B.C. to get a pipeline built and even Notley threatens this province may have to pull out all the</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Brad stops to make it happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're going to punish ourselves because we've got <b>oil</b> and gas and that's going to change the minds of people who don't like <b>oil</b> and gas. I just disagreed from the beginning," says Wall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If someone doesn't like the <b>oil</b> and gas sector the fact you implement a carbon tax is not going to change that person's opinion."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his speech to the suits, Wall is direct. He's serving the red meat on this lunch menu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The New Left, no matter what they say, they're not real comfortable with what you do," he tells the crowd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall says what he calls the New Left are the likes of today's NDP and the Trudeau version of the Liberals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall remembers when the 
NDP on the prairies were more practical sorts. Those who didn't like the
 oilpatch were on the fringes of the party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The fringes are running prairie New Democrat, prairie left-wing organizations now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's Notley's comment about Alberta being the "embarrassing cousin" because of its record on the environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't know how you ever walk that back," says Wall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He goes after the Notley NDP again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Somebody in a senior level of a government, a minister or a chief of staff telling people not to eat beef in Alberta."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NDP environment minister Shannon Phillips said the tweet on her account advising us to eat less meat was from a staffer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dippers aren't the only target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's Trudeau and his 
comment in Ontario about "phasing out the oilsands." Days later, when 
asked about it in Calgary by your scribbler, the PM said he "misspoke."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall mentions the three big elections coming up. Ontario, Alberta and the federal battle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think we're going to find out if fiscal responsibility is cool again. Because most decidedly it is not cool right now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The former Saskatchewan 
leader says the '80s saw the drunken-sailor spending and in the '90s the
 chicken came home to roost and there was pain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall figures we might have "collective amnesia" about what went on back then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"How could we have 
forgotten the importance of fiscal responsibility?" Wall says the Notley
 NDP are being "shortsighted" with their spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few days back, Notley makes the crack about United Conservative leader Jason Kenney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Jason, the 1990s are calling and they want their ridiculous ideas back," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall fires back. "I think
 the '90s are calling: Have we forgotten?" says Wall, hoping for a 
return to "some sort of reasonable fiscal plan that isn't based on 
rainbows and unicorns."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall also doesn't like how people have surrendered the word "progressive" to the leftists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What is progressive 
about pursuing policies that don't put the economy first, that don't put
 a priority on making sure people are working? What's progressive about 
long-term deficits that are actually going to visit great pain on those 
who are most vulnerable?" Wall wouldn't be Wall if he didn't give an 
elbow to Quebec. On equalization, of course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Folks, I'm going to say this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'd go to 
premiers'meetings and there'd always be these forces that would say: No,
 don't do anything that would upset la belle province."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a $19-billion 
federal program and $11.3 billion of it goes to a 400-year old economy 
in the second-most populous province in the country. There's an issue 
there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, for the record, Wall is 100% behind turning off the taps on <b>oil</b> to B.C. as a last resort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Alberta, you got to do this," says Wall, again pointing out the province should only do it if all else fails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As a has-been premier I'll be cheering from the sidelines."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall knows he may be seen as meddling in Alberta politics. After all, he's from Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My province is stronger when Alberta is stronger. My country is stronger when Alberta is stronger."</p>

 — Alberta Premier Rachel Notley and Opposition Leader Jason Kenney 
exchanged smiles and brief waves in the Alberta legislature Monday 
before letting the accusations fly in their first question period 
together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney accused Notley of 
misleading Albertans on her carbon tax while the premier said Kenney and
 other Conservatives let down all of Canada by failing to get a pipeline
 built to tidewater while in power in Ottawa.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We
 had Conservatives in Ottawa, we had Conservatives in Edmonton (in the 
provincial government) and we had Conservatives in Victoria and they 
couldn't get a pipeline built," Notley told the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They had their chance and they blew it. That won't happen again."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney attacked Notley 
over the multibillion-dollar carbon tax. He noted Notley didn't campaign
 on it in the 2015 election. And he questioned its value as a good faith
 "<b>social licence</b>" gesture given that the Trans Mountain pipeline 
expansion to B.C., approved by Ottawa, is still facing delays from the 
B.C. government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"(Notley) told Albertans 
if we just pay more for everything somehow magically pipeline opponents 
would become pipeline supporters and pipelines would get built," said 
Kenney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As per the noisy, raucous
 parliamentary tradition, Notley's answers were met with cheers and desk
 thumping from her caucus members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney's questions and comments, however, were met with silence from his team and there was no cross-aisle heckling of Notley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney later told reporters that's how he wants it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think people who tune 
in actually want to be able to hear their legislators and what they are 
saying. Just endless, pointless background noise inhibits that," he 
said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My observation as a 
regular Albertan watching this assembly (before) was I couldn't hear 
half of what they were saying with all the thumping going on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney and the UCP caucus
 members focused on the carbon tax during question period. Kenney said 
it will be the theme during the spring sitting and up to the next 
election in the spring of 2019, and has promised to scrap the tax if he 
becomes premier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley said the tax 
helped build the moral foundation for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's 
decision to green light the Trans Mountain expansion in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley has been locked in
 a battle with B.C. Premier John Horgan's government over what Alberta 
terms delay tactics on the pipeline, including court challenges in an 
area that Notley says is clearly an area of federal responsibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Notley announced Alberta will consider curtailing the flow of <b>oil</b> if B.C. continues its tactics, an idea that Kenney had been touting for weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After question period, 
all sides debated a government motion to urge Ottawa take action to get 
Trans Mountain approved and to support the province in its effort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At every step along the 
way, our government has made the case to Canadians (for energy 
development and pipelines)," Notley told the house after introducing the
 motion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney has promised to elevate the decorum from his caucus the house, hence the impromptu cross-aisle wave to the premier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I intended to actually 
go over and shake her hand but then all of my guys started shouting at 
me," said Kenney. "Apparently you can't cross the floor, metaphorically 
speaking, here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I just wanted to salute 
her. At the end of the day we're going to disagree on a lot of things, 
agree on some, but we don't have to be nasty about it."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTERRE REPORTS YEAR-END RESERVES AND RESOURCES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questerre Energy Corp</span>. has released the results of its Dec. 31, 2017, reserves assessment and evaluation of its <b>oil</b> and natural gas properties, as evaluated by <span class="companylink">McDaniel &amp; Associates Consultants Ltd</span>. with an effective date of Dec. 31, 2017, prepared in accordance with the standards contained in the Canadian <b>oil</b> and gas evaluation handbook and National Instrument 51-101 -- Standards of Disclosure for <b>Oil</b> and Gas Activities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, president and chief executive officer, commented: "Our 
reserve growth reflects the active drilling program at Kakwa this year 
and the light <b>oil</b> acquisition at Antler. Corporate proved and probable reserves gross reserves grew by 20 per cent or 3.22 million barrels of <b>oil</b>
 equivalent from 15.7 mmboe to 18.41 mmboe, net of production during the
 year. The before-tax NPV10 [net present value at a 10-per-cent 
discount] estimated for the corporate proved and probable reserves using
 McDaniel's year-end price forecast is $174.7-million."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commenting on Questerre's
 Utica resources in Quebec, he added: "The reserve engineers updated our
 resource report from last year for their current price forecast. The 
best estimate of risked contingent resources net to Questerre for the 
Becancour and Lotbiniere project areas is unchanged at 214 billion cubic
 feet. These project areas as assessed only cover 5 per cent of our 
total acreage. The risked net present value discounted at 10 per cent 
before tax for this limited development area is $301-million compared to
 $311-million last year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credit facility</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company also reported
 on the status of its credit facility review that was conducted in the 
fourth quarter of 2017. The lender has advised that the primary credit 
facility will be renewed at $18-million. The facility will include a 
$17.9-million revolving operating demand facility. Credit facility A can
 be used for general corporate purposes, continuing operations and 
capital expenditures within Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dec. 31, 2017, reserve information</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In accordance with the 
requirements of NI 51-101, the company anticipates filing its annual 
information form that includes more detailed disclosure relating to 
petroleum and natural gas activities for the 2017 fiscal year, in the 
form of Form 51-101F1, at the end of March, 2018, as set out in the 
report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The associated tables set forth contain certain information relating to the <b>oil</b>
 and natural gas reserves of the company's properties and the present 
value of the estimated future net cash flow associated with such 
reserves as at Dec. 31, 2017, which numbers may vary slightly from those
 presented in the report due to rounding. Also, due to rounding, certain

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dec. 31, 2017, Quebec resource information</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questerre also reported on the year-end update prepared by <span class="companylink">GLJ Petroleum Consultants Ltd</span>.
 to the independent resource assessment of its 735,910 gross (190,800 
net) acres in the St. Lawrence lowlands, Quebec, that have potential for
 the Upper Utica shale effective Dec. 31, 2017, in a report dated March 
5, 2018. The GLJ resource assessment was prepared in accordance with NI 
51-101 and the standards contained in the COGE handbook. The GLJ 
resource assessment did not include any of the corporation's other 
properties. All anticipated results disclosed herein were prepared by 
GLJ, which is an independent qualified reserves evaluator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GLJ used probabilistic 
methods to generate low, best and high estimates of total petroleum 
initially in place (TPIIP), both discovered and undiscovered. 
Recoverable contingent and prospective resources over Questerre's 
acreage were estimated by analogy and based on available well data over 
the Quebec Utica and public data from U.S. Utica and Marcellus shale 
plays. The evaluation consisted of the Upper Utica which includes the 
Indian Castle and Dolgeville members as well as the Flat Creek. The Flat
 Creek, the lowermost member, was only evaluated to estimate 
undiscovered petroleum initially in place (UPIIP). No recoverable 
resources were assigned to the Flat Creek given the lack of test data 
showing established technology can support commercial development at 
this time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GLJ resource 
assessment is based on the results from several vertical and horizontal 
wells on the Questerre's acreage that have all encountered pay in the 
Utica. Test data from these wells in conjunction with offset development
 and studies of the analogous U.S. Utica support the prospective 
commercial development of these resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Significant positive 
factors relevant to the estimate of Questerre's resources include the 
importation of all natural gas consumed in Quebec creating demand for 
local production, premium realized pricing due to the transportation 
costs associated with importing natural gas for consumption, production 
test data from Questerre's existing wells and the development of the 
analogous Utica shale in the United States. Significant negative factors
 include the limited number of wells on Questerre's acreage, lack of a 
developed service sector providing uncertainty regarding estimates of 
capital and operating costs, developing hydrocarbon regulations and 
environmental legislation and the requirement to obtain social 
acceptability for <b>oil</b> and gas operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Questerre believes 
it will have sufficient financial capability to finance its share of 
costs associated with the development program in the GLJ resource 
assessment, it may not have access to the necessary capital when 
required. Conducting the development program is also dependent on the 
participation by Questerre's joint venture partners. There is no 
guarantee that they will elect to participate in the program to the 
extent required. Questerre retains the right to conduct activities 
without the operators' participation on an independent operations basis 
whereby it can finance 100 per cent of the capital costs for certain 
well operations and facilities in return for net revenue equal to 400 
per cent of its capital investment before the operators can elect to 
either remain in a penalty position or hold a working interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent resources</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The TPIIP was determined 
probabilistically on a permit basis with estimates of 45 billion to 145 
billion cubic feet per square mile for the Upper Utica. This compares 
favourably with analogous U.S. shale plays with estimates of the Utica 
in Ohio at between 35 billion and 85 billion cubic feet per square mile 
and 25 billion to 150 billion cubic feet per square mile for the 
Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania. Of the TPIIP estimated over Questerre's
 acreage, only land within a three-mile radius of a successfully tested 
well was quantified as discovered gas in place. Based on this 
qualification only 16 per cent of the total mapped TPIIP in the Upper 
Utica was considered discovered contingent resource.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Upper Utica was 
considered undiscovered for approximately 84 per cent of the total 
mapped TPIIP. Recovery factors of 18 per cent, 26 per cent and 37 per 
cent were applied to the low, best and high estimates resource cases, 
respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Summary information 
regarding contingent resources and net present value of future net 
revenues from contingent resources is set forth below and is derived, in
 each case, from the GLJ resource assessment. All contingent resources 
evaluated in the GLJ resource assessment were deemed economic at the 
effective date of Dec. 31, 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questerre's average 
working interest in its gross best estimate contingent resources is 25.9
 per cent. In addition to Questerre's working interest, the company also
 holds a royalty interest in the acreage and associated resources. As a 
result, in some cases Questerre's net volumes (after royalties) exceed 
its working interest volumes. For clarity, included in the associated 
tables are Questerre's volume before royalties, gross working interest 
volumes and net volumes after royalties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A range of contingent resources estimates (low, best and high) was prepared by GLJ.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GLJ resources 
assessment estimated gross risked contingent resources with a project 
maturity subclass of development on hold of 18.6 million boe (low 
estimate) to 50 million boe (high estimate), with a best estimate of 
30.4 million boe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GLJ resources 
assessment estimated gross risked contingent resources with a project 
maturity subclass of development unclarified of 8.9 million boe (low 
estimate) to 23.8 million boe (high estimate), with a best estimate of 
14.6 million boe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estimate of risked net
 present value of future net revenue of contingent resources is 
preliminary in nature and is provided to assist the reader in reaching 
an opinion on the merit and likelihood of the company proceeding with 
the required investment. It includes contingent resources that are 
considered too uncertain with respect to the chance of development to be
 classified as reserves. There is uncertainty that the risked net 
present value of future net revenue will be realized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent resources can 
be subclassified based on their project maturity subclass which help 
identify a project's change of commerciality. The project maturity 
subclasses for contingent resources are development pending, development
 on hold, development unclarified or development not viable, all as 
defined in the COGE handbook. Development pending is when resolution of 
the final conditions for development is being actively pursued (high 
chance of development). Development on hold is when there is a 
reasonable chance of development, but there are major non-technical 
contingencies to be resolved that are usually beyond the control of the 
operator. Development unclarified is when the evaluation is incomplete 
and there is continuing activity to resolve any risks or uncertainties. 
Development not viable is when no further data acquisition or evaluation
 is currently planned and hence there is a low chance of development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those areas classified as
 development on hold are primarily contingent on the passage of 
applicable hydrocarbon and environmental legislation and regulations as 
well as local acceptability. Remaining areas classified as development 
unclarified have additional contingency or risk associated with securing
 <b>social licence</b> to operate and are thereby a lower priority for 
development. Additional contingencies include firm development plans, 
detailed cost estimates and corporate approvals and sanctioning. There 
is no certainty that any portion of the contingent resources will be 
economic to develop. Though pilot horizontal development plans have been
 proposed, the project evaluation scenario for the contingent resources 
is not sufficiently defined to make an investment decision to proceed to
 development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent resources are 
evaluated based on the same fiscal conditions used in the assessment of 
reserves, and as such, are forecasted to be economic. Contingent 
resource values are estimated on the basis of established technology, 
namely multistage hydraulic fracturing recovery technologies that are 
widely used in the development of shale gas plays including in the 
Montney in Canada and the Utica formation in Ohio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chance of 
commerciality for contingent resources is equal to the product of the 
chance of discovery and the chance of development. Chance of discovery 
is the estimated probability that exploration activities will confirm 
the existence of a significant accumulation of potentially recoverable 
petroleum. Chance of development is the estimated probability that, once
 discovered, a known accumulation will be commercially developed. Based 
on contingencies related to the passage of applicable hydrocarbon and 
environmental legislation, regulations, local acceptability, and 
additional risk associated with securing <b>social licence</b> to 
operate, firm development plans, detailed cost estimates and corporate 
approvals GLJ estimated the chance of development for the development 
unclarified subclass ranges between 10 per cent and 25 per cent as 
detailed in the associated table. By definition the chance of discovery 
for contingent resource is 100 per cent. The corresponding chance of 
commerciality for the development unclarified subclass is therefore 
estimated at between 10 per cent and 25 per cent as detailed in the 
associated table.</p>

Notes:
(1) Contingent resources are defined in the COGE handbook as those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given 
date, to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established technology or technology under 
development, but which are not currently considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more contingencies.
There is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the contingent resources or that
Questerre will produce any portion of the volumes currently classified as contingent resources. The estimates of 
contingent resources involve implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the resources 
described exists in the quantities predicted or estimated, as at a given date, and that the resources can be 
profitably produced in the future. The risked net present value of the future net revenue from the contingent 
resources does not represent the fair market value of the contingent resources. Actual contingent resources (and 
any volumes that may be reclassified as reserves) and future production therefrom may be greater than or less 
than the estimates provided herein.
(2) GLJ prepared the estimates of contingent resources shown for each property using deterministic principles and 
methods. Probabilistic aggregation of the low and high property estimates shown in the table might produce 
different total volumes than the arithmetic sums shown in the table.
(3) Gross contingent resources are Questerre's working interest (operating or non-operating) share before 
deduction of royalties and without including any royalty interests of Questerre. Net contingent resources are 
Questerre's working interest (operating or non-operating) share after deduction of royalty obligations, plus 
Questerre's royalty interests in contingent resources.
(4) The risked net present value of future net revenue attributable to the contingent resources does not represent 
the fair market value of the contingent resources. Estimated abandonment and reclamation costs have been included 
in the evaluation.
(5) Low estimate contingent resources are considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the low estimate. 
If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 90-per-cent probability (P90) that the quantities 
actually recovered will equal or exceed the low estimate.
(6) Best estimate contingent resources are considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will actually 
be recovered. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than 
the best estimate. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50-per-cent probability (P50) 
that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the best estimate.
(7) High estimate contingent resources are considered to be an optimistic estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the high 
estimate. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 10-per-cent probability (P10) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the high estimate.
(8) The chance of development (CoDev) is the estimated probability that, once discovered, a known accumulation 
will be commercially developed. Five factors have been considered in determining the CoDev as follows:
CoDev equals Ps (economic factor) times Ps (technology factor) times Ps (development plan factor)  times Ps 
(development time frame factor) times Ps (other contingency factor) wherein Ps is the probability of success.
Economic factor -- For reserves to be assessed, a project must be economic. With respect to contingent 
resources, this factor captures uncertainty in the assessment of economic status principally due to uncertainty 
in cost estimates and marketing options. Economic viability uncertainty due to technology is more aptly captured 
with the technology factor. The economic factor will be one for reserves and will often be one for development 
pending projects and for projects with a development study or predevelopment study with a robust rate of 
return. A robust rate of return means that the project retains economic status with variation in costs and/or 
marketing plans over the expected range of outcomes for these variables.
Technology factor -- For reserves to be assessed, a project must utilize established technology. With respect to 
contingent resources, this factor captures the uncertainty in the viability of the proposed technology for 
the subject reservoir, namely, the uncertainty associated with technology under development. By definition, 
technology under development is a recovery process or process improvement that has been determined to be 
technically viable via field test and is being field tested further to determine its economic viability in the 
subject reservoir. The technology factor will be one for reserves and for established technology. For technology 
under development, this factor will consider different risks associated with technologies being developed at 
the scale of the well versus the scale of a project and technologies which are being modified or extended for 
the subject reservoir versus new emerging technologies which have not previously been applied in any 
commercial application. The risk assessment will also consider the quality and sufficiency of the test data 
available, the ability to reliably scale such data and the ability to extrapolate results in time.
Development plan factor -- For reserves to be assessed, a project must have a detailed development plan. 
With respect to contingent resources, this factor captures the uncertainty in the project evaluation 
scenario. The development plan factor will be one for reserves and high, approaching one, for development 
pending projects. This factor will consider development plan detail variations including the degree of 
delineation, reservoir specific development and operating strategy detail (technology decision, well 
layouts (spacing and pad locations), completion strategy, start-up strategy, water source and disposal, other 
infrastructure, facility design, marketing plans) and the quality of the cost estimates as provided by the 
developer.
Development time frame factor -- In the case of major projects, for reserves to be assessed, first major capital 
spending must be initiated within five years of the effective date. The development time frame factor will be 
one for reserves and will often be one for development pending projects provided the project is planned 
on stream based on the same criteria used in the assessment of reserves. With respect to contingent resources, 
the factor will approach one for projects planned on stream with a time frame slightly longer than the 
limiting reserves criteria.
Other contingency factor -- For reserves to be assessed, all contingencies must be eliminated. With respect 
to contingent resources, this factor captures major contingencies, usually beyond the control of the operator, 
other than those captured by economic status, technology status, project evaluation scenario status and the 
development time frame. The other contingency factor will be one for reserves and for development pending 
projects and less than one for on hold. Provided all contingencies have been identified and their resolution 
is reasonably certain, this factor would also be one for development unclarified projects.
These factors may be interrelated (dependent) and care has been taken to ensure that risks are appropriately 
accounted.
(1) Contingent resources for the lowlands have been estimated based the results from several vertical and 
horizontal wells on the company's acreage that have all encountered pay in the Utica. Test data from these wells 
in conjunction with offset development and studies of analogous U.S. Utica support the prospective commercial 
development on these resources. The estimated unrisked cost to bring these contingent resources on commercial 
production is $809.28-million and the expected timeline is between two and 11 years. The specific contingencies 
for these resources are the passage of applicable hydrocarbon and environmental legislation, regulations, local 
acceptability, firm development plans, detailed cost estimates and corporate approvals and sanctioning.
(2) In Canada, GLJ has estimated a company gross aggregate of risked on hold best estimate contingent resources 
of 30.42 million boe for the projects outlined. Utilizing established recovery technology, the risked estimated 
cost to bring these resources on commercial production is an aggregate of $168-million with an expected 
timeline of two to four years.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Summary information 
regarding prospective resources and net present value of future net 
revenues from prospective resources are set forth and are derived, in 
each case, from the GLJ resources assessment. The GLJ resources 
assessment was prepared in accordance with COGE handbook and NI 51-101 
by GLJ, an independent qualified reserve evaluator. All prospective

 at the effective date of Dec. 31, 2017. Prospective resources are in

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Upper Utica was 
considered undiscovered for approximately 84 per cent of the total

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A range of prospective resources estimates (low, best and high) were prepared by GLJ.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GLJ resources

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chance of 
commerciality for prospective resources is equal to the product of the 
chance of discovery and the chance of development. Chance of discovery 
is the estimated probability that exploration activities will confirm 
the existence of a significant accumulation of potentially recoverable 
petroleum. Chance of development is the estimated probability that, once
 discovered, a known accumulation will be commercially developed. Based 
on contingencies related to the passage of applicable hydrocarbon and 
environmental legislation, regulations, local acceptability, and 
additional risk associated with securing <b>social licence</b> to 
operate, firm development plans, detailed cost estimates and corporate 
approvals GLJ estimated the chance of development at 19 per cent. 
Proximity to extensional and compressional-related fault systems 
presents risk of structuring resulting in leak off and reduced pressures
 in some prospective regions, additionally, lack of delineation data 
provides reservoir risk associated with uncertainty regarding reservoir 
quality and rock mechanics amicable to hydraulic fracturing. Therefore, 
GLJ has estimated the chance of discovery at 81 per cent. The 
corresponding chance of commerciality is 15 per cent. This also takes 
into account Questerre's working interest and operatorship of its assets

Notes 
Prospective resources are defined in the COGE handbook as those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, 
to be potentially recoverable from unknown accumulations by application of future development projects. Prospective 
resources have both an associated chance of discovery (CoDis) and a chance of development (CoDev). There is no 
certainty that any portion of the prospective resources will be discovered. If discovered, there is no certainty that 
it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the prospective resources or that Questerre will produce any 
portion of the volumes currently classified as prospective resources. The estimates of prospective resources involve 
implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the resources described exist in the quantities 
predicted or estimated, as at a given date, and that the resources can be profitably produced in the future. The 
risked net present value of the future net revenue from the prospective resources does not represent the fair market 
value of the prospective resources. Actual prospective resources (and any volumes that may be reclassified as 
reserves) and future production therefrom may be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein.
GLJ prepared the estimates of prospective resources shown for each property using deterministic principles and methods. 
Probabilistic aggregation of the low and high property estimates shown in the table might produce different total 
volumes than the arithmetic sums shown in the table.
The forecast price and cost assumptions utilized in the year-end 2017 reserves report were also utilized by GLJ in 
preparing the GLJ resource assessment.
Gross prospective resources are Questerre's working interest (operating or non-operating) share before deduction of 
royalties and without including any royalty interests of the company. Net prospective resources are Questerre's 
working interest (operating or non-operating) share after deduction of royalty obligations, plus Questerre's royalty 
interests in prospective resources.
The risked net present value of future net revenue attributable to the prospective resources does not represent the 
fair market value of the prospective resources. Estimated abandonment and reclamation costs have been included in 
the evaluation.
The low estimate prospective resources are considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity that will actually 
be recovered. It is likely that the actual net remaining quantities recovered will exceed the low estimate of 87 
million boe. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 90-per-cent probability (P90) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the low estimate.  
The best estimate prospective resources are considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will actually be 
recovered. It is equally likely that the actual net remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the 
best estimate of 143 million. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50-per-cent probability

estimate of 238 million boe. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 10-per-cent probability 
(P10) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the high estimate.
The chance of commerciality is defined as the product of the chance of discovery and the chance of development. 
Chance of discovery is defined in COGE handbook as the estimated probability that exploration activities will 
confirm the existence of a significant accumulation of potentially recoverable petroleum. Chance of development is 
defined as the estimated probability that, once discovered, a known accumulation will be commercially developed.

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, we learned from Scotiabank that lack of export pipeline capacity and the resulting discount on Canadian <b>oil</b>
 will cost the Canadian economy $15.6 billion a year, or nearly $43 
million a day. That loss affects provincial and federal revenues as much
 as corporate income. We are all losing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also last month came the 
unveiling of the Trudeau government's new suite of policies for 
reviewing and approving major energy infrastructure projects, such as <b>oil</b> and gas pipelines.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So
 is there anything in the new rules that will address our 
$43-million-a-day leak to our Southern neighbour? Unfortunately, the 
answer appears to be no. The new process appears to further increase 
uncertainty for future pipeline proponents and investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the symbolic level, the messaging is problematic. When you replace an agency named the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board (NEB) </span>with
 a new agency named the Impact Assessment Agency (IAA), the message is 
clear: environmental impact is replacing economic benefit as Canada's 
primary policy focus when it comes to new energy projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The details are equally 
discouraging. The proposed changes broaden the number of criteria that a
 new pipeline must meet. These now include not just climate change and 
enhanced Aboriginal consultation, but also "the intersection of sex and 
gender with other identity factors." For a pipeline?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public access to panel 
hearings is also increased. Gone is the old rule that limited 
participation to individuals and groups "directly affected" by a 
proposed pipeline. Now anyone interested must be allowed to participate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This open-door policy 
will increase the opportunity for climate change activists - many of 
them heavily funded by American interests - to clog the hearing process 
with project-killing delays. These groups don't want better, safer 
pipelines. They want zero pipelines. And they know that if they cannot 
kill new pipeline projects directly, they can delay them to death with 
endless hearings, rule changes, consultations, environmental studies, 
and court challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were able to do this
 under the old rules, as the obituaries for Northern Gateway and Energy 
East attest. And they will certainly try to do it again under the new 
rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What explains this 
disappointing result? At one level, it is another example of the prime 
minister trying to have it both ways on climate change and energy 
development. He wants to go into next year's federal election with the 
message that he has struck a statesmanlike "balance" between these 
competing objectives. But implicit in this argument is the assumption - 
or more accurately, the delusion - that green virtue signals like carbon
 taxes and expensive renewables are going to buy "<b>social licence</b>" for the development and export of Canada's valuable <b>oil</b> and gas reserves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's high time to stop 
indulging that charade. We now have example after example of climate 
change activists declaring publicly that nothing Canada does to reduce 
our domestic CO2 emissions will change their resolute opposition to new 
export pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was shockingly clear in an interview that CBC's Power and Politics did with the American anti-<b>oil</b> activist Bill McKibbon the evening that Nebraska approved a routing for <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s Keystone XL pipeline. McKibbon is the founder of <span class="companylink">350.org</span>, one of largest and best funded climate change interest groups in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every Canadian should see
 thisinterview( 
http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1100225603963[http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1100225603963]
 ) for themselves, but here is a summary of the key exchanges:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interviewer: What common ground might you be able to find with the Alberta government?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McKibbon: At this point, a
 common ground can't be found... The only thing we can do is keep as 
much carbon in the ground as possible... Canada, a rich country, needs 
to keep that carbon safely underground...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interviewer: So you don't give this government any credit (for its climate change policies)?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McKibbon: Oh, I think 
they are doing a good job on the demand side... but there aren't enough 
Canadians for that to be a very big deal. The big deal is the huge pool 
of carbon that sits underneath Alberta, and that will dwarf whatever it 
is that Canada does with its own domestic emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not just the 
McKibbons of the world that are stating the obvious fact that, at two 
per cent of global emissions, what Canada does to reduce our domestic 
emissions is irrelevant to what happens globally. We are too small to 
matter. Our own homegrown McKibbon - David Suzuki - bluntly said the 
same thing recently. Delivering a speech at a Calgary's teachers 
convention, Suzuki declared: "I'm sorry Alberta, but we have to keep 
that fuel in the ground... The tar sands have to be shut down... No more
 infrastructure getting that stuff out - that means rails, pipelines, 
shipping. There's no point in investing in infrastructure when they're 
all going to be shut down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So much for <b>social licence</b>.
 As for the new Impact Assessment Agency, it's not likely to be very 
busy anyhow. Unless it is substantially amended to correct the problems 
identified above, it seems doubtful that any investors will be proposing
 a new pipeline in Canada. And don't act surprised when you learn that <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> - Canada's oldest and largest pipeline company - is already investigating moving its head office to Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And as for the $43 
million a day that we are losing, there's no end in sight. Some have 
compared our current dilemma to the National Energy Program, but at 
least then, Central Canadians benefited from the loss suffered by 
Western Canadians. This time, the Trudeau Liberals are giving $15.6 
billion a year to American consumers just to win the next election. No 
one in Canada benefits from NEP 2. We are all losing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Michael Binnion reports</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTERRE TO DEVELOP KAKWA NORTH ACREAGE WITH PARTNER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questerre Energy Corp</span>. has entered into an agreement with an experienced operator to develop its 100-per-cent-owned acreage in the Kakwa area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, president and chief executive officer of Questerre, 
commented: "The first well at Kakwa North should spud next quarter, 
subject to rig availability. Given the strong condensate production and 
low sour content from nearby wells on our joint venture acreage we are 
looking forward to the results."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He further added: "With 
this joint venture we are developing our operated acreage and preserving
 capital primarily for Quebec. We are working on our Quebec clean gas 
pilot as we wait for the release of the final regulations later this 
spring."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The farm-in partner is an
 exploration and production company with extensive operating experience 
with the Montney formation in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subject to the terms of 
the agreement, the farm-in partner has the right to drill, complete, 
equip and tie in two horizontal wells targeting the Montney formation to
 earn a 50-per-cent interest in certain acreage held by Questerre at 
Kakwa North. The partner has the option to drill, complete, equip and 
tie in additional wells to earn a similar interest in other acreage held
 by Questerre at Kakwa North and Kakwa South. Questerre will hold a 
royalty interest in these initial wells and certain subsequent wells 
subject to standard payout provisions. Questerre currently holds a 
100-per-cent interest in 4,480 acres at Kakwa North along with 3,840 
acres at Kakwa South and a 25-per-cent interest in 10,240 acres on its 
joint venture block.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questerre also reported 
on plans for additional activity targeting its shallow mineral rights, 
above and excluding Montney rights, at Kakwa North. The company was 
recently advised by the operator that it plans to drill up to six 
horizontal wells on this acreage in 2018. Questerre holds an overriding 
royalty interest in 4,160 acres of shallow rights at Kakwa North.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questerre Energy</span> is leveraging its 
expertise gained through early exposure to shale and other 
non-conventional reservoirs. The company has base production and 
reserves in the tight <b>oil</b> Bakken/Torquay of southeast 
Saskatchewan. It is bringing on production from its lands in the heart 
of the high liquids Montney shale fairway. It is a leader on <b>social licence</b> to operate issues for its Utica shale gas discovery in the St. Lawrence Lowlands, Quebec.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, some perspective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are thousands of 
Canadian mining companies and thousands of Canadian-affiliated 
exploration projects in different stages of development around the 
globe. In Canada alone, there are roughly 150 to 200 mines in operation.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is <span class="companylink">MiningWatch Canada</span>,
 which provided the numbers above. It is a watchdog organization in 
Canada devoted to covering these thousands of Canadian mining interests 
domestically and worldwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has a staff of five.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, for investors trying 
to weigh the ethical, environmental and social risks and potential 
controversies surrounding certain mines, "it's a real challenge. Even 
for groups like ours, even for the government for that matter, to really
 keep track of that many players, it's a constant challenge," said Ugo 
Lapointe, Canadian program co-ordinator at <span class="companylink">MiningWatch Canada</span> in Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This limited oversight 
means that the biggest mining controversies get the most attention, as 
one would expect. What pushes controversies into becoming major ones – 
and a major disincentive for ethically minded investors – is when a 
situation grabs headlines as a human-rights violation. This includes the
 human right to a clean and healthy environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When I do work across 
Canada, I will respond to calls coming from municipalities, from First 
Nations that are affected by some of these controversial projects. These
 are the projects that we are working on [as the industry watchdog]," 
Mr. Lapointe noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mining projects that 
don't receive strong public complaints can easily get ignored, "which 
doesn't mean there's no problem with them," Mr. Lapointe said. It simply
 means that complaints aren't loud enough and haven't reached the level 
of a watchdog like MiningWatch, which opened its office in 1999 and 
receives the majority of its funding through a diverse group of 
foundations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This adds an extra layer 
of risk. For instance, a mining operation may receive environmental 
approval, but "that doesn't mean that they get the <b>social licence</b>," Mr. Lapointe said. Social issues, from pollution to Indigenous land claims, can still arise, and may be just a <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> storm away. "Now the <b>social licence</b> is as big a risk as any of the other risks," Mr. Lapointe noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the case of First 
Nations, we think not only of proper consultation, but we are talking 
about consent," he said. It's the need for clearer consent from 
communities for projects on their traditional lands, whether it's on 
treaty lands or claim lands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In trying to circumvent 
such risks, there is a movement toward shareholders (typically 
institutional investors and professional money managers with sufficient 
clout, who have the ear of mining executives) to foster more of a 
dialogue with mining companies. Instead of simply screening mining 
stocks from environmentally and ethically conscious investment funds 
(that is, the niche known in the industry as socially responsible 
investing, or SRI), the idea is to engage companies to change certain 
risky policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think things are 
shifting," said Dana Sasarean, lead mining analyst in Toronto at 
Sustainalytics, a firm which analyzes sustainability and other ethical 
risks of companies. "[There's] social media and the fact that there are 
so many better ways for communities to share concerns and to blow the 
whistle, and to make things explode quickly in terms of reputation and 
impact."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chile's ruling that <span class="companylink">Barrick Gold Corp</span>.
 must shut the above-ground plans for its huge Pascua-Lama gold and 
silver mine in the Andes was prompted by strong local opposition 
(although Barrick has been exploring plans to restart the project as an 
underground mine). The project has received criticism from local groups 
concerned with the threat of pollution to water and glaciers in the 
high, arid terrain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The rhetoric of what 
they need to do on the ground to address that is changing. There are new
 ways of engaging with the communities, listening to the communities. 
Not going it alone," Ms. Sasarean said. "I see companies trying to learn
 from other companies."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Catherine Coumans, a 
resource co-ordinator at MiningWatch, who is the one person in the 
watchdog overseeing the entire Asia-Pacific region, is skeptical of this
 emphasis on engagement. She feels it pays lip service to problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Particularly given the 
huge presence of mining in the Canadian economy, it's hard to divest 
entirely from mining, hence the need for the investment community to 
engage mining companies. Critics say this may lead only to further 
studies and promises by the companies to do good, rather than stopping 
the specific practices that local people are fighting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They [the companies] are
 not going to do anything that interferes with the core activity," Ms. 
Coumans said. "And if that core activity is actually harming people, 
then there isn't going to be much that they are going to do about that. 
There is a real disconnect between what SRIs can ask for and get 
companies to do and what needs to happen."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The creation by the 
federal government of the new watchdog office for human-rights abuses 
caused by Canadian companies operating abroad is seen by some as helping
 to create a framework for regulators and companies for addressing 
controversies. A coalition of human-rights organizations (known as the 
Canadian Network of Corporate Accountability of which Mining Watch is a 
member), has been working for years to see the creation of this new 
independent watchdog (called the Canadian Ombudsperson for Responsible 
Enterprise).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But that's not enough. 
That's a non-judicial mechanism," Ms. Coumans at MiningWatch said. "What
 we really need is regulatory change and policy change that will allow 
us to hold parent companies in Canada to account for what their 
subsidiaries overseas are doing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So where does this leave 
investors? One option is to divest and to find alternatives, and a 
precedent might be found with funds that have racked up experience 
screening out energy stocks. Screening out energy has typically meant 
having to diversify more heavily outside of Canadian stocks, to look 
more at global technology and financial sector stocks for the growth 
that mining and energy stocks might provide. But then there is the 
question about whether to screen out all mining shares or just the 
shares of companies facing controversy? And what about banking stocks, 
given the banks' exposure to mining?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's the big trick in this business. What's your exposure to mining? What's your exposure to <b>oil</b>?
 So, we're going to focus more on controversy in terms of the banks, in 
terms of what they're doing in some of these areas," said Wayne Wachell,
 chief executive and chief investment officer of Genus Capital 
Management in Vancouver, which specializes in fossil-free investing. He 
sees some of the same tactics for screening out energy stocks as being 
applicable to controversial mining investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also has similar 
challenges. "It definitely makes ESG investing [an investment focus on 
environmental, social and good governance issues] in Canada very 
difficult, going fossil-free as we are," he said. "If you take out 
energy, and you also screen out mining stocks, you're losing maybe a 
third of your universe."</p>

“scheduling" forced the previous delay and that the tensions were 
irrelevant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is a very important
 issue for the federal government as it is for the government of B.C.," 
said Mr. Wilkinson, a Vancouverarea MP who was representing the federal 
government at the news conference. “There are many files on which we are
 working actively with the government of B.C. This is one of those."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over three years, the 
federal child-care funding will be used for measures that include 
creating 1,370 new child-care spaces, reducing fees and administering 
low-cost spaces for up to 1,786 children and expanding Indigenous child 
care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Edmonton, Alberta 
Premier Rachel Notley said that while she doesn't believe British 
Columbia's legal challenge has merit, her government will be watching it
 closely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Notley said she is 
not sure the B.C. courts will even entertain making a ruling on the 
clearly established constitutional rule that the federal government has 
the final say on what goes into transboundary pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But she said that if B.C.
 can't find traction on that issue, it may try a different legal tack 
and Alberta will be ready to respond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She did not specify the possible options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on Friday, Premier 
John Horgan said neither Prime Minister Justin Trudeau or Premier Notley
 should take comfort in B.C. having referred the matter to the courts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The people of British 
Columbia feel profoundly about this project and the depth of concern 
about it is palatable to anybody who spends any time in the Lower 
Mainland," Mr. Horgan said during a news conference in Richmond. While 
the issue is now headed for the courts, the Premier said issues around “<b>social licence</b>" remain regarding the pipeline project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're far from out of the woods on this issue, and I don't say that with any glee. I say it more out of sorrow."</p>

this way. Not when our premier introduced her much-vaunted carbon tax - 
not in an election campaign, mind you, but after the NDP was somewhat 
unexpectedly ensconced in power. Back then, Rachel Notley waxed lyrical 
about the benefits of imposing this "levy" on us rubes while shutting 
down our nasty coal industry, capping emissions from the oilsands and 
sending out environmental missionaries bearing gifts of free light bulbs
 and the wherewithal to screw them into our sockets. Ouch.</p>

Yet, like a prairie summer, they didn't last. Soon, Notley got a

Thrones on <span class="companylink">Netflix</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First to put the boot into this brave new world of <b>social licence</b>, where we'd scratch the environmental itch and in turn have our tummies tickled in getting <b>oil</b> to tidewater, was Quebec.</p>

gunfight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nope, if we want to see action, it's time to kick into gear the anti-<b>social licence</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It goes like this. First,
 we're ditching the carbon tax. Next, we're reversing the mothballing of
 our coal industry that threatened the existence of so many Alberta

 Copperfield, eat your heart out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, but that's 
irresponsible. We'll be contributing to global warming and the seas will
 rise and threaten coastal areas everywhere. Oh, really? Darn it, but

 bits? It'll be a while before we get our feet wet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Victoria and Vancouver, you say? Oh well, we'll have a whip round and send them some greencoloured sandbags.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then we'll make direct overtures to the U.S. administration about pumping more <b>oil</b> south - it isn't moving in any other direction.

Andrew Weaver, the most powerful Green Party politician in Canada, is a 
smart man. This week he tweeted out a prediction that strikes me as dead
 on. Despite the posturing of Justin Trudeau and Rachel Notley, he said,
 “it is virtually certain" that the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion 
will never be built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why won't it happen? Because despite the approval of the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>
 15 months ago, opposition to the pipeline has only grown. That 
opposition comes not just from environmentalists and First Nations, but 
also from the new provincial government in British Columbia. Most of 
B.C.'s Lower Mainland population oppose it fiercely.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many people are willing to break the law to block it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, Mr. 
Trudeau's calculation has blown up in his face. He thought he could 
square the climate circle by persuading Canadians to build a pipeline 
now in exchange for cutting emissions later. The two, he assures us, are
 inextricably linked. Just trust him, and everyone will be a winner! But
 Mr. Weaver, who is leader of the B.C. Green Party, doesn't buy it. B.C.
 climate expert Mark Jaccard doesn't either. Reduce emissions by 
increasing them? “George Orwell would have fun unpacking this 
black-is-white logic," he mocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be honest, I doubt 
that anyone could have squared this circle. The Prime Minister's 
fundamental mistake was thinking that he could get to yes through logic,
 consensus-building and grand bargains that would secure broad public 
approval, what he calls a “<b>social licence</b>." Maybe that would have
 been possible five years ago. It's not possible today. Too much of the 
opposition to pipelines is religious and existential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Too many opponents 
believe that any pipeline built through their land, or any diluted 
bitumen transported through their waters, is a violation of their rights
 – and, beyond that, a violation of the sacred by the filth of the 
profane. Too many people believe that the only good pipelines are no 
pipelines at all, and they're ready to throw themselves in front of 
bulldozers to stop them. What's Mr. Trudeau supposed to do then? Call in
 the army?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a thousand obstacles must be surmounted before it comes to that. A lot of people are hoping that <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>,
 the pipeline's builder, will just give up and go away. The newly 
elected B.C government is appealing certain jurisdictional issues on 
constitutional grounds. It has ordered a brand-new study to determine 
the impact of a spill of diluted bitumen into coastal waters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(You can be sure there 
will be no consensus on the answers.) Many First Nations are complaining
 they weren't adequately consulted, and that the pipeline will violate 
their territorial sovereignty. Now Mr. Trudeau's government has muddied 
its own waters by declaring that the <span class="companylink">NEB</span> will be replaced by a body with expanded powers and more legitimacy – causing many people to ask how legitimate the <span class="companylink">NEB</span>'s
 approval was in the first place. Most significant of all, Mr. Trudeau 
has vowed to remake Indigenous policy so that he can define a new 
relationship with First Nations people. What that means for Trans 
Mountain is an open question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are not minor 
details. They are major hurdles, and few have cut-anddried answers. 
What's an acceptable risk for the odds of a dilbit spill in the Salish 
Sea? Once every 75 years? Once every 2,000? Never? Who determines the 
odds, and how credible are they?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What about First Nations 
that don't oppose the pipeline but want more of the action? As Harold 
Aljam, economic development co-ordinator for the Coldwater Band, said to
 the ministerial panel that examined the Trans Mountain expansion: “I'd 
like to tax the crap out of it. Canada is at the table. The province is 
at the table. Well, they have to move over so the Shuswap can sit at 
that table."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there are those for 
whom no money is enough. “I sit up nights wondering what a spill into 
the Coquihalla River might look like," Cheam chief Ernie Crey told the 
panel. “Even a small spill into the Coquihalla would devastate salmon in
 the Fraser River and plunge First Nations into utter destitution. 
Global trade, investment, jobs: I know those are important, but consider
 what could be lost." No facts and safety studies can answer an 
objection like that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You may believe, as I do, that it's ridiculous to leave hundreds of billions of dollars on the table because we can't get our <b>oil</b> to tidewater. You may believe that modern <b>oil</b>
 transport methods are extremely safe, and that we are beggaring 
ourselves for nothing. Thanks to explosive increases in production, the 
United States is becoming the world's biggest <b>oil</b> producer while 
we fight among ourselves. You may believe that although Mr. Trudeau 
doesn't know the way to Paris, Mr. Weaver and Mr. Jaccard don't either. 
If pressed, even they would have to admit that whatever Canada does or 
doesn't do makes hardly any difference in the global scheme of things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The truth is that in the 
global scheme of things, one pipeline more or less is entirely symbolic.
 But symbols have enormous power. And those who care the most about them
 are more likely to come out on the winning side.</p>

 October 2016, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's announcement that 
Canadian provinces would be required to adopt carbon pricing was met 
with wide political agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both the United States 
and China had recently agreed to the Paris climate accord, and 
provincial governments in Canada's three largest provinces had already 
committed to some form of carbon pricing.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta,
 home of Canada's most abundant oilsands and a traditional bastion of 
conservative support, had broken with decades of Progressive 
Conservative leadership, electing an NDP government that presented 
carbon pricing as a critical part of the <b>oil</b> industry's <b>social licence</b>
 to export its products to market. Across the country, Liberal 
provincial governments held power. Conservatives were at a historically 
low ebb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former prime minister 
Stephen Harper's inability to adequately address climate change had hurt
 perceptions of Canadian resources; a new approach was needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What a difference 16 
months make. Alberta is locked in a battle with its provincial 
counterparts in British Columbia over the Trans Mountain Pipeline. While
 the federal government has expressed support for the project, the 
provincial governments are no longer in the same agreeable position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Albertans, who have long 
memories of the misguided National Energy Program devised by Pierre 
Elliott Trudeau's government, are increasingly conscious of the 
oilsands' vulnerabilities and are strongly resistant to any measures 
that may diminish its growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enter Jason Kenney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Breaking from years of 
the Alberta Progressive Conservative Party's efforts to court a bigger 
tent of voters, the former Harper cabinet minister has united the 
province's right-wing forces under a series of unapologetically 
conservative stances, including strident opposition to the carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As this takes place, action and rhetoric from the Trump administration has added pressure to Canadian <b>oil</b> producers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Prime Minister Trudeau and former U.S. president Barack Obama struck similar tones about building <b>social licence</b> for <b>oil</b> extraction, Trump has a drastically different vision for competitiveness, unlocking millions of jobs by slashing regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suddenly, carbon pricing is facing serious political headwinds as conservatives across Canada spring into action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some Conservatives 
briefly toyed with Michael Chong's plan for a revenue-neutral carbon 
tax, Andrew Scheer won the leadership race by promising to scrap carbon 
pricing. He rejects the premise that taxes can fight climate change and 
has ardently emphasized their impact on affordability. The recent 
political climate has only contributed to his resolve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has allies. With 
Trump's election, the Liberal's newly created Canadian Energy Regulator 
and the harsh impact of the oilsands downturn on our national 
productivity, carbon pricing is beginning to feel like too much too soon
 for many Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in an era where 
political conversations are increasingly framed around affordability, 
the added burden of taxes has become problematic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This explains the recent 
shift in Ontario politics. Former Progressive Conservative Party of 
Ontario leader Patrick Brown shocked pundits and delegates alike when he
 announced his support for a revenue-neutral carbon tax in March 2016. 
Many pundits saw this as a critical point in national discussions around
 carbon pricing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But his swift removal as 
leader has provided a window for anti-carbon-pricing advocates to 
rebound in Ontario. While there may have been no appetite for such a 
position in 2016, leadership candidates are now willing to fight against
 carbon taxation in spades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All three leading 
leadership candidates for the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario 
have promised to oppose cap and trade, carbon taxation and any form of 
carbon pricing in no uncertain terms. Call it pandering. Call it 
impractical. But it represents a growing and formidable opposition from 
the most likely candidates to take over as premier of Canada's largest 
province this June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To add to that, 
Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe threatened that Trudeau's government 
would enforce the carbon tax on his province over his " dead body."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's clear is that 
after several years of standing down on the issue of the carbon tax, 
conservative parties and politicians are no longer willing to sit idly 
by and allow the Liberals to steer the agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's problematic for 
the federal government is that, in many provinces, those same vocal 
opponents look to be set on a path to power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as the political 
tides have turned on this issue before, it seems they have once again - 
at least amongst the conservative base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result? Prime Minister Trudeau has a fight on his hands.</p>

 of bills in this country, transfer payments and a lot of jobs ... 
because right now it looks like most of the country is ashamed of it," 
Wall told Postmedia News.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a source of shame 
for the federal government, for ministers of the federal government who 
will talk about the economy and environment living together, but every 
single policy decision and even a lack of action on Trans Mountain 
lately indicates they'd just (prefer) this industry not exist here."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada, he said, is in 
danger of losing its national cohesion in favour of provincial or 
regional self interest as B.C. attempts to thwart Alberta's plans of 
moving oilsands bitumen to the west coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're at a crossroads. I'm worried about where we're at," Wall said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you look at the cumulative effect of everything the federal government has done, we're in the middle of NEP 2.0."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those comments came two 
days after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued his strongest words 
supporting the pipeline, saying B.C. premier John Horgan's stance 
threatens to scuttle climate change action pushed by Alberta as a <b>social licence</b> for energy development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa has insisted the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline expansion will occur and says its officials have been working behind the scenes to ensure it does.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Feb. 2, Trudeau was relentlessly heckled by pipeline opponents at a town-hall meeting in Nanaimo, B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of those opponents 
have accused the federal government of ignoring scientific reports 
stating considerable uncertainty remains over the ability to limit 
damage caused by bitumen spills in the ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked whether Notley is doing enough to further Alberta's interests with Trans Mountain, Wall said she can't relent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"She needs to continue to
 do everything, to leave no stone unturned, to make sure the 
implications of this are understood across the country," he said, noting
 Notley's boycott of B.C. wine and the creation of a task force on the 
dispute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he said Notley's 
hopes that implementing a carbon tax would mitigate environmental 
concerns around energy projects have been both misguided and dashed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This notion around <b>social licence</b> is nonsense ... for some of the NGOs who are fighting <b>oil</b> and the B.C. NDP and the left in general, the self-immolation of a carbon tax has bought zero <b>social licence</b>," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a survey of 
938 respondents conducted last week by pollster Insight West shows 48 
per cent of British Columbians support the pipeline expansion, while 44 
per cent are opposed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The highest level of 
opposition was in Metro Vancouver, with 49 per cent not in favour.
