<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently
 in Ontario, Premier Doug Ford summarily scrapped Ontario's cap-andtrade
 program, which would have burdened Ontario companies with costly carbon
 accounting and sent millions of Ontario's dollars to California to buy 
carbon credits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2017, Ontarians paid nearly $2 billion annually as the cost of cap-and-trade was passed onto consumers.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover,
 Ontario will cancel some 758 contracts for renewable power, saving the 
province another $790 million while helping reduce power prices for 
Ontarians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides partying at 
Stampede and doing aerial acrobatics, what has Premier Rachel Notley 
done to increase investment attractiveness in Alberta? Let's review. 
Since coming to office, she raised corporate income taxes to 12% from 
10% - a hike of about 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And discouraged wealthier folks, who might live and invest here, by killing Alberta's highly attractive flat income tax rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Due to this tax hike, 
which went from 10% up to 15% for high earners, Albertans who earn more 
than $300,000 per year saw their taxes rise 50%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP government has 
also stacked a daunting pile of regulatory bricks onto the back of a 
prostrate industry when it was reeling from a massive drop in oil 
prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Canada's <b>energy</b>
 sector was down, they were hit with Premier Notley's "Climate 
Leadership Plan," which expanded and increased Alberta's carbon tax to 
$30/tonne of emissions, and will ostensibly follow the Trudeau 
government's federal plan to raise the tax to $50/tonne by 2022, as her 
contingent condition of getting a pipeline built was satisfied by 
Ottawa's purchase of the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain expansion project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the tax 
hikes, the government put a hard cap on the emissions of greenhouse 
gases from the oilsands, limiting them to 100 megatonnes per year, a 
constraint which could start to bite in the mid-2020s, threatening the 
viability of longterm projects and costing the economy billions in lost 
production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's Climate Leadership Plan also includes a commitment to phase out coal-generated electricity by 2030, triple renewable <b>energy</b>
 to supply 30% of generation by 2030, further reduce methane emissions 
from the oil and gas sector, and create a new agency to spend Alberta's 
carbon tax revenues on <b>energy</b>-efficiency programs with a very poor record of success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drove up prices</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are the kind of policies that drove up <b>energy</b> prices in Ontario and drove investment and jobs out of the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simply put, as Ontario 
steps back from cap-andtrade and wind and solar power, Alberta forges 
ahead with burdensome regulations, renewable <b>energy</b> subsidies and higher taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And all of this after the spectacular failure of Premier Notley's "<b>social license</b>" dream that was never going to be granted by environmentalists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, we now have a 
precedent that, if pipelines are to be built, the government must fund 
them or indemnify them with Alberta's and Canada's tax dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the premier is serious
 about rebuilding Alberta's oil and gas sector, she should get off the 
Stampede zip-line and start removing the bricks she put on the back of

 pundits should not be so quick to write off the new Doug Ford-Scott Moe
 alliance against the federal carbon tax. Yes, they were the only two of
 the 10 premiers in New Brunswick this week to announce their support 
for a constitutional challenge to the federal law. And yes 
constitutional experts are correct in predicting that this legal 
challenge is not likely to succeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But winning in the legal 
battle does not mean winning the policy war. Obstructionist provincial 
governments can gum up federal policies whose effective implementation 
require provincial co-operation. Witness how B.C. Premier Phil Horgan 
and his anti-pipeline allies have succeeded in delaying the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline expansion despite losing 17 consecutive court decisions.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With
 respect to the carbon tax, the law may be on the side of Ottawa, but 
time and politics are not. Saskatchewan's reference to its court of 
appeal won't be decided for another nine months. Whoever loses will 
appeal to the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>, 
which will take another year or more to be heard and then decided. By 
then, there will have been a spring election in Alberta and a federal 
election in the fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Alberta, Conservative 
leader Jason Kenney is promising to scrap that province's carbon tax if 
he wins next year's election. All current polling suggests that he will.
 Manitoba has adopted its own version of a carbon tax, but the price it 
places on CO2 is below the minimum demanded by the federal plan. Premier
 Pallister has warned that if Ottawa tries to force it higher, "we'll 
see you in court." PEI has adopted a climate change plan with no carbon 
tax - a policy that clearly does not meet federal regulations. And if 
anti-tax momentum builds, the Newfoundland and New Brunswick premiers 
have warned that they are not going impose a tax on their voters that 
consumers and businesses in six or seven other provinces are not paying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Jason Kenney speaks to the media at his first convention as leader of 
the United Conservative Party in Red Deer, Alta., Sunday, May 6, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With next year's federal 
election fast approaching, this is potential nightmare scenario for 
Trudeau and the Liberals. Do they want to make the ballot-issue a new 
tax that will make it more expensive for voters to fill up their cars, 
heat their homes and turn on their lights? Maybe this won't make any 
difference in Saskatchewan and Alberta, where the Liberals only have 
five MPs. But in Ontario - where Doug Ford just won by promising to 
scrap the tax - the Liberals have 80 MPs seeking re-election. Losing 
even a quarter of these would jeopardize their 183 seat government, 
which is only 13 over the 170 minimum required for a majority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2015, many 
centre-right voters supported Trudeau simply because they were tired of 
Stephen Harper. But in 2018, they supported Doug Ford because they were 
tired of sky-rocketing electricity and gas prices. If in 2019 Trudeau 
takes a hardline on bringing back the very carbon tax that Premier Ford 
has just repealed, he risks losing some of these former supporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the alternative - 
backing off on the carbon tax - has its own risks. Promising action on 
climate change was one of the issues that helped Trudeau win in 2015. 
With the help of the U.S.-financed environmental NGO (ENGO) LeadNow, the
 Liberals targeted 29 Conservative-held ridings in which their polling 
indicated that climate change was a priority for voters. Liberal 
candidates subsequently won 25 of these seats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these same 
centre-left voters that supported Trudeau in 2015 are no longer so happy
 with him. Many are angry about the federal government's $4.5 billion 
bailout of the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline 
expansion in B.C. If Trudeau now backs down on his national carbon tax 
pledge, many of his 2015 supporters for whom climate action is still a 
priority may drift off to the NDP in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underlying the Liberals' carbon tax dilemma is the spectacular failure of the Trudeau-Notley "<b>social license</b>"
 gambit: their belief that in return for their various carbon reduction 
policies, climate change ENGOs would acquiesce in Canada's economic need
 to build the Kinder Morgan TransMountain expansion. Whatever 
plausibility this trade-off strategy may have had initially has now been
 destroyed. The anti-Kinder Morgan forces - the Horgan government, U.S. 
and Canadian climate ENGOs and B.C. aboriginal groups - have accelerated
 their opposition to TransMountain, not backed off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor are they shy about 
explaining why. When CBC asked Bill McKibben( 
http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1100225603963[http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1100225603963]
 ), founder of <span class="companylink">350.org</span>, why he would 
not give Trudeau and Notley any credit for Canada's carbon reduction 
policies, he stated a simple fact: that at only two per cent of global 
emissions, what Canada does on the domestic "demand" side to reduce our 
emissions is too small to make any difference. What will make a 
difference, McKibbon continued, is preventing the further development of
 the Canadian oil sands - the third largest reserve on the world. "To 
stop the oil sands, we have to stop all pipelines."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The failure of his <b>social license</b> strategy forced Trudeau to rescue the TransMountain expansion with the $4.5 billion dollar purchase of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada</span>.
 This did not win him many new friends in Alberta or Saskatchewan, but 
infuriated many of his erstwhile climate change supporters in Ontario 
and British Columbia. With an election only a year away, the carbon tax 
issue threatens to push the Liberals even deeper into a political corner
 with no easy way out.</p>

 and to minimize its impacts on the developing economies it hopes to 
serve, an array of methane experts said at the World Gas Conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Climate change has the potential to destabilize growing and struggling marketplaces, and <b>energy</b>
 operators looking to sell their resources in those markets should be 
mindful that adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere could inhibit 
economic growth, Rachel Kyte, CEO of Sustainable <b>Energy</b> for All, said June 28 at the Washington, D.C., event.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Gas
 will not be a solution for poverty in a world where climate change is 
driving more people into poverty unless you fix your methane problem and
 fix it quick," Kyte said during a keynote address. "My message to you 
is I think there's a very important role for gas in cleaning the <b>energy</b> mix, in reaching people who don't have reliable and affordable <b>energy</b> today, in helping their economies grow, but let's not leave the room with the elephant still in there, untouched."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reducing methane on a 
global scale would be likely to require public-private partnerships, in 
addition to "very strong" regulatory regimes, she said. Her organization
 was founded by former U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The oil and gas industry 
is "only as good as the lowest common denominator," Richard Ward, global
 methane program director at the <span class="companylink">Rocky Mountain Institute</span>, told a panel of methane experts June 26 at the same event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some companies have made 
commitments to reduce methane emissions, but the less proactive 
operators may increasingly put the industry as a whole in the crosshairs
 of environmental advocates looking to hold down greenhouse gas 
emissions, Ward said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Those are your brethren," Ward said. "Those [companies] emit the same molecules to the same sky for the same global warming."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operators should not 
assume the issue of methane emissions will not affect them if they keep a
 low profile, said Jennifer Stewart, Southwestern <b>Energy</b> Co.'s 
vice president of government and regulatory affairs. Stewart, who was on
 the June 26 panel, agreed that there is a need to bring lagging 
companies along when it comes to minimizing methane emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and her colleague Roy
 Hartstein, Southwestern's vice president of strategic solutions, 
indicated that they are "agnostic" about whether regulations are the 
appropriate way to restrict methane emissions from oil and gas 
operations. Hartstein highlighted changing practices among operators in 
recent decades that have already limited the amount of methane that 
companies release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a pair of scientists 
cautioned against overestimating how much progress the oil and gas 
sector has made on reducing emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There have been 
assertions that the rate of emissions is going down. I don't know if 
that's true, and I don't know if anyone else knows that that's true," 
Steven Hamburg, chief scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, said 
during a question session after the panel discussion. "There are 
well-documented improvements in some practices. The trouble is ... we 
can document those, we can applaud those, but in the aggregate, we can't
 say, 'If we continue the trend we're on now, we're going to get to 
where we need to be.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atmospheric methane 
levels have increased but not at the same rate as oil and gas operations
 have expanded in recent decades, said Stefan Schwietzke, a research 
scientist at the University of Colorado and the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration. Even if all the increase in methane 
emissions has been from the fossil fuel industry, the disparity between 
methane and development growth rates indicates that the oil and gas 
sector has gotten more efficient at holding in its emissions, Schwietzke
 said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But all these 
improvements, they have been counteracted by increased production," 
Schwietzke said. "We can increase our efficiency, reduce emissions per 
well ... but if we're doubling the wells, doubling production, we see 
the same methane in the atmosphere."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inferred Mineral Resource
 Notes:(1) Mineral resources are reported as of November 6, 2017. (2) 
Mineral resources do not have demonstrated economic viability. Currently
 there are no environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, 
sociopolitical, marketing, or other relevant issues that effect this 
mineral resource estimate, but these factors could effect the estimate 
in the future. (3) The quantity and grade of reported Inferred mineral 
resources in this estimation are conceptual in nature and there has been
 insufficient exploration to define these Inferred mineral resources as 
an Indicated or Measured mineral resource. It is reasonable to expect 
that the majority of Inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to 
Indicated or Measured mineral resources with continued exploration. (4) 
The mineral resources in this estimate were calculated with the <span class="companylink">Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum</span> (“CIM”), CIM Standards on <span class="companylink">Mineral Resources</span>
 and Reserves, Definitions and Guidelines prepared by the CIM Standing 
Committee on Reserve Definitions. (5) Gold equivalent values were 
calculated using the following prices: for gold a price of US$1,400 per 
ounce, for copper a price of US$3.25 per pound, for molybdenum a price 
of US$10.00 per pound and for silver a price of US$17.00 per ounce. Gold
 equivalent values can be calculated using the following formula: AuEq =
 Au g/t + (Ag g/t x 0.0122) + (Cu % x 1.592) + (Mo ppm / 10,000 x 
4.898). (6) The base case cut-off grade for the estimate of mineral 
resources is 0.35g/t AuEq. (7) The Inferred mineral resources are 
contained within a limiting pit shell and comprise a coherent body. (8) 
Total may not add up due to rounding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This mineral resource 
estimate was prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 and was based on a 
total of 18,015 metres of diamond drilling in 50 holes. Of these, 10,376
 metres in 23 holes were drilled by Lumina, 6,237 metres in 23 holes 
were drilled by the project’s previous operator, Newmont Mining 
Corporation (“Newmont”), in joint venture with Lumina’s predecessor 
company, <span class="companylink">Odin Mining and Exploration Ltd</span>
 (“Odin”) and 1,402 metres in 4 holes were drilled by Odin after the 
joint venture was dissolved. Inferred mineral resources are estimated 
using a three-dimensional block model with a nominal block size of 10 x 
10 x 10 metres. Drill holes penetrate the Cangrejos deposit at a variety
 of orientations to depths approaching 700 metres below surface. The 
resource estimate was generated using drill hole sample assay results 
and the interpretation of a geological model which relates to the 
spatial distribution of gold, copper, silver and molybdenum. 
Interpolation characteristics were defined based on the geology, drill 
hole spacing, and geostatistical analysis of the data. The effects of 
potentially anomalous high-grade sample data, composited to 2 metre 
intervals, are controlled using both traditional top-cutting as well as 
limiting the distance of influence during block grade interpolation. 
Block grades are estimated using ordinary kriging and have been 
validated using a combination of visual and statistical methods. Blocks 
in the model within a maximum distance of 150 metres from a drill hole 
are included in the Inferred category. A series of surfaces were 
generated that represent types of surface oxidation including the base 
of saprolite, saprock and oxidation. The information for these surfaces 
is derived from observations recorded during core logging. This mineral 
resource estimate excludes all saprolite and saprock material from the 
estimate. The estimate of the Inferred mineral resource is within a 
limiting pit shell derived using projected technical and economic 
parameters.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mining and Processing Facility</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The PEA contemplates 
large-scale open pit mining using a 100% owner operated equipment fleet.
 Four mining phases were designed using a technique that optimizes 
present value by discounting the value of ore-grade mineralization 
relative to the cost of mining overlying waste rock. Mine production and
 concentrator feed schedules were estimated from the phase resource 
tabulations using a declining cut-off grade strategy to maximize present
 value for an initial ore processing rate of 40 ktpd, with an expansion 
to 80 ktpd at the beginning of Year 6. A 15-month pre-production 
stripping period, allowing for personnel and equipment ramp-ups, is 
contemplated to expose sufficient ore for initial concentrator 
operations. Haul road construction and clearing and grubbing of the pit 
area is expected to largely be performed by contractors prior to the 
commencement of pre-production stripping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed processing 
plant for Cangrejos is a conventional copper-gold flotation concentrator
 with a gravity circuit. It has been designed to treat 40 ktpd (14.6 
Mtpa) of mineralized material during the first five years of operation 
and then be expanded to process 80 ktpd (29.2 Mtpa) thereafter. 
Near-surface saprolite and saprock materials are not included in the 
current processing plan, as they respond poorly to the concentration 
processes. There is an opportunity to extract mineralization from 
approximately 10 Mt of this material with further metallurgical studies 
and modifications to the processing circuit, which is anticipated to be 
considered at the Pre-Feasibility Study stage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A trade-off study was 
conducted that compared SAG and Ball mill grinding to High Pressure 
Grinding Rolls and Ball mill grinding. For this PEA, a SAG and Ball mill
 grinding circuit was selected after evaluating the difference between 
the relative operating and capital cost. The process flow sheet begins 
with a primary crusher adjacent to the pit and an overland conveyor to 
the plant. The plant consists of SAG and ball mills, gravity gold 
concentrators, copper and molybdenum concentration circuits and 
thickening and filtering for flotation tailings. The tailings are 
planned to be conveyed to the dry stack tailings facility. The plant is 
designed to produce a gravity gold concentrate, a copper-gold flotation 
concentrate and a molybdenum concentrate that will be trucked to an 
Ecuadorian port approximately 40 km away and shipped to smelters and 
refiners for further processing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Metallurgical Recoveries and Test Work Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent test work 
(2015-2018) was completed by C.H. Plenge &amp; CIA S.A. at its 
laboratory in Lima, Peru, using representative composites, that 
confirmed the material from Cangrejos is amenable to a conventional 
crush, grind, gravity concentration and flotation flow sheet. The 
selected processing scheme produces separate saleable gravity gold, 
copper-gold and molybdenum concentrates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comminution tests 
indicate that the materials are hard and moderately abrasive. Fresh rock
 and oxide samples have Bond Ball Mill work indices ranging from 14 
kWh/t to 17 kWh/t and JKTech specific <b>energy</b> values averaging 12.3 kWh/t.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gravity concentration 
tests on fresh rock indicate that 37% of the gold and 9% of the silver 
can be recovered into a gravity gold concentrate. Lock-cycle flotation 
of fresh rock gravity tailings indicates that a bulk 
copper-gold-molybdenum concentrate with 21% copper can be produced, 
under which copper, gold and molybdenum recoveries are projected to be 
82%, 45% and 65% respectively. Overall gold recovery is projected to be 
82% (including both gravity concentration and flotation recovery 
methods). Final molybdenum recovery is projected at 50% in the 
molybdenum concentrate. Flotation recoveries from Saprolite and Saprock 
materials were very low and did not produce a saleable flotation 
concentrate, driving the decision to treat the material as 
pre-production waste. Flotation of oxide material, however, resulted in a
 saleable flotation concentrate that assayed 16% copper. It is projected
 that 65% of the gold and 50% of the copper will be recovered into the 
flotation concentrate. See Table 6 for a summary of the applied 
recoveries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cyanidation tests on 
fresh rock recovered 92% of the gold and 66% of the silver. This 
processing method was not pursued as it does not recover copper or 
molybdenum.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dry Stack Tailings and Waste Rock Storage Facilities</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A siting and tailings 
disposal methodology study was performed for the PEA with the goal of 
balancing capital costs, operating costs and non-monetary considerations
 such as environmental and social impact. <span class="companylink">Ausenco</span>
 identified several potential sites and evaluated their suitability. The
 result of the study indicated that the best option for the Project is a
 Dry Stack Tailings Facility (“DSTF”). This approach has a smaller 
footprint, positive environmental and social benefits, as well as 
reduced operating costs when compared to the other Project Wet Tailings 
Storage Facility options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The DSTF is proposed to 
be located at the mine in close proximity to the plant site. This will 
allow for simple access for the overland conveyor from the plant to 
transport filtered tailings to the edge of the DSTF and then mobile 
conveyors and a radial stacking system will be used to place the 
tailings. As lifts are completed, it is planned that they will be 
progressively closed by grading the slopes and covering them with a 
growth media and revegetating them to reduce erosion and help stabilize 
the slopes. The facility area is approximately 240 hectares, which is 
expected to contain approximately 339 Mt of tailings, along with having 
significant future expansion potential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Waste Rock Storage 
Facility (“WRSF”) for the Project is proposed to be located in a closed 
drainage basin south of the open pit and will hold nearly 380 Mt of 
waste rock, saprolite and saprock according to the mine production 
schedule. The facility is planned to be constructed in 20 metre lifts 
from the bottom up. To the extent possible, saprolite and saprock will 
be stored away from the toe areas of the WRSF and at higher elevations 
to facilitate capping the facility with growth media. As the facility 
dumping levels rise, lower slopes are expected to be regraded, covered 
with growth media and revegetated to reduce erosion and help stabilize 
the slopes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Geochemistry work to date
 indicates that both the DSTF and WRSF are unlikely to be acid 
generating based on results of acid-based accounting, paste pH testing 
and short-term leaching tests. The tailings and waste rock contain low 
sulphide concentrations and naturally-occurring neutralizing minerals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Power Infrastructure and Water Requirements</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Connected power 
requirements for the construction period, 40 ktpd phase and 80 ktpd 
phase require 10 megawatts (“MW”), 80 MW, and 155MW, respectively. 
Actual power draw, or demand, is approximately 70% of the connected 
load. An Ecuadorian power supply consultant, EPTEC, has confirmed that 
there is sufficient capacity in the Ecuadorian National Electric 
Transmission System (“NTS”) to meet the requirements of the Project. 
EPTEC recommended a connection point to the NTS at the new Avanzada 
Substation planned for completion in 2021. Transmission to the Project’s
 main substation will consist of a single circuit 230kV transmission 
line over a distance of approximately 19 km. Construction period power 
supply is anticipated to be from diesel generation until the main 
substation and transmission line has been completed. A power cost of 
$0.063 per kWh has been used for the PEA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial work on 
hydrogeology and water balance has determined there will be adequate 
water for the Project from on-site or nearby water sources, even in 
drought conditions. Water consumption is unlikely to impact local water 
users because the selection of a dry-stack tailings alternative permits 
large-scale water reuse and recycling. Due to a high water level in the 
pit, pit dewatering will be required. The Project is anticipated to have
 two separate groundwater management systems: in-pit dewatering sumps 
and horizontal borings to depressurize the pit slopes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employment and Corporate Social Responsibility</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the construction 
period, the Project is projected to hire approximately 530 full time 
employees, which does not include outside contractors. Over the 16 year 
mine life it is expected that the Project will employ approximately 600 
to 900 people depending on Project’s production phase. During production
 it is anticipated that approximately 50 employees will be dedicated to 
community, environmental and health and safety work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lumina is committed to earning and maintaining a robust <b>social license</b>
 to operate its Cangrejos mineral exploration and mine development 
operations in Ecuador. Community relations programs remain an ongoing 
corporate priority. The Project was designed to meet Ecuadorian 
environmental regulations, international mining industry best management
 practices and appropriate international lending institution guidelines.
 As such, significant human and financial resources have been factored 
into the PEA to meet environmental obligations and social commitments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taxes Applied in the Economic Model</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The PEA incorporates a 5%
 Net Smelter Royalty (“NSR”) payable to the Ecuadorian Government 
(“Government”), 15% Profit Sharing Tax (12% state and 3% employee), 22% 
Corporate Tax and several other local and municipal taxes. Lumina is not
 currently making an assumption for the pre-payment of a portion of the 
5% NSR as this will not be negotiated with the Government until post a 
Pre-Feasibility Study. No Sovereign Adjustment Payment was deemed 
necessary for inclusion in the PEA. The Ecuadorian Windfall Tax does not
 apply to the Project under the commodity price scenarios that are 
utilized in the PEA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next Steps at Cangrejos</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lumina plans to continue 
its current infill, step-out and depth extension drilling program at 
Cangrejos to further delineate open areas to the south, north, west and 
at depth. Following the completion of this program, Lumina expects to 
advance the Project to a Pre-Feasibility Study.</p>

<span class="companylink">Horizon Petroleum</span> Announces NI51-101 Reserves and -2-</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">History and Development Plan</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lachowice field is at
 an early stage of conventional natural gas development. Lachowice-1, 
Lachowice-7 and Stryszawa-2K are the primary wells of interest on the 
field and, despite being essentially vertical in their design and 
utilizing sub-optimal drilling and completion methods for naturally 
fractured formations, tested at rates of up to 5.8 MMcf/d, 8.9 MMcf/d, 
and 2.5 MMcf/d, respectively. Each of these wells was drilled and 
tested, with reservoir depths of 3,000-4,000 meters targeting a 
naturally fractured carbonate reservoir of Middle Devonian age. The 
natural gas is sweet, with up to 91% methane and 7 bbls/MMcf of 
condensate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following receipt of the 
Reserves Report, Horizon is currently in the process of finalizing its 
development plan. In general, it is currently anticipated that the 
development plan would begin with a new vertical well offsetting the 
Lachowice-7 location. Provided Horizon successfully closes the 
Acquisition, it is targeting to drill and test the well in the first 
half of 2019, with first production to occur by late 2019, with natural 
gas sales initially facilities constrained at approximately 3.0 MMcfe/d.
 The wells will produce natural gas under primary drive via the natural 
fractures and the matrix porosity within the reservoir. The project is 
considered pre-development and is expected to cost approximately US$7.5 
million to first production. In a previous press release dated September
 19, 2017, Horizon had stated it was targeting first production from the
 Lachowice field by the second half of 2018. The regulatory process has 
proceeded slower than anticipated, and therefore the conversion of the 
concessions to the new Polish concession laws, and approvals related to 
Horizon taking operatorship of the concessions, has taken longer than 
expected. It is Horizon's understanding that the Polish government is 
currently considering these concessions, and the conversion and 
approvals are expected within the next six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new horizontal or 
highly deviated well and a horizontal or highly deviated re-entry of the
 new vertical well (targeting &gt;300m natural gas column) would be 
drilled in mid-2020, increasing production to 17.5 MMcfe/d at a new 
processing facility expected to be operational in late 2020. Drilling 
would continue with production increases to over 30 MMcfe/d thereafter. 
Operating netbacks are expected to be approximately US$6.80 per Mcfe, 
based on current pricing. Timing of the development is subject to 
regulatory approvals, and Horizon has initiated efforts to begin and 
fast-track the regulatory process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other Assets - France</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In France, the government
 passed a law on December 30, 2017 preventing new oil and natural gas 
licences to be issued, and all production on existing permits to cease 
by 2040. The Company has allowed its Ger licence to expire and has 
applied for a three-year extension on its Ledeuix licence. To the 
Company's knowledge, other companies operating in France have received 
extensions, and as such the Company has no reason to believe that it 
will not receive approval on the extension in 12-18 months. Currently, 
as there is no clarity on timing to first production, the Company will 
initiate the seismic and drilling applications but reduce all 
expenditures in France to minimum levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">C$5 Million Financing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horizon proposes to raise
 up to C$5 million through a private placement, issuing up to 
100,000,000 common shares at a price of $0.05 per share. The net 
proceeds are to be used to close the Acquisition, prepare the assets for
 development and for general corporate purposes. Horizon has entered 
into an engagement agreement with Gneiss <b>Energy</b> Limited, a London, United Kingdom based <b>energy</b>-focused
 advisory practice, for the purposes of raising new equity in Europe. In
 addition, Horizon will raise additional funds from Canadian and certain
 UK investors on a non-brokered basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horizon is currently 
examining options for improving the Company's trading liquidity, access 
to new equity capital in Europe and profile alongside its international 
E&amp;P peers. As part of these deliberations, Horizon may consider 
listing on another exchange, such as the <span class="companylink">London Stock Exchange</span>. In the event the Company decides to undertake an additional listing, it expects to execute a plan within the next 6-12 months.</p>

estimates contained in this press release have been prepared in 
accordance with NI 51-101, is dated as of January 31, 2018 and prepared 
by APEX.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reserve and resource 
estimates of natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves provided in 
this news release are estimates only, and there is no guarantee that the
 estimated reserves and/or resources will be recovered. Actual reserves 
and resources may eventually prove to be greater than, or less than, the
 estimates provided herein. It should not be assumed that the estimates 
of future net revenues presented herein represent the fair market value 
of the reserves and/or resources. There are numerous uncertainties 
inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and natural gas liquids
 reserves and/or resources and the future cash flows attributed to such 
reserves and/or resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These risks and 
uncertainties include but are not limited to: (i) the fact that there is
 no certainty that the zones of interest will exist to the extent 
estimated or that the zones will be found to have natural gas with 
characteristics that meet or exceed the minimum criteria in terms of net
 pay thickness and/or porosity, or that the natural gas will be 
commercially recoverable to the extent estimated; (ii) the fact that 
there is no certainty that any portion of the probable reserves and 
contingent and prospective resources will be commercially viable to 
produce; (iii) the fact that the Company must hire an operations team 
and executive team in both Calgary and Poland in order to execute on the
 development plan, and there are no guarantees that suitably qualified 
technical and professional staff and/or consultants will be available; 
(iv) the lack of additional financing to fund the Company's development 
activities and continued operations; (v) the risks associated with 
obtaining approvals to access land to drill wells or install 
infrastructure and facilities in a reasonable time frame; the Polish 
regulatory regime is relatively stable but is marked with long approval 
processes relative to North American jurisdictions; (vi) the risks in 
acquiring or constructing adequate natural gas infrastructure to produce
 and sell natural gas, and whether capacity will be available in the 
existing main pipeline system at reasonable costs; (vii) the risk that 
there may not be a drilling rig available to drill the required wells, 
and the risk that if a rig mobilization is required from outside of 
Poland, that the costs may be prohibitive; (ix) risks inherent in the 
international oil and natural gas industry; (x) fluctuations in foreign 
exchange and interest rates; (xi)the number of competitors in the oil 
and gas industry with greater technical, financial and operations 
resources and staff; (xii) fluctuations in world prices and markets for 
oil and natural gas due to domestic, international, political, social, 
economic and environmental factors beyond the Company's control; (xiii) 
changes in government regulations affecting oil and natural gas 
operations; (xiv) potential liabilities for pollution or hazards against
 which the Company cannot adequately insure or which the Company may 
elect not to insure; (xv) contingencies affecting the classification as 
reserves versus resources which relate to the following issues as 
detailed in the COGE Handbook: ownership considerations, drilling 
requirements, testing requirements, regulatory considerations, 
infrastructure and market considerations, timing of production and 
development, and economic requirements; (xvi) the fact that there is no 
certainty that any portion of the prospective resources will be 
discovered and if discovered, there is no certainty that it will be 
commercially viable to produce any portion of the resources; and (xvii) 
other factors beyond the Company's control.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resources are defined in the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook (COGEH) Volume 1, section 5 as follows:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources are 
those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from known accumulations, but the applied 
projects are not yet considered mature enough for commercial development
 due to one or more contingencies. Contingent Resources may include, for
 example, projects for which there are currently no viable markets, or 
where commercial recovery is dependent on technology under development, 
or where evaluation of the accumulation is insufficient to clearly 
assess commerciality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingencies may include
 factors such as economic, legal, environmental, political, and 
regulatory matters, or a lack of markets. It is also appropriate to 
classify as contingent resources, the estimated discovered recoverable 
quantities associated with a project in the early evaluation stage. 
Contingent Resources are further classified in accordance with the level
 of certainty associated with the estimates and may be sub classified 
based on project maturity and/or characterized by their economic status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all technically 
feasible development plans will be commercial. The commercial viability 
of a development project is dependent on the forecast of fiscal 
conditions over the life of the project. For Contingent Resources, the 
risk component relating to the likelihood that an accumulation will be 
commercially developed is referred to as the "chance of development." 
For contingent resources, the chance of commerciality is equal to the 
chance of development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development Pending are 
contingencies that are being actively pursued; expect resolution in a 
reasonable time period; are directly influenced by the developer with 
both, internal approvals and commitment and development timing and; have
 a high chance of development (&gt;80%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development on Hold are 
contingencies with major non-technical contingencies identified; have a 
reasonable chance of development (&gt;50%); have contingencies that are 
beyond the control of the developer including but not limited to: 
external approvals, economic factors, market access, political factors 
and <b>social license</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development Unclarified 
are contingencies that have not been clearly defined; the project is 
currently under active evaluation; significant further appraisal may be 
required; progress is expected in a reasonable time period; chance of 
development is difficult to assess and could be a big range (20%-80%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development Not Viable 
are contingencies that have been identified; the project was evaluated 
and considered not viable or significant further appraisal may be 
required; progress is not expected in a reasonable time period and; has a
 low chance of development (&lt;&lt;50%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources 
--Development Pending and --Development On Hold are considered economic,
 Contingent Resources --Development Unclarified have economics that are 
undetermined, and Contingent Resources --Development Not Viable are 
considered sub-economic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective Resources are
 those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application 
of future development projects. Prospective resources have both an 
associated chance of discovery and a chance of development. Prospective 
Resources are further subdivided in accordance with the level of 
certainty associated with recoverable estimates assuming their discovery
 and development and may be sub classified based on project maturity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all exploration 
projects will result in discoveries. The chance that an exploration 
project will result in the discovery of petroleum is referred to as the 
"chance of discovery." Thus, for an undiscovered accumulation, the 
chance of commerciality is the product of two risk components -- the 
chance of discovery and the chance of development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estimates of resources 
always involve uncertainty, and the degree of uncertainty can vary 
widely between accumulations/projects and over the life of a project. 
Consequently, estimates of resources should generally be quoted as a 
range according to the level of confidence associated with the 
estimates. An understanding of statistical concepts and terminology is 
essential to understanding the confidence associated with resources 
definitions and categories. These concepts, which apply to all 
categories of resources, are outlined below. The range of uncertainty of
 estimated recoverable volumes may be represented by either 
deterministic scenarios or by a probability distribution. Resources 
should be provided as low, best, and high estimates as follows: </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">   -- Low Estimate and/or 1C in the case of Contingent Resources: This is 
      considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity that will 
      actually be recovered. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities 
      recovered will exceed the low estimate. If probabilistic methods are used, 
      there should be at least a 90 percent probability (P90) that the 
      quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the low estimate. 
 
   -- Best Estimate and/or 2C in the case of Contingent Resources: This is 
      considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will actually be 
      recovered. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities 
      recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate. If 
      probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50 percent 
      probability (P50) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or 
      exceed the best estimate. 
 
   -- High Estimate and/or 3C in the case of Contingent Resources: This is 
      considered to be an optimistic estimate of the quantity that will 
      actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual remaining 
      quantities recovered will exceed the high estimate. If probabilistic 
      methods are used, there should be at least a 10 percent probability (P10) 
      that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the high 
      estimate. </pre>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This approach to 
describing uncertainty may be applied to reserves, contingent resources,
 and prospective resources. There may be significant risk that sub 
commercial and undiscovered accumulations will not achieve commercial 
production, however, it is useful to consider and identify the range of 
potentially recoverable quantities independently of such risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main contingencies 
identified in the Lachowice Reserves Report are the successful 
recompletion of existing abandoned wells, the expected decline rates and

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This press release 
contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information 
(collectively "forward-looking information") within the meaning of 
applicable securities laws relating to the Company's plans and other 
aspects of our anticipated future operations, management focus, 
strategies, financial, operating and production results, industry 
conditions, commodity prices and business opportunities. In addition, 
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this press release
 contains forward-looking information regarding anticipated netbacks, 
anticipated potential of the Acquisition, the closing and timing of the 
Acquisition, the timing of the remaining regulatory approvals to close 
the Acquisition, the closing and timing of closing of the Financing, the
 use of proceeds from the Financing, decisions regarding additional 
listings, production guidance, capital program and allocation thereof, 
future production, development and drilling plans, well economics, 
future cost reductions, potential growth, the extension of the Ledeuix 
licence and the current operating plans with respect to the Company's 
assets in Franceas well as the source of funding the Company's capital 
spending. Forward-looking information typically uses words such as 
"anticipate", "believe", "project", "expect", "goal", "plan", "intend" 
or similar words suggesting future outcomes, statements that actions, 
events or conditions "may", "would", "could" or "will" be taken or occur
 in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The forward-looking 
information is based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by
 Horizon's management, including expectations and assumptions noted 
previously in this press release under oil and gas advisories, and in 
addition with respect to prevailing commodity prices and differentials, 
exchange rates, interest rates, applicable royalty rates and tax laws; 
future production rates and estimates of operating costs; performance of
 future wells; reserve and resource volumes; anticipated timing and 
results of capital expenditures; the success obtained in drilling new 
wells; the sufficiency of budgeted capital expenditures in carrying out 
planned activities; the timing, location and extent of future drilling 
operations; the state of the economy and the exploration and production 
business; results of operations; performance; business prospects and 
opportunities; the availability and cost of financing, labour and 
services; the impact of increasing competition; the ability to 
efficiently integrate assets and employees acquired through 
acquisitions, including the Acquisition, the ability to market natural 
gas successfully and Horizon's ability to access capital. Although the 
Company believes that the expectations and assumptions on which such 
forward-looking information is based are reasonable, undue reliance 
should not be placed on the forward-looking information because Horizon 
can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct. Since 
forward-looking information addresses future events and conditions, by 
its very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Horizon's
 actual results, performance or achievement could differ materially from
 those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking information and,
 accordingly, no assurance can be given that any of the events 
anticipated by the forward-looking information will transpire or occur, 
or if any of them do so, what benefits that we will derive therefrom. 
Management has included the above summary of assumptions and risks 
related to forward-looking information provided in this press release in
 order to provide securityholders with a more complete perspective on 
future operations and such information may not be appropriate for other 
purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Readers are cautioned 
that the foregoing lists of factors are not exhaustive. These 
forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this press release
 and we disclaim any intent or obligation to update publicly any 
forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, 
future events or results or otherwise, other than as required by 
applicable securities laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This press release 
contains future-oriented financial information and financial outlook 
information (collectively, "FOFI") about Horizon's prospective results 
of operations, operating netbacks and components thereof, all of which 
are subject to the same assumptions, risk factors, limitations and 
qualifications as set forth in the above paragraphs. FOFI contained in 
this press release was made as of the date of this press release and was
 provided for the purpose of providing further information about 
Horizon's anticipated future business operations. Readers are cautioned 
that the FOFI contained in this press release should not be used for 
purposes other than for which it is disclosed herein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Non-GAAP Measures</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This press release 
includes non-GAAP measures as further described herein. These non-GAAP 
measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by International 
Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS" or, alternatively, "GAAP") and 
therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures
 by other companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operating netbacks are 
determined by deducting royalties, net profit interest, production 
expenses and selling expenses from oil and gas revenue. Operating 
netbacks are per mcfe measures used in operational and capital 
allocation decisions. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre"> 
The assumptions used to generate the netback (US$/Mcfe) in this press release 
are as follows: 
Daily Production(1)                                 17.65 MMcfe/d 
Commodity Revenue (2)                                 US$4.57 MM 
Royalties and 6% NPI                                 US$ 0.57 MM 
Operating Cost(1)                                    US$ 0.28 MM

Operating Netbacks                                   US$6.82/Mcfe 
 
 
(1) Daily production and operating costs are management's best estimate of the 
production and operating costs from the anticipated wells and is based on all 
of the assumptions outlined in the above paragraphs; (2)Based on Lachowice 
Natural Gas Price = US$8.63/mcf, Condensate Price = US$72.00/Bbl, CAD/USD=

 ("Capstone" or the "Company") (TSX: CS) today announced the results of 
an updated National Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101") compliant Mineral 
Resource estimate for the Cozamin Mine in Zacatecas, Mexico (Table 1 
below). Compared to the <span class="companylink">Mineral Resources</span>
 as at December 31, 2017, this latest estimate converted or added an 
additional 115 thousand tonnes of copper in the Indicated category in 
the Mala Noche Footwall Zone ("MNFWZ"), reflecting all drilling for 
which assays have been received up to March 19, 2018. At a US$42 net 
smelter return ("NSR") cut-off grade ("COG"), the Cozamin Mine's total 
Measured and Indicated ("M&amp;I") copper <span class="companylink">Mineral Resources</span>, including adjustments for mining to March 31, 2018, were 217 thousand tonnes of contained copper (Table 3 below).</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We
 are extremely pleased with our recent drilling success in the MNFWZ at 
Cozamin," said Brad Mercer, Senior Vice President of Exploration at 
Capstone. "This new resource estimate, the culmination of over a year of
 intensive drilling, nearly triples the ore tonnes and doubles the 
contained copper in the MNFWZ M&amp;I classification."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We remain optimistic 
about the extension of operations at Cozamin well into the future," said
 Darren Pylot, President and CEO of Capstone. "The increasing copper 
resource creates the potential for a mine expansion and utilization of 
surplus mill capacity that is currently being partially filled using ore
 from the San Rafael zinc zone (Resource estimate in table 4 
below).&nbsp; The additional 115 thousand tonnes of contained copper 
added to the M&amp;I class in the MNFWZ will be targeted by mine 
engineering for potential conversion into mineral reserves in 2018, and 
Inferred resources will be targeted in 2018 and 2019 for a potential 
classification upgrade to M&amp;I (Table 2 below). All resources in 
Table 2 will provide the basis for a materials handling study, kicking 
off in mid-2018, to evaluate potential infrastructure needs to leverage 
upon our drilling success."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subsequent to this 
resource estimate a further 31 holes have been drilled in the MNFWZ and 
the zone remains open up dip and to the southeast, where we are 
continuing 40,000 metres of step-out and infill drilling this year on 
the Inferred class resource (Table 2 below), part of our US$7 million 
2018 exploration program. Further drilling is anticipated in 2019.</p>

estimate was completed using MineSightTM software using a 
three-dimensional block model (12 metre by 5 metre by 10 metre block 
size with 4 metre by 0.5 metre by 5 metre sub-blocks). The MNFWZ model 
is comprised of seven interpreted three-dimensional wireframes which 
were the primary estimation domain and hard boundaries were used to 
constrain the interpolation of grades into the block model. 
Interpolation parameters have been derived based on geostatistical 
analysis conducted on 1 metre composited drill hole. Block grades have 
been estimated using Ordinary Kriging (OK) methodology and the mineral 
resources have been classified based on proximity to sample data and the
 continuity of mineralization in accordance with CIM Definition 
Standards and Estimation Best Practices. The MNFWZ resource has been 
estimated using a total of 833 diamond drill holes with 2382 sample 
composites.</p>

this document certain forward-looking statements are identified by words
 including "optimistic", "targeted", "potential" and "possibility". By 
their very nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown 
risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual 
results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any
 future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the
 forward-looking statements. Such factors include, amongst others, risks
 related to actual results of current exploration activities, inherent 
hazards associated with mining operations, future prices of copper and 
other metals, compliance with financial covenants, surety bonding, our 
ability to raise capital, Capstone's ability to acquire properties for 
growth, counterparty risks associated with sales of our metals, use of 
financial derivative instruments and associated counterparty risks, 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes in general economic
 conditions, accuracy of mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates,
 operating in foreign jurisdictions with risk of changes to governmental
 regulation, compliance with governmental regulations, compliance with 
environmental laws and regulations, reliance on approvals, licences and 
permits from governmental authorities, impact of climatic conditions, 
aboriginal title claims and rights to consultation and accommodation, 
land reclamation and mine closure obligations, increased operating and 
capital costs, challenges to title to our mineral properties, 
maintaining ongoing <b>social license</b> to operate, dependence on key 
management personnel, potential conflicts of interest involving our 
directors and officers, corruption and bribery, limitations inherent in 
our insurance coverage, labour relations, increasing <b>energy</b> 
prices, competition in the mining industry, cybersecurity threats, legal
 proceedings and other risks of the mining industry as well as those 
factors detailed from time to time in the Company's interim and annual 
financial statements and management's discussion and analysis of those 
statements, all of which are filed and available for review under the 
Company's profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com[http://www.sedar.com/]. 
Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that 
could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ 
materially from those described in our forward-looking statements, there
 may be other factors that cause our results, performance or 
achievements not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There can 
be no assurance that our forward-looking statements will prove to be 
accurate, as our actual results, performance or achievements could 
differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. 
Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on our 
forward-looking statements.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This news release 
contains disclosure that has been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of Canadian securities laws, which differ from the 
requirements of US securities laws. Without limiting the foregoing, this
 news release may refer to technical reports that use the terms 
"indicated" and "inferred" resources. US investors are cautioned that, 
while such terms are recognized and required by Canadian securities 
laws, the SEC does not recognize them. Under US standards, 
mineralization may not be classified as a "reserve" unless the 
determination has been made that the mineralization could be 
economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve 
determination is made. US investors are cautioned not to assume that all
 or any part of indicated resources will ever be converted into 
reserves. US investors should also understand that "inferred resources" 
have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to 
whether they can be mined legally or economically. It cannot be assumed 
that all or any part of "inferred resources" will ever be upgraded to a 
higher category. Therefore, US investors are also cautioned not to 
assume that all or any part of inferred resources exist, or that they 
can be mined legally&nbsp;or economically. Accordingly, information 
concerning descriptions of mineralization and resources contained in 
this news release may not be comparable to information made public by US
 companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trudeau government's decision to spend $4.5 billion to acquire the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline must be a wake-up call for Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a sign that we've 
gone too far. Consultations and regulatory processes have become 
disconnected from their initial purposes of informed decision-making. 
Project approvals and permitting are regularly subjected to lengthy 
delays and costly uncertainty that have nothing to do with the 
environment, science, or our economic interests.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've enfeebled our economy as a result. The case of the Trans Mountain pipeline should bring this into stark clarity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A private company wanted 
to invest $7.5 billion - more than half the federal government's annual 
infrastructure budget - in our country's <b>energy</b> infrastructure. It represented a substantial investment involving 15,000 construction jobs alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company, by all accounts, followed the rules. It submitted a project application at the end of 2013. The <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span>
 recommended its approval in May 2016. The government accepted the 
recommendation - including 157 conditions - in November 2016. <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> spent $1 billion going through the painstaking consultation and regulatory process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet in spite of all 
this the company ultimately decided the project wasn't viable due to 
ongoing policy and legal uncertainty. No other firm would touch it. 
Ottawa had no choice but to buy it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How did we get to a point
 where a private company that abided by the process and sought to invest
 billions of dollars in our country was precluded from doing so? How did
 we get to a point where public capital needed to replace private 
capital to finance a profitable project? This isn't a nascent industry. 
It isn't a case of market failure. We already have 840,000 kilometres of
 pipeline operating in Canada. Most has been financed and constructed by
 private capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a case of 
government failure. In fact, it's a failure by all of us. We've 
permitted a build up of government rules and processes that amounts to 
what conservative columnist George Will calls "economic enfeeblement."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trudeau government 
certainly contributed to the problem. Opportunistic critiques of the 
major project review process diminished public confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vague commitments about 
the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People raised
 the spectre of a First Nations "veto". New regulatory burdens 
exacerbated the already slow and cumbersome process. Notions of "<b>social license</b>" were predictably used as a foil by ideological activists to stall progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is all true. But the
 problem is bigger than one government, one pipeline, or one sector. It 
now permeates every level of government and crosses the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One example: Condo and 
real estate developers in Toronto typically face nearly a 
year-and-a-half for approvals and spend an average of $46,570 per unit 
on compliance costs. The result is less housing supply and in turn 
higher prices at a time when people are rightly concerned about housing 
affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another example: federal,
 provincial, and local governments pledged funding for the Spadina 
subway extension in 2006 and yet the service only commenced more than 10
 years later in December 2017 following various delays and cost 
overruns. No wonder it represented the first new subway stops in 
decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The list could go on and on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trans Mountain episode is merely the most recent and highest profile example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It should cause us to 
restore common sense to government decision-making and project reviews. 
It's time to end the enfeeblement. We need to start building things 
again.</p>

 - To understand the counterintuitive political calculus behind Justin 
Trudeau's controversial decision to buy the Trans Mountain pipeline, one
 has to go back to the fundamental equation that has governed this prime
 minister's <b>energy</b> and climate change policies since his days in opposition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That Trudeau had no 
choice but to take over the pipeline if he wanted to ensure that the 
plan for its expansion did not die on the drawing board is not in 
question. By the time Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced the 
federal decision Tuesday, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> - the pipeline's parent company - was about to pull the plug on the project.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But
 the real question is why would the Liberal government be willing to put
 an open-ended amount of political and financial capital on the line to 
keep it alive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If one connects the dots 
between most major policies that past governments have deemed to be in 
the national interest, one almost always finds they conveniently 
intersected with a ruling party's election prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Stephen Harper's decision to bail out the auto industry in 2009 was not 
unrelated to the fact that his path to a coveted majority government ran
 through Ontario. His conversion to deficit financing at the time of the
 global economic crisis was a deathbed one, at least in part dictated by
 the need to survive confidence votes in the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by that measure, Trudeau's Trans Mountain move is an outlier. The electoral math does not add up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the face of it, the 
prime minister has at best shored up half a dozen Liberal seats in the 
Prairies at the cost of potentially putting in play at least triple that
 number across the country. Along the way, Trudeau has put himself on a 
collision course with many Indigenous constituencies, and he has 
destroyed his international reputation as a climate change crusader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the stakes, the 
prime minister's pipeline gamble has even been compared to Brian 
Mulroney's decision to roll the dice in his relentless quest for 
constitutional reconciliation with Quebec in the early 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mulroney had a 
compelling incentive to stick with the constitutional file to the bitter
 end. After the Meech Lake accord failed, he could not have let it go 
without risking his governing majority as the result of defections to 
the nascent Bloc Québécois and without fuelling support for Quebec 
secession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is an economic case
 to be made for ensuring the Trans Mountain pipeline is completed. Of 
the projects designed to link the Alberta oilfields to tidewater that 
were on the drawing board when Trudeau became prime minister, it is the 
only one that is still actively pursued. Until the last B.C. election, 
it was also considered the most likely to get to completion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Trans Mountain 
expansion has also become as politically indispensable to Trudeau's 
agenda - at least in the mind of its Liberal overseers - as it may be to
 Canada's oil industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was always meant to be the poster project for the federal contention that it is possible to balance Canada's <b>energy</b> ambitions with a more aggressive approach to mitigating climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Trudeau came to 
power, the emphasis has been the part of the equation that involves 
putting a price on carbon pollution as a necessary step to earn a <b>social license</b> for a pipeline projects such as Trans Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Liberal government believes the flipside of the equation - that a <b>social license</b> for a carbon tax cannot be sustained if it is earned on the back of Alberta's <b>energy</b> industry - to be just as essential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allowing the Trans 
Mountain expansion to die this week would have cost Trudeau the support 
of Alberta's NDP government for his national climate change framework. 
Back in March, Premier Rachel Notley tied meeting Ottawa's carbon tax 
targets to the future of the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking to next year's 
federal election, the demise of the Trans Mountain expansion would have 
meant giving opponents of Trudeau's carbon pricing strategy - starting 
with the federal Conservatives - a prime exhibit in their prosecution of
 the havoc they argue his policy will wreak on the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As so it is that while 
Trudeau is widely portrayed as having picked the polluters' side in the 
climate change debate, the Liberals will argue that they have done what 
they needed to do to continue to advance a pro-environment agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only time will tell 
whether this government has trapped itself in an intricate web of 
twisted logic. If so, as of this week's Trans Mountain announcement 
Trudeau is unlikely to untangle himself from that web in time for next 
year's election.</p>

for the pipeline rather than looking toward turning a profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As B.C. actively fights

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Ibbitson (The Globe 
and Mail) on all or nothing: “One of the boldest and riskiest qualities 
of the Trudeau government is its resolve, on certain key priorities, to 
decide first and worry about ‘how’ later. So marijuana use will become 
legal. Canada will have a carbon tax. The Trans Mountain pipeline will 
be built. If this approach works, at the end of their first term the 
Liberals will have earned a well-deserved reputation for decisiveness. 
If it doesn’t, they will be condemned for their recklessness. Events 
this week and next will foreshadow that verdict.”</p>

company will be willing to go near Trans Mountain when the fate of the

opponents believe they can stop the pipeline, its owner will be a

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal Liberals 
bought Trans Mountain to fulfill their commitment to get Alberta oil to 
the British Columbia coast after its Houston-based owner threw in the 
towel on plans to triple the pipeline’s capacity in the face of fierce 
political and public resistance, especially in B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government is already trying to find a willing buyer to take Trans Mountain off its hands. Investment bank <span class="companylink">Greenhill &amp; Co</span>.
 has been hired to pitch the project to everyone from pension-fund 
bosses to private-equity investors to pipeline companies. But the timing
 is off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No private company will 
be willing to go near Trans Mountain when the fate of the project 
remains in doubt. As long as environmentalists and other opponents 
believe they can stop the pipeline, its owner will be a political 
target. No chief executive wants to associate the corporate brand with 
scenes of pipeline protesters being led away in handcuffs, or deal with 
endless court challenges from B.C.’s NDP government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So for now, the pipeline 
can’t be flipped. The challenge for Ottawa − and Bay Street − is 
figuring out how much of the long-promised pipeline expansion must be 
built before the perceived risks begin to drop away and buyers step up 
with attractive offers. Opinions on this are all over the map.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The head of one 
investment bank, speaking anonymously because his firm desperately wants

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bankers are also working on plans to help Trans Mountain win an elusive <b>social license</b> by selling the project to a consortium of public sector pension plans with solid environmental credentials, including the <span class="companylink">British Columbia Investment Management Corp</span>. It’s worth noting that the country’s biggest fund, the <span class="companylink">Canada Pension Plan Investment Board</span>, said on Tuesday that it is “not actively assessing an investment in the extension opportunity.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That language is telling. The message from CPPIB is: We’re not interested now, but call us when the noise dies down.</p>

 did by partnering with the Fort McKay and Mikisew Cree First Nations on
 a recent $500-million investment in an Alberta oil storage facility. 
Canadian banks might be able to provide the financing to make those 
investments possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Infrastructure assets 
such as pipelines, and the dependable cash they kick off, are currently 
hot investments. If Mr. Trudeau can do as his grandfather did and build a
 business that supplies <b>energy</b> to customers who need 
ever-increasing amounts of fuel, Trans Mountain will have no shortage of
 buyers. But the government needs to reduce the risks before those 
investors emerge.</p>

is now. (Though, to be honest, I've not noticed any real change in my 
monthly power bill since getting the blessed bulbs, other than the 
notorious carbon charge.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certainly, there's been 
no change either among many in the rest of Canada, despite our 
self-imposed emissions cap and carbon levy. Yep, they're quietly 
continuing to enjoy the fruits of those extra taxes Alberta generates, 
while merrily complaining we're turning the planet into some big black 
blob.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there's the prime 
minister, who happily stuck a stake through Enbridge's planned 
$7.9-billion Northern Gateway pipeline to Kitimat in B.C., while 
allowing his government to disparage the <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span> and let a bunch of loudmouths, grandstanders and liars destroy <span class="companylink">TransCanada Corp</span>.'s $16-billion <b>Energy</b> East project aimed at shipping Alberta crude to New Brunswick refineries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just like Notley, he believed in this <b>social license</b>
 silliness. In Trudeau's case, he no doubt expected the Trans Mountain 
pipeline expansion to get a relatively easy passage as a type of payback
 for his government's success in screwing up the other national pipeline
 projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As we all now know, it didn't quite work out that way. So now the federal government is on bended knee to <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>,
 promising no doubt some huge taxpayer-funded payoff if the company 
agrees to continue putting up with the relentless sticks and stones of 
protest in B.C. and actually completes the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if they pull out as 
they have threatened to do at the end of this month? Well, according to 
federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau, there are other outfits that 
could step in to finish the job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, pray tell, who could they be? Maybe Morneau is thinking of those experienced Canadian pipeline builders. Yes, <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> and Enbridge - the same ones the Grits skewered a year or so ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And what would their 
reaction be, we wonder? Hold on a moment, folks. Can anyone else hear a 
strange, almost maniacal laughter emanating from those downtown Calgary 
office towers? Chris Nelson is a Calgary writer.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY, Alberta, May 11, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <span class="companylink">Questerre <b>Energy</b> Corporation</span>
 (“Questerre” or the “Company”) (TSX:QEC) (OSE:QEC) reported today on 
its financial and operating results for the first quarter ended March 
31, 2018.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, President and Chief Executive Officer of Questerre, 
commented, “Our production and cash flow growth this quarter was 
primarily driven by the increased investment in Kakwa. Production from 
the joint venture acreage almost doubled from the first quarter of 2017.
 With additional drilling scheduled for later this summer at Kakwa, we 
could see production dip in the next few quarters before a further 
increase by year-end.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, “Through a 
recent partnership with an experienced Montney operator, we plan to 
develop our immediately offsetting acreage. We are looking forward to 
the results from the first well given the strong condensate rates and 
low acid gas from our adjacent producing wells.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Highlights</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Average daily production over 2,000 boe/d for the quarter</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Adjusted funds flow from operations more than doubled to $4.7 million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Questerre partners with experienced operator to develop Kakwa North acreage</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Questerre commissions 
integration study for Jordan oil shale project Commenting on Quebec, he 
noted, “We were encouraged by comments this May from the Minister of 
Environment noting that the Minister of <b>Energy</b> and Natural 
Resources will soon be tabling regulations for hydrocarbons. Once 
finalized, we will be meeting with the municipalities to secure the 
local acceptability we need. We are confident there is interest in our 
clean gas pilot and its environmental and economic benefits.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Updating developments on its project in Jordan, he further added, “During the quarter, we engaged <span class="companylink">Hatch Ltd</span>.,
 a global engineering firm, to review the engineering and economics for 
our oil shale project in Jordan. The initial project will target 
production of approximately 50,000 bbls/d and will include the costs to 
upgrade the produced oil to diesel and gasoline. Once this study is 
completed, we plan to commission a more detailed pre-FEED study as we 
commence negotiations for a concession agreement.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result of the 
increased capital investment in Kakwa last year, the Company reported 
higher production volumes over prior periods. Production averaged 2,013 
boe/d for the quarter compared to 1,123 boe/d for the same period last 
year with Kakwa accounting for over three quarters of production during 
both periods. Gross revenue more than doubled to $9.54 million with 
higher production volumes benefitting from higher oil prices in the 
period. The higher revenue contributed to adjusted funds flow from 
operations of $4.65 million for the period compared to $1.41 million 
last year. The Company reported net income of $0.06 million for the 
current quarter compared to a loss of $0.52 million for the first 
quarter last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capital investment for 
the quarter focused almost exclusively on Kakwa and totaled $8.66 
million (2017: $5.32 million). The Company anticipates incremental 
investment at Kakwa in 2018 could be up to $21 million and include six 
(1.5 net) wells subject to the operator’s final plans and continued 
results.</p>

flow from operations" is a non-IFRS measure. Please see the

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This news release 
contains certain statements which constitute forward-looking statements 
or information (“forward-looking statements”) including the expectation 
that additional drilling will be scheduled at Kakwa this summer, the 
expectations for a further increase in production by year-end, the 
Company’s plans to develop its offsetting acreage at Kakwa through its 
partnership with an experienced Montney operator, the expectation that 
the first well could spud by June, the expectation that the final oil 
and gas regulations in Quebec will be issued soon, the Company’s plan to
 meet with municipalities in Quebec to secure the local acceptability 
needed, the Company’s belief that there is interest in its clean gas 
pilot by the municipalities in Quebec, the Company’s plans to commission
 a more detailed pre-FEED study for its oil shale project in Jordan, its
 plans to commence negotiations for a concession agreement, and its 
plans for additional capital spending at Kakwa. Although Questerre 
believes that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barrel of oil equivalent 
(“boe”) amounts may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A 
boe conversion ratio has been calculated using a conversion rate of six 
thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil and the 
conversion ratio of one barrel to six thousand cubic feet is based on an
 <b>energy</b> equivalent conversion method application at the burner 
tip and does not necessarily represent an economic value equivalent at 
the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of 
crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the
 <b>energy</b> equivalent of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This press release 
contains the terms “adjusted funds flow from operations” and “working 
capital surplus” which are non-GAAP terms. Questerre uses these measures
 to help evaluate its performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As an indicator of 
Questerre’s performance, adjusted funds flow from operations should not 
be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, cash flows 
from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. 
Questerre’s determination of adjusted funds flow from operations may not
 be comparable to that reported by other companies. Questerre considers 
adjusted funds flow from operations to be a key measure as it 
demonstrates the Company’s ability to generate the cash necessary to 
fund operations and support activities related to its major assets.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As
 a Canadian visiting Ottawa - in a nod to our selfie-friendly Prime 
Minister - have you ever taken a photo on Parliament Hill at the 
Centennial Flame? For shame. You might have missed the opportunity. The 
federal government has now taken its fine-toothed climate comb to that 
Centennial Flame by studying options to cut the natural gas and 
extinguish the flame to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. In the 
meantime, Ottawa is spending $20,000 tax dollars every year to purchase 
carbon offsets for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a bit silly. As the 
developing world is dramatically ramping up its demand for fossil fuels 
thanks to undeniably positive progress, Canada is looking at ways to 
turn a small flame into a LED light bulb.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's
 the latest move in the federal government's fourpronged climate plan: 
first, collect and spend more money; second, make life less enjoyable 
for Canadians; third, ensure politicians like Justin Trudeau and 
activists like David Suzuki carry on their carbon-intensive lifestyles; 
and fourth, look mildly ridiculous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If our politicians want 
to give the illusion that they're saving the planet with symbolic 
gestures, how about starting with themselves? Stop taking international 
flights to meetings discussing why people should take fewer 
international flights. Perhaps Face-Time the Aga Khan instead of flying 
all the way to his private island. Live a little less high on the hog. 
But their hypocrisy knows no bounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At present, Prime 
Minister Trudeau is still flying all over the world for luxury 
vacations. Minister of Environment and Climate Change Catherine McKenna 
tweets often about jetting off to climate meetings with groups of people
 who have evidently never heard of Skype. Carbon taxing premiers and 
provincial ministers are no better. And how many homes does Suzuki own? 
Politicians and bureaucrats are shuttled around using a lot of <b>energy</b>.
 Those trips are taxpayer-funded, so regular Canadians foot the bill 
twice - once on their own travel costs and again for the increased 
travel costs of the government class.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To what end? Those who 
supported Justin Trudeau's carbon tax schemes, hoping for tangible 
returns - via the intangible so-called <b>social license</b> - must 
surely be frustrated with the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain Pipeline 
expansion. The project got a technical go-ahead from the federal 
government a year and a half ago, yet is at a total stand-still. It 
failed to win <b>social license</b> with British Columbia gatekeepers, 
despite Albertans swallowing the carbon tax for nearly 18 months and the
 Trudeau government promising to punish all Canadians with the same tax 
grab.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Social license</b> has
 always been a false bill of goods, but it convinced some in the oil and
 gas industry that they first must be punished to achieve progress. 
(How's that working out?) Thankfully, fewer Canadians will be forced to 
stomach this political hypocrisy as the provincial defense against 
Trudeau's $35-billion annual carbon tax is mounting. Saskatchewan is 
taking the federal government to court and Manitoba's premier says he'll
 do the same, Atlantic provinces are not moving closer to carbon taxes, 
and polls show anti-carbon tax political leaders are likely to win the 
next elections in Ontario and Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign demand for fossil
 fuels makes carbon dioxide taxes here essentially pointless - unless 
you agree shipping jobs to China is a good way to lower Canada's CO2 
emissions. But if our politicians are so convinced that changing 
Canadian behaviour is the key to saving the world, the least they could 
do is lead by example. Until they do, their scolding will be 
hypocritical and their gestures will be silly at best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the day comes when the
 carbon tax is imposed on all Canadians by a heavyhanded federal 
government, take heart: together, we can gather 'round the Centennial 
LED, partaking collectively in one very long eye roll - or to ensure we 
keep warm, perhaps a louder political protest.</p>

 (the “Company” or “Wealth”) - (TSXV:WML) (OTCQB:WMLLF) (SSE:WMLCL) 
(Frankfurt:EJZN), provides a Trinity Project (the “Project”) update. The
 Company is finalizing a drill contract and expects to begin drilling 
before the end of May 2018. Drilling will consist of three drill holes 
to test priority drill targets identified during Transient 
Electromagnetic (“TEM”) surveys.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Wealth
 holds the largest portfolio of lithium brine projects in Chile and our 
recently announced partnership with ENAMI has paved the way for 
development of those projects. With this critical partnership, the 
Company has shifted priorities from accumulation of projects to 
systematic technical evaluation to determine which projects will be 
prioritized moving forward, especially now with the ENAMI alliance that 
allows both Companies to move the projects forward quickly. Henk van 
Alphen, Wealth Minerals’ CEO, stated: “The worldwide demand for 
inexpensive and accessible lithium is on the verge of a dramatic spike 
with the continued implementation of new transportation and 
communication technologies and an ever-increasing demand for <b>energy</b>-storage
 solutions. Wealth’s project portfolio is poised to become an 
increasingly important factor in the global lithium industry, and we 
have a visionary strategy for bringing this essential commodity to 
market.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Drill testing of targets
 at Trinity is an important step in a process that will see several 
projects evaluated by the end of H1 2018.” Mr. van Alphen continued, 
“The Company is planning an initial program of three holes to test 
highly conductive zones interpreted to represent potential near-surface 
lithium brines.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drilling Program</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company completed TEM
 surveys (see previous news release, January 28, 2018) on the Trinity 
Project. TEM surveys identified highly conductive zones, which are 
interpreted to represent porous media with high-salinity fluids 
(potentially lithium-bearing brines) at depth. Multiple anomalies are 
identified within the survey area with several drill targets southwest 
of the surface brine area. These targets represent the highest priority 
for exploration as they have the highest tenor conductivity (lower 
resistivity) suggesting greater saturation and/or higher salinity 
(Figure 1, 2 and 3).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drilling program is 
scheduled to drill three holes using a sonic drill rig to a depth of 
400m each, collecting brine samples at 50m intervals. Management expects
 the drill rig to be at site by the end of May and to have completed the
 drill program by June.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Quisquiro property, 
part of the Company’s Trinity Project, has been designated by the 
Chilean Government as one of the top 15 potential lithium producers in 
the country, and an additional independent analysis has given the 
property the highest possible ‘Tier One’ designation, strongly 
suggesting expected lithium-brine concentrations found to range from 423

projects in Chile, South America. To date, the Company has positioned 
itself to develop the Laguna Verde and Trinity projects as well as to 
work alongside existing producers in the prolific Atacama where we are 
developing our 46,000 hectares land right. The Company aims to bring a 
reliable source of ethically produced lithium to market in close 
cooperation with government agencies and local stakeholders. Lithium 
market dynamics and a rapidly increasing metal price are the result of 
profound structural issues with the industry meeting anticipated future

<span class="companylink">HTC PURENERGY INC</span>. (DBA HTC PURENERGY) ANNOUNCES FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2017</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">HTC Purenergy Inc</span>. has released its audited financial results for the fiscal year ending Dec. 31, 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HTC Purenergy and its 
subsidiaries has chosen to refocus its business units in the 
Environmental Technologies Sector. The acceptance of climate change and 
the <b>social license</b> that corporations are moving towards, are upon
 us in force. Carbon footprint and the capture and management of CO2 has
 become effectively a currency of business, a vehicle for penalty and 
taxation, and a statement to shareholders who expect environmental 
responsibility from the companies they invest in. We note as well, that 
all segments of the <b>energy</b> sector must contribute and as such, 
the management of CO2 from combustion-fired plants, can be used not only
 to reduce emissions, but also to improve oil production, through the 
use of enhanced oil recovery ("EOR") techniques. HTC has focused its 
efforts in this area over the past few years, as EOR provides an 
immediate economic benefit to an oil company, in addition to being able 
to meet its <b>social license</b> responsibilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The natural gas industry 
has taken on a new challenge of gas cleanup of CO2, SO2 and other 
contaminants, while ensuring that the solvents and the glycols that are 
used in the clean-up process are recycled and reused, while at the same 
time providing a significant cost reduction to the customer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HTC's Delta Purification 
Division and HTC's investment in Clear Glycol &amp; Solvents Inc. are 
showing promising results, as the <b>energy</b> industry and many larger Industrial companies have joined the re3 revolution: reclaim, recycle, reuse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tertiary oil 
production business requires a significant amount of water for 
production of steam and at the same time a significant capital cost to 
install traditional heavy oil production technologies. The Assist <b>Energy</b>
 Solutions Corp.'s "SCV" technology allows the use of brackish 
production water, that normal ly would have to be disposed of or 
treated, to be used as steam for <b>energy</b> production. The SCV 
technology also allows the heavy oil producer to bring existing 
non-producing wells back online, with a minimal investment in capital 
costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Reclaim, Recycle, Reuse"
 is more than a tag line for our company, WE ARE WORLD LEADERS 
delivering technology in this solvent and glycol sector.</p>

*December 31, 2016 amounts have been restated to the current basis presentation arising from the

("Pinnacle") and Clear Glycol &amp; Solvents Inc.("ClearGSI").
</pre>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total assets for the 
Period were $27,222,061 compared to $29,839,303 as at December 31, 2016.
 The primary reasons for the change is attributable to ClearGSI 
conversion from consolidation to equity accounting, and the substantial 
increase in property, plant and equipment associated with the 
development of grain and fertilizer handling facility projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Current liabilities were 
$1,584,236 for the Year as compared to $3,142,192 as at Dec. 31, 2016. 
Decrease of $1,557,956 is largely due to the reduction in overall debt 
as a result of the disposition of Pinnacle and reduced ownership in 
ClearGSI requiring equity accounting in 2017. The decrease is also due 
to the making of regular repayments on the current portion of finance 
leases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenues for the Year of 
$269,493 reflect an increase of $207,188 from Dec. 31, 2016, due to an 
increase in sales that came from HTC's subsidiary Maxx Group of 
Companies Corp. and its subsidiaries (together "Maxx Group") of 
$102,570, $66,923 comes from HTC CO2 Systems Corp. (December 31, 2016 
$30,859) and $100,000 (December 31, 2016 - $31,446) came from 
engineering and process design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Corporation had a 
commercial operating loss at December 31, 2017 of ($4,339,892) as 
compared to ($3,892,106) for the period ending December 31, 2016 for a 
net change of $447,786. The change between December 31, 2017 and 
December 31, 2016 was due to an increase in financing costs arising on 
allocation to funds on receivables due over the next few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Costs of sales reflect 
manufacturing and sales costs associated with Maxx Group. The increase 
is a result of the costs associated with inventory sales. Engineering 
and process design services include costs associated with the provision 
of consulting services. There were $100,000 costs in engineering 
projects during the Period, (2016 - $31,446). These costs resulted from 
sales reported in quarter two. There is no three-month comparison for 
this period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amortization for the 
Period reported was $370,793 (December 31, 2016 $368,124). Amortization 
in the periods are comparable with the slight increase in amortization 
relating to capital purchases. Amortization relating to buildings have 
not begun as the grain and fertilizer handling projects are still in the
 development phase. Operations are expected to commence in 2018 subject 
to project completion, at which time amortization will commence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finance expenses realized
 during the Period was $425,610 (December 31, 2016 - $14,735). The 
increase is a result of computations of interest charges on amounts 
receivable over the next few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deferred tax recovery of $1,359,877 results in tax associated with the renegotiation of the terms of the sale of <span class="companylink">Nuvision</span> resulting in recognition of the gains the year and eliminate contingent amounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Net Income for the Period
 was $2,372,965 compared to income of $3,773,662 as at December 31, 2016
 (see table above). The decrease is primarily due to fewer gains on 
dispositions realized in 2017 versus 2016. Comprehensive income (loss) 
includes the unrealized gains and losses on investments classified as 
available for sale of $(250,408) (December 31, 2016 $227,745) and 
represents the net change in the carrying value of the investments to 
the quoted value and transfer of impaired investments to the 
Consolidated Statement of Loss. These adjustments do not involve cash. 
Comprehensive Income for the Period is $2,122,557 compared to income of 
$4,001,407 as at December 31, 2016. The decrease is attributable to net 
income and the change in unrealized gain on investments classified as 
available for sale.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps
 easy to miss amid the understandable political uproar over Canadian 
pipelines (or perhaps more appropriately, our apparent inability to 
build them) was the <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span> Monthly Merchandise Trade Report in February that tracks Canada's international balance of trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report indicated 
Canada's trade deficit amounted to $2.7 billion, which widened from $1.9
 billion from the prior month, with imports advancing 1.9 per cent 
month-over-month, mostly due to higher purchases of <b>energy</b> products.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hidden within those summary numbers was the revelation that imports of <b>energy</b>
 products into Canada advanced by a material 15.4 per cent to $3.4 
billion, the highest level since November 2014, with the largest share 
of those imports originating from the U.S. The importation of crude oil 
and bitumen advanced 15.4 per cent, with imported refined petroleum 
products up by 24.1 per cent, the latter due largely to increased 
imports of gasoline into British Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's increased importation of oil and its products reflects a growing trend in the past two years. In December 2015, the <span class="companylink">U.S. Congress</span> ended a 40-year ban on oil exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accompanied by surging 
U.S. production, crude oil exports from the U.S. to Canada (seasonally 
adjusted), have risen from $6.4 billion from September 2015 to February 
2016, to $8.4 billion from September 2017 to February of this year, or 
by about a third.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While these numbers fluctuate monthly, the point is that in February, while Canada exported $8.8 billion in <b>energy</b>, it also imported $3.38 billion from international sources which, according to <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span>, represents a year-to-year increase of 12.3 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada produces far more 
oil than it can consume, and hence it is the world's fourth largest 
producer and third largest exporter of oil. In 2016, Canada was the 
largest foreign supplier of crude oil to the U.S., with 99 per cent of 
our oil exports directed there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada accounted for 41 per cent of total U.S. crude oil imports and 20 per cent of U.S. refinery crude oil intake. However, <span class="companylink">Natural Resources Canada</span>
 also indicated that in 2016, Canada imported crude oil and equivalents 
from many countries, including the United States (62 per cent), Saudi 
Arabia, Algeria, Nigeria and Norway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when Canadian 
attentions, both public and political, are riveted on our pernicious 
lack of pipeline access to international oil markets, we question why so
 little attention is being paid to Canada's increasing importation of 
petroleum products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It cost Canadians $3.4 
billion in February alone. To be clear, we are not arguing that a trade 
surplus or deficit is an appropriate barometer of a country's health. 
However, we do suggest that growing U.S. exports, due to deregulation, 
and our inability to build infrastructure to export our <b>energy</b>, is not beneficial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada could enhance its 
security of supply, reduce its trade deficit and produce fewer global 
greenhouse gas emissions if we used more of our Canadian crude oil 
production. A recent study by the <span class="companylink">Canadian <b>Energy</b> Research Institute</span>,
 using 2016 data, indicates that substituting Canadian oil wherever 
possible using space on existing pipelines, railcars and ocean tankers, 
could reduce foreign oil imports into Eastern Canada by a whopping 47 
per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This would save 
refineries $210 million and reduce Canadian emissions of carbon dioxide 
by the equivalent of more than two million tonnes, or about 5.7 per cent
 annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute also found 
that eastern Canadian refineries process just over one million barrels 
of oil per day, of which only 39 per cent originates from Western Canada
 and five per cent originates from the eastern Canadian offshore; fully 
56 per cent is imported from the United States (amounting to 260,000 
barrels of imported oil per day).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly, lower regulatory
 and fiscal costs would benefit all Canadians. Hence, we urgently need 
better policies to resolve our pipeline infrastructure problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a precarious B.C. 
government opposes oil pipelines, the Trudeau government's avowed 
transition away from fossil fuels appears to be directed solely at 
penalizing Canadian producers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is over-regulating
 domestic producers with misdirected policies that allow foreign 
petroleum imports - unimpeded by Canadian environmental laws, so-called <b>social license</b>,
 greenhouse gas reduction strategies and associated taxes - to flood 
into Canada to displace jobs and discourage investment. Ron Wallace has 
served on federal, provincial and territorial <b>energy</b> and 
environmental regulators and advisory boards. Jack Mintz is the 
president's fellow at the University of Calgary's School of Public 
Policy.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peace
 River-Westlock MP Arnold Viersen emphasized the need for more pipelines
 in the region, including around the Whitecourt area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pipelines are currently at maximum capacity in Alberta.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Pipelines
 are integral to the Canadian economy, but especially northern Alberta,"
 Viersen said. "Most of the petroleum products from Alberta are produced
 in northern Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It affects us immensely."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Viersen, 
alternatives for oil transportation such as railways should be ruled out
 due to the increased danger and inefficiency. Using railways also takes
 up space that could be used for other products, such as grain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's just very expensive
 to ship oil by other processes other than by pipelines," Viersen said. 
"When we already have a discounted oil price, to then have to put that 
extra cost on it just makes it a nonstarter for oil companies."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Viersen explained that less exploration leads to less people in the area, which negatively affects the local economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He noted that the region had a high of 1,800 drilling rigs in 2013, but now has only around half that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Just that alone means there's thousands of people not working," Viersen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> recently announced it 
would suspend work on the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion after 
pushback from British Columbia and environmental activists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Since Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has taken power, we've seen Northern Gateway get cancelled, we've seen the <b>Energy</b>
 East project get cancelled as well, and now we're look at Trans 
Mountain, which is probably the last major pipeline project that was in 
the cue," Viersen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also noted how the carbon tax was supposed to give Alberta "<b>social license</b>" for the building of more pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've been underneath 
the weight of a significant carbon tax before many of the other 
provinces and it doesn't seem to be helping," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Viersen said 
conservatives, including himself, are now calling on Trudeau to take 
action and convince the opposition to allow more pipeline projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's his job to convince
 these folks that these projects are in the national interest," Viersen 
said. "Coming from Alberta, all of us live on top of pipelines-steel 
pipelines-every day. We know the safety of them."</p>

 pipeline. And guess what? They say it's highly unlikely their court 
challenge will get a decision before the May 31st deadline, which is the
 deadline <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> has set to pull
 the plug on the pipeline. Coincidence? Not sure. The federal government
 still insists though that the pipeline will get built. The question is 
how will they do it? But here's the twist. They now have a summer jobs 
program, and the federal government will be providing an environmental 
group with money that will be used to stop the Trans Mountain pipeline 
from ever getting built. Is this just a case of free speech, or is it a 
sign that the federal government isn't really behind this project at 
all? Joining me now to talk about that and more, the Conservative leader
 Andrew Scheer. Good to have you here, sir.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
ANDREW SCHEER (Conservative Leader): Great to be on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: What do you 
think of, if you were the federal government, if you're the prime 
minister right now, what would you do? What would the response be to 
BC's reference to their superior court? SCHEER: Well if I could just put
 this in context a little bit, because we have to understand why the May
 31st deadline is so important. It's important because the confidence in
 our <b>energy</b> sector has been shattered. The ban on tanker traffic, killing Northern Gateway, the Liberals killed <b>Energy</b>
 East, the carbon tax, now bill C-69. So the government needed to not do
 things months ago. We called on Justin Trudeau to meet with Premier 
Horgan in January and February. They only met a couple of weeks ago. So 
they've been so late to this game. We need a federal government that's 
going to stand up for federal jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: How though? 
SCHEER: Well there are tools at the government's disposal to ensure that
 this project can get built by declaring it in the national interest, by
 ensuring that other aspects around the pipeline cannot be used...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Okay, one of the
 big things is, and Jason Kenney has talking about this, stop transfers 
to BC to force their hand. Would you support that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: I think when 
we're talking about levels of action like that, we're kind of losing the
 big picture, which is that we shouldn't have a government that has to 
punish the people of a province because they failed to take leadership 
for months. When you look at why <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 is saying this, they're not saying this because there is something 
magic happens on May 31st. They're saying this because there's no signal
 that this federal government is going to champion...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: But how do they give signal?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: Repeal C-69, scrap the carbon tax, lift the tanker ban which would allow Northern Gateway to be built, invite <b>Energy</b>
 East back to the table. That would all send confidence to say, okay, we
 may have an issue with the premier... SOLOMON: But how would that, but 
how would stopping a price on carbon in anyway do anything for a 
pipeline?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: Because right now
 what's happening is people around the world understand that under 
Justin Trudeau there will not be new pipelines built, that there will 
not be new big <b>energy</b> projects built because of all these other 
things. If we had a federal government that was sending the signal that 
Canada was a place that you can do business in, then they would say, 
okay, we'll wait out the British Columbia court decision because we have
 all these other things that give us confidence that we can get a 
successful pipeline built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: To be fair, 
through, first of all linking the price on carbon, I do not see the link
 there, but let's just... SCHEER: It's a huge cost to the <b>energy</b> 
sector. It's another cost that makes them less effective, less 
competitive versus other countries. SOLOMON: Does it bother you that, 
because you campaigned against a price on carbon a lot, that BC which 
has had a price on carbon, Quebec now, Ontario, and Alberta, those have 
all been, I mean BC and Ontario, the fastest, and Quebec, the fastest 
growing economies. The price on carbon, in fact according to Eco Fiscal 
Commission, has not hurt those economies, it's helped those economies. 
Those are the fastest growing economies. In other words, the link 
between a price on carbon and hurting the economy is not there. What do 
you say to that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: Well I believe 
absolutely it has hurt Canadian families in those provinces. I don't 
support a carbon tax. I'll leave it up to voters in individual provinces
 to decide what they want their provincial government to do. I do not 
believe that the federal government should impose a carbon tax. I will 
repeal the Liberal carbon tax. SOLOMON: And people will say to you, all 
right Andrew Scheer, you don't like that, what will you do about climate
 change to reduce carbon? Anything? Do you have a plan?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: Well exactly. And
 the Liberals would love to have people believe that the choice is a 
carbon tax or nothing. I reject that. The previous Conservative 
government took real steps to lower emissions working with industry, 
finding way to incentivize efficiencies in terms of emitting into the 
atmosphere. The Liberals...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: You're not even 
close to reaching your own target to be fair. SCHEER: The Liberals 
signed on to the exact same targets that we had. We will be unveiling a 
very detailed and comprehensive plan, because we believe that Canada has
 to be part of the solution. We're about a year away from the next 
selection, a little bit more, I guarantee you we will have a 
comprehensive message to Canadians that doesn't just focus in on...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: That will reach,
 I'm just asking because you know this is a big issue, because it ties 
in with pipelines as you said, the former Harper regulations would not 
come close to meeting this, the targets that the Harper government set, 
and you want to keep those. Will you unveil a plan that will actually 
meet the Paris targets?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: Of course I will 
unveil a plan that reaches the targets that we have already voted in 
favour of. We believe that Canada has to be part of the solution. We 
want to have, we will, we will have a meaningful plan to reduce 
emissions and that will also tackle other major environmental issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Let's talk about
 the summer jobs program, been pretty controversial. The federal 
government has this plan where they say you can apply, you can get money
 to support an intern, but you have to, if you're a group that in anyway
 shape or form opposes pro choice and their views on reproduction, they 
have to have an attestation that you cannot use any of the money for 
that. Many religious groups say, no way, it's against our principles. 
Now we, so Bible camps in Alberta are not getting any money, they are 
not eligible. In the meantime, an advocacy group called Dogwood, which 
is specifically going to use the money to oppose the Trans Mountain 
pipeline, got the money. Is it hypocrisy, or is it something that you 
have defended, free speech?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: It's complete 
hypocrisy because it's not quite, as you led into it, the Liberal 
attestation was not required solely for groups that were involved in 
advocacy, it was obligatory for everybody. If you were trying to hire 
someone to work in a rural museum, they had to sign on to that 
attestation. A local municipality, the town administrator would have to 
sign that attestation. So what they were doing was forcing people to 
believe the same thing that Justin Trudeau believed to hire a summer 
student to do anything. Now here we have a situation where, in British 
Columbia, an organization is using the funding to specifically organize 
protests, to advocate, to block a project that is in the national 
interest. So this Liberal government is taking tax dollars from people 
who have lost their jobs in the <b>energy</b> sector and giving it to a group of people...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Do you think they shouldn't give it to Dogwood?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: I don't believe 
that, I believe that we need to have a look at this program and say why 
is the federal government funding advocacy groups? You know advocacy 
groups are free to raise money on their own. SOLOMON: Do you think they 
should fund religious groups? What's the difference? I'm just trying, my
 confusion on this is the Conservative government didn't want to fund 
groups like <span class="companylink">Planned Parenthood</span> because 
they used reproductive issues as a litmus test for funding, as the 
Liberals have, okay? So both Conservatives and Liberals have used this 
issue as a litmus test. Then, on the other side though, there is not a 
litmus test for other groups, and that's what I don't understand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: We've never 
argued the point that the government doesn't have the right to choose 
what types of activities are funded. We just said the government 
shouldn't force a view on your, peer inside your conscience and dictate 
what you should...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: But on reproductive issues, the Conservative government would pull funding, as had the Liberals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: We never forced people to take a position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: On maternal health you wouldn't fund groups like <span class="companylink">Planned Parenthood</span>. You know that. And by the way, the Conservatives funded Dogwood, right. The same group got money from the Conservatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: I'm not sure what
 that money went for. This grant went specifically to organizing 
protests. It literally says in there in black and white.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Do you think they should pull the money?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: I don't believe 
that groups that are using those funds to actively advocate protests, I 
don't know that we... SOLOMON: So are you saying, I thought you were a 
free speech guy. You campaigned on the free speech guy. Let people who 
disagree with talk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: Free speech is 
different than using government funds to advocate or to protest. The 
difference here is that we, in fact what the Liberals are doing is, 
they're taking away someone's right of free speech, or free thought, 
free opinion by pulling their funding if they don't share the same view.
 What we're saying is the government has the right to say these types of
 activities aren't funded. They don't have the right to impose their 
values or their beliefs on someone, and that's the difference here. It's
 a huge issue. I know the Liberals would love this to be characterized 
as a free speech issue. It's not. It's about them funding the very 
people that they say need to get grant permission. Justin Trudeau has 
invented the term of <b>social license</b> and empowering all these 
protestors, and then he goes out and gives them money to block the very 
thing that he's trying to get built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: I got to leave it there. Andrew Scheer, great to have you here, Sir.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: Always fun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: All right, 
coming up on this program. In the wake of the mass murder in Toronto, is
 it time for the government to redefine what qualifies as terrorism? MPs
 are joining us and we'll look at the darkest part of the internet where
 hatred for women is prevalent. That's next. Stay right here on

 is not just pipelines that Canada has a hard time getting done. Putting
 money where the country's mouth is on climate change is turning out to 
be at least as hard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, two provinces 
turned to the courts to challenge core elements of Prime Minister Justin
 Trudeau's plan to reconcile Canada's <b>energy</b> ambitions with its climate-change obligations.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As
 previously announced, the government of British Columbia is asking that
 province's top court to clarify whether it has the constitutional 
authority to regulate the amount of bitumen oil that transits through 
its territory. The answer will not be forthcoming for a while and 
certainly not in time for the May 31 deadline set by <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> to fish or cut bait on its expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A favourable court ruling
 for B.C. could have consequences for the profitability of all future 
interprovincial pipelines, starting with the Trans Mountain expansion. 
In the immediate future, the move by the province's minority NDP 
government means that project will likely not go ahead without an 
injection of public funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If he loses the court 
battle, Premier John Horgan says he will consider the pipeline matter 
closed. But that might only happen once the province has exhausted all 
its legal recourses. If the case makes its way to the Supreme Court, 
this debate could stretch beyond the next B.C. election. The government 
of Saskatchewan has also gone to its top court to challenge the federal 
government - Trudeau's plan to impose a carbon tax on provinces that 
fail to take steps to meet the carbon-pricing threshold set by Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ontario and Alberta, 
the Conservative opposition parties support Saskatchewan's move. If 
elected to power later this spring and next year, Doug Ford and Jason 
Kenney have both said they would fight Trudeau's carbon-pricing policy 
in court. Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is planning to campaign next
 year on a promise to repeal the Liberal climate-change framework.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all the drama 
surrounding the battle to stop the Trans Mountain project, the political
 forces aligning against Trudeau's climate-change strategy are no less 
consequential. They are also just as uncompromising in their stance as 
the anti-pipeline foes, whose intractable opposition to the Trans 
Mountain project they so vehemently denounce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he set out the terms 
of his province's carbon tax challenge on Wednesday, Saskatchewan 
Premier Scott Moe argued that provinces are not subsidiaries of the 
federal government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent Supreme Court 
beer ruling demonstrated that contention has a constitutional 
foundation. But the irony that Saskatchewan is invoking the same 
federalism principle to fight Trudeau's carbon tax as B.C. is in its 
challenge to the federally backed pipeline is apparently lost on Moe and
 his federal and provincial allies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau came to power touting a two-pronged approach to <b>energy</b>
 and climate change. His government would put in place a national 
framework for carbon pricing and make a start toward meeting Canada's 
international obligations to reduce greenhouse gases. But it would also 
have the back of the fossil fuel industry as it sought to expand its 
reach to markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two-and-a-half years 
later, few of the protagonists in the debate have bought into Trudeau's 
proposed compromise, they have sidestepped it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notwithstanding the prime
 minister's carbon-pricing initiatives, climate change activists in B.C.
 and elsewhere and their like-minded Indigenous allies are not about to 
give a <b>social license</b> to pipeline projects. Opposition to the 
Trans Mountain expansion is more deeply rooted in concerns over the 
increased risk of oil spills at sea than in the project's contribution 
to greenhouse-gas emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other side of the 
debate, the Conservative opposition to Trudeau's carbon-pricing policy 
is not tied to the obstacles standing in the way of the Trans Mountain 
expansion. If those obstacles were removed tomorrow, Scheer, Ford, 
Kenney and Moe would not blink an eye in their battle against a federal 
carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Trudeau, winning the 
pipeline battle would not translate into winning the carbon-pricing war.
 It would only impose on his government an even greater obligation to 
ensure its carbon-pricing plan is equally implemented. The prime 
minister has said he will see the Trans Mountain project done, even if 
that means forcing the hand of B.C.'s government and losing support in 
B.C. before next year's federal election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By all indications, 
Trudeau will have to show the same determination to ensure his national 
climate change framework becomes a reality in every province - again, at
 some potential risk to his party's electoral fortunes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps easy to miss amid
 the understandable political uproar over Canadian pipelines (or perhaps
 more appropriately, our apparent inability to build them) was the <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span> Monthly Merchandise Trade Report in February that tracks Canada's international balance of trade.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 report indicated Canada's trade deficit amounted to $2.7 billion, which
 widened from $1.9 billion from the prior month, with imports advancing 
1.9 per cent month-over-month, mostly due to higher purchases of <b>energy</b> products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hidden within those summary numbers was the revelation that imports of <b>energy</b>
 products into Canada advanced by a material 15.4 per cent to $3.4 
billion, the highest level since November 2014, with the largest share 
of those imports originating from the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The importation of crude 
oil and bitumen advanced 15.4 per cent, with imported refined petroleum 
products up by 24.1 per cent, the latter due largely to increased 
imports of gasoline into British Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's increased importation of oil and its products reflects a growing trend in the past two years. In December 2015, the <span class="companylink">U.S. Congress</span> ended a 40-year ban on oil exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accompanied by surging 
U.S. production, crude oil exports from the U.S. to Canada (seasonally 
adjusted), have risen from $6.4 billion from September 2015 to February 
2016, to $8.4 billion from September 2017 to February of this year, or 
by about a-third.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While these numbers fluctuate monthly, the point is that in February, while Canada exported $8.8 billion in <b>energy</b>, it also imported $3.38 billion from international sources which, according to <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span>, represents a year-to-year increase of 12.3 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada produces far more 
oil than it can consume, and hence it is the world's fourth largest 
producer and third largest exporter of oil. In 2016, Canada was the 
largest foreign supplier of crude oil to the U.S., with 99 per cent of 
our oil exports directed there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada accounted for 41 per cent of total U.S. crude oil imports and 20 per cent of U.S. refinery crude oil intake. However, <span class="companylink">Natural Resources Canada</span>
 also indicated that in 2016, Canada imported crude oil and equivalents 
from many countries, including the United States (62 per cent), Saudi 
Arabia, Algeria, Nigeria and Norway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when Canadian 
attentions, both public and political, are riveted on our pernicious 
lack of pipeline access to international oil markets, we question why so
 little attention is being paid to Canada's increasing importation of 
petroleum products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It cost Canadians $3.4 
billion in February alone. To be clear, we are not arguing that a trade 
surplus or deficit is an appropriate barometer of a country's health. 
However, we do suggest that growing U.S. exports, due to deregulation, 
and our inability to build infrastructure to export our <b>energy</b>, is not beneficial to Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada could enhance its 
security of supply, reduce its trade deficit and produce fewer global 
greenhouse gas emissions if we used more of our Canadian crude oil 
production. A recent study by the <span class="companylink">Canadian <b>Energy</b> Research Institute</span>,
 using 2016 data, indicates that substituting Canadian oil wherever 
possible using space on existing pipelines, railcars and ocean tankers, 
could reduce foreign oil imports into Eastern Canada by a whopping 47 
per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This would save 
refineries $210 million and reduce Canadian emissions of carbon dioxide 
by the equivalent of more than two million tonnes, or about 5.7 per cent
 annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute also found 
that eastern Canadian refineries process just over one million barrels 
of oil per day, of which only 39 per cent originates from Western Canada
 and five per cent originates from the eastern Canadian offshore; fully 
56 per cent is imported from the United States (amounting to 260,000 
barrels of imported oil per day).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly, lower regulatory
 and fiscal costs would benefit all Canadians through the more efficient
 utilization of Canadian resources. Hence, we urgently need better 
policies to resolve our pipeline infrastructure problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a precarious B.C. 
government opposes oil pipelines, the Trudeau government's avowed 
transition away from fossil fuels appears perversely to be directed 
solely at penalizing Canadian producers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is over-regulating
 domestic producers with misdirected policies that allow foreign 
petroleum imports - unimpeded by Canadian environmental laws, so-called <b>social license</b>, greenhouse gas reduction strategies and associated taxes - to flood into Canada to displace jobs and discourage investment.</p>

 Daily Times -- The Trans Mountain Expansion pipeline has dominated news
 in the past few weeks. The public is divided over whether we should 
build this pipeline and allow Alberta oil sands output to increase, or 
whether it presents too much risk to BC's rivers and coastal 
environments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many experts described 
the original project approval process as deeply flawed. The Liberals 
ignored their campaign promise of a new, improved process and instead 
sent a ministerial panel along the pipeline route in the summer of 2016.
 Many communities and First Nations governments criticized this process 
as inadequate as well. However the panel did write a report that ended 
with a list of six clear questions for the government to answer before 
making a decision.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think it would be useful to review those questions to see more clearly how we got into this quagmire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Can construction of a 
new Trans Mountain Pipeline be reconciled with Canada's climate change 
commitments? Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr often proclaims "This 
pipeline will be built", but I have never heard him say "We will meet 
our Paris targets." For many pipeline opponents this is the crux of the 
problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. In the absence of a comprehensive national <b>energy</b> strategy, how can policy-makers effectively assess projects such as the Trans Mountain Pipeline? Canada needs a national <b>energy</b>
 strategy that would answer broader questions such as: what role new 
pipelines would play in a world where world oil demand (according to the
 <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span> itself) 
will begin declining in 2019; how we might refine our oil resources for 
our own use rather than exporting bitumen and importing foreign oil on 
the Atlantic coast; and how we can create good jobs in renewable <b>energy</b> as the world shifts to a low carbon future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. How might Cabinet 
square approval of the Trans Mountain Pipeline with its commitment to 
reconciliation with First Nations and to the UNDRIP principles of "free,
 prior, and informed consent?" This is perhaps the key question that the
 federal government failed to answer before it approved the Trans 
Mountain Expansion. There is strong opposition to the project from many 
First Nations, and a number of lawsuits are in the courts arguing that 
the approval process did not involve proper consultation. If this is 
found to be the case (as it was in the Northern Gateway pipeline 
decision) it could delay the project another year or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. Given the changed 
economic and political circumstances, the perceived flaws in the NEB 
process, and also the criticism of the Ministerial Panel's own review, 
how can Canada be confident in its assessment of the project's economic 
rewards and risks? According to Nanos Research only 2% of Canadians have
 strong confidence in Canada's <b>energy</b> regulation system, a fact that bears on the discontent seen on both sides of this debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. If approved, what 
route would best serve aquifer, municipal, aquatic and marine safety? 
Kinder Morgan has not yet asked the government for approval of the exact
 route for much of the pipeline; in many cases the old route will not be
 followed, especially in the Lower Mainland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6. How does federal policy define the terms "<b>social license</b>"
 and "Canadian public interest" and their inter-relationships? Through 
the election campaign, Justin Trudeau repeated the mantra "governments 
can grant permits, but only communities grant permission". The federal 
government now finds itself in a very difficult situation, having to 
tell coastal British Columbians that the project is in the national 
interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is now too late to 
answer these questions before Kinder Morgan's self-imposed deadline of 
May 31, but we would have been in a much better situation had the 
government fully dealt with them before approving the Trans Mountain 
expansion project.</p>

("Sherritt" or the "Corporation") (TSX: S), a world leader in the mining
 and hydrometallurgical refining of nickel and cobalt from lateritic 
ores, today reported its financial results for the first quarter ended 
March 31, 2018. All amounts are in Canadian currency unless noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CEO COMMENTARY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sherritt's results for 
Q1 reflect the positive impact of improving commodity prices and our 
continuing efforts to strengthen our balance sheet," said David Pathe, 
President and CEO of Sherritt International. "We ended the quarter with 
more cash on hand, less debt, and higher cash received from the Moa JV 
-- all clear signs of progress."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pathe added, "With 
production challenges at the Moa JV caused by excessive rainfall and 
rail transportation delays largely behind us, we are bullish about our 
prospects for the balance of 2018 given the favorable outlook for nickel
 and cobalt prices due to favorable demand trends, particularly within 
the electric vehicle battery market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q1 HIGHLIGHTS </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">   -- Average-realized prices at the Moa Joint Venture ("Moa JV") for nickel 
      improved 26% to $7.80 per pound while average-realized prices for cobalt 
      increased 100% to $48.47 per pound. 
 
   -- Sherritt ended the quarter with $237.3 million in cash, cash equivalents 
      and short-term investments, up from $203.0 million at December 31, 2017. 
 
   -- Sherritt strengthened its balance sheet by purchasing for cancellation 
      $121.2 million of outstanding debentures at an aggregate cost of $110.3 
      million through a modified Dutch auction tender offer. The transaction, 
      which was funded by a unit offering that generated net proceeds of 
      approximately $125 million, brings the total amount of indebtedness 
      eliminated by the Corporation over the past four years to approximately 
      $2 billion. 
 
   -- Received $16.0 million from the Moa JV as repayment on its working 
      capital facility and US$40.7 million in Cuban <b>energy</b> payments, lowering 
      overdue scheduled receivables to $126.7 million from $132.6 million at 
      year end 2017. 
 
   -- Net direct cash cost (NDCC)(1) at the Moa Joint Venture was US$2.06 per 
      pound of finished nickel sold, marking the fourth consecutive quarter 
      that the Moa JV is in the lowest cost quartile. 
   -- Sherritt's share of finished nickel production at the Moa JV was 2,854 
      tonnes in Q1 2018, down 26% from Q1 2017, while its share of finished 
      cobalt was 336 tonnes, down 23% from Q1 2017. Consistent with previous 
      disclosure, the decline in production in Q1 2018 was attributable to the 
      reduced availability of mixed sulphides due to the highest level of 
      rainfall at Moa's operations in more than 20 years and rail 
      transportation delays to the refinery in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta by 
      the rail service provider. Subsequent to quarter end, delays with rail 
      transportation service have largely been resolved and mixed sulphides 
      availability has been restored to normal levels. 
   -- Executed a three-year extension of the Puerto Escondido/Yumuri oil 
      production sharing contract to 2021. 
 
   -- Adjusted EBITDA was $36.4 million, relatively flat when compared to Q1 
      2017. Adjusted EBITDA in Q1 2018 reflected the impact of the 
      restructuring of the Ambatovy Joint Venture completed in December 2017 
      that reduced Sherritt's ownership interest from 40% to 12%. 
 
   -- Net loss for Q1 2018 was $0.6 million or $nil on a per share basis. In Q1 
      2017, net loss was $72.6 million or $0.25 per share. 
 
   -- Q1 results marked Sherritt's first full quarter of operations since its 
      ownership interest at Ambatovy was reduced to 12% as a result of the 
      Joint Venture restructuring completed in December 2017. </pre>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HIGHLIGHTS SUBSEQUENT TO QUARTER END </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">   -- Sherritt finalized the evaluation of available and proven technology to 
      complete drilling of the second well on Block 10 targeting the Lower 
      Veloz reservoir. A proven technology solution has been selected and will 
      be deployed when drilling is slated to resume in early July 2018. 
      Preliminary drilling results are expected in Q3 2018. Capital budgeted to

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Q1 2018, Sherritt 
generated consolidated cash flow from operations of $11.1 million. The 
consolidated total included $7.3 million in positive cash flow from the 
Oil and Gas division and $11.2 million in positive cash flow 
contributions from the Power division. Interest expenses of $11.0 
million negatively impacted the consolidated cash flow total for Q1 
2018. Although the Moa JV generated positive cash flow in Q1 2018, the 
total was distributed to Sherritt as a repayment of its working capital 
facility. The repayment does not impact Sherritt's operating cash flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash, cash equivalents 
and short-term investments at March 31, 2018 were $237.3 million, up 
from $203.0 million at December 31, 2017. The increase was due to a 
number of factors, including the close of a unit offering that generated
 net proceeds of approximately $125 million, the receipt of $16 million 
from the Moa JV on its working capital facility and the receipt of 
US$40.7 million in Cuban <b>energy</b> payments. In Q4 2017, Sherritt received US7.5 million in Cuban <b>energy</b> payments.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">METAL MARKETS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nickel</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nickel prices continued 
to rally in Q1 2018, sustaining the momentum established in second half 
of 2017. The average reference price in Q1 2018 was US$6.03/lb, up 29% 
from US$4.66/lb in the first quarter of 2017. The average reference 
price for Q1 2018 marked the highest since Q1 2015 when it was 
US$6.50/lb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year-over-year price 
improvement was driven by a number of developments, Chief among them is 
the growing understanding of the important role that Class I nickel will
 play in the growing electric vehicle (EV) market. Class I nickel, along
 with cobalt, are key metals needed to manufacture EV batteries. Demand 
for Class I nickel and cobalt are expected to grow significantly 
beginning in 2019 when China expects to begin production quotas 
requiring that 10% of all vehicles manufactured be electric.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(MORE TO FOLLOW)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sherritt Reports First Quarter 2018 Results -2-</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in the nickel reference price was also driven by the decline in inventories. Combined <span class="companylink">LME</span>
 and SHFE nickel inventories at March 31 2018, declined to 367,694 
tonnes (from 410,828 tonnes) at the start of the year. A further decline
 in visible inventories is expected to sustain the price increase 
momentum through the end of 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond 2018, nickel 
supply deficits are expected to widen as stainless steel sector growth 
is expected to outpace nickel production. The supply deficit is expected
 to be exacerbated with the rise of the electric vehicle market and the 
need for Class I nickel for battery production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cobalt</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cobalt prices rose in Q1 
2018, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of higher reference 
prices. The average-reference price for Q1 2018 was US$39.01/lb, up 97% 
from US$19.80/lb for Q1 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The near doubling of 
cobalt prices over the past year is primarily linked to the growing 
strong demand emanating from the EV battery market. Higher cobalt prices
 were also driven by geopolitical and supply risk concerns given that 
the Democratic Republic of Congo is currently the world's largest source
 of cobalt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As cobalt prices have a 
limited impact on overall battery pack costs, high prices are not 
expected to cause supply-chain disruptions or delay EV market growth. As
 a result, the risk of cobalt substitution in EV battery production in 
the near term is relatively low given cobalt's unique <b>energy</b> 
transference properties. While battery manufacturers continue to explore
 alternatives to cobalt, the likely beneficiary of any substitution is 
expected to be Class I nickel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the cobalt 
market's limited size, significant product orders cause price surges. As
 end-users are trying to build cobalt positions or to secure long-term 
supply, spot metal availability is sporadic and prices are expected to 
remain elevated in the near term.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(2) Average low-grade cobalt published price per Metals Bulletin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Moa JV produced 2,854
 tonnes of finished nickel in Q1 2018, down 26% from 3,840 tonnes 
produced in Q1 2017. Finished cobalt production in Q1 2018 was 336 
tonnes, down 23% from 436 tonnes produced in Q1 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The production decline in
 Q1 2018 was principally due to reduced availability of mixed sulphides 
caused by the highest level of rainfall at Moa's operations in more than
 20 years that limited access to planned mining areas as well as by 
transportation delays to the refinery by the rail service provider. The 
adverse impact of excessive rain fall and rail transportation delays 
have been alleviated since the start of the second quarter, and Sherritt
 expects to achieve the lower end of its 2018 production guidance for 
finished nickel and finished cobalt at the Moa JV. Second quarter 
production will be impacted, however, by the annual shutdown of the 
refinery in Fort Saskatchewan due to scheduled maintenance activities. 
This year's shutdown is expected to be similar in duration to prior 
years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q1 2018 revenue for the 
Moa JV and the Fort Site totaled $96.3 million, up 7% from $90.4 million
 for the comparable period of 2017. The growth was driven by higher 
realized prices in 2018 for nickel (+26%), cobalt (+100%) and fertilizer
 (+4%) although offset by lower sales volume and a higher Canadian 
dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nickel sales represented 
52% of total Q1 2018 revenue while cobalt sales represented 36%. 
Fertilizer sales in Q1 2018 were down 29% from last year, reflecting 
lower demand and timing of shipments ahead of the spring season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mining, processing and 
refining (MPR) costs for Q1 2018 were US$5.26 per pound, up 11% from 
US$4.75 per pound for Q1 2017. The increase was due to the impact of 
lower production as well to higher input costs, including increased 
sulphur and <b>energy</b> costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite higher <b>energy</b>
 and sulphur input costs and lower production, Moa's NDCC of US$2.06/lb 
for Q1 2018 was in the lowest cost quartile relative to other nickel 
producers, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of such distinction. 
NDCC in Q1 2018 declined by 37% compared to the prior year period, 
largely because of a higher cobalt by-product credit. The cobalt credit 
of US$4.27/lb reflects Moa's high cobalt to nickel production ratio as 
well as the 100% growth in cobalt prices since Q1 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given current commodity 
prices and the expected rate of production for the balance of the year, 
NDCC guidance at Moa for 2018 has been lowered to US$1.75/lb to 
US$2.25/lb from US$2.50/lb to US$3.00/lb of finished nickel previously 
announced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash provided by 
operations in Q1 2018 totaled $18.1 million, up 22% from $14.8, 
reflecting the year-over-year improvement in commodity prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moa's sustaining capital 
spending in Q1 2018 was $4.5 million, up from $2.1 million in Q1 last 
year. The increase was due to planned spending, including the start of 
work at a new slurry preparation plant dump pocket at Moa. The Moa JV is
 expected to continue to operate and fund capital expenditures through 
cash flow generated by the joint venture, or external loans.</p>

Sherritt Reports First Quarter 2018 Results -3-</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sherritt's financial 
results at Ambatovy are presented on a 12% basis for Q1 2018 and on a 
40% basis for Q1 2017. Production totals are presented on a 12% for both
 periods for better comparison purposes. Along with its partners, 
Sherritt completed the restructuring of the Ambatovy Joint Venture on 
December 11, 2017. The restructuring led to Sherritt's ownership 
interest being reduced to 12% in exchange for the elimination of $1.4 
billion of debt. Sherritt will continue to serve as operator of Ambatovy
 at least through 2024, however, as a result of the reduction in its 
ownership interest, Sherritt's ability to direct local decision-making 
at Ambatovy has diminished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On January 6, the 
operations of the Ambatovy Joint Venture were significantly impacted by 
Tropical Cyclone Ava, a Category 2 hurricane equivalent storm. The 
cyclone necessitated a plant shutdown and caused extensive damage to 
facilities and equipment. Production resumed at the end of January 
following the completion of critical repairs. Repairs to damage caused 
by Cyclone Ava are still ongoing. Metal production in Q1 2018 was also 
lower due to limited production of sulphuric acid as a result of a 
failed economizer in Acid Plant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consistent with previous 
disclosure, metal production at Ambatovy will continue to be constrained
 by lower production of sulphuric acid in Q2 2018. Lower production of 
sulphuric acid is due to the failed economizer in Acid Plant 1, which is
 currently operating at approximately 50% of capacity. Acid Plant 2 is 
operating at 100% capacity. Production capacity is expected to be back 
to normal once the economizer in Acid Plant 1 is replaced in May 2018. 
Replacement of the economizer will necessitate a shutdown of Acid Plant 1
 for approximately three weeks.</p>

production at Ambatovy in Q1 2018 was 668 tonnes (12% basis), down from 
1,145 tonnes (12% basis) produced in Q1 2017. Finished cobalt production
 in Q1 2018 was 49 tonnes (12% basis), down from 97 tonnes (12% basis) 
for Q1 2017. The decline was principally due to the impact of Cyclone 
Ava and effects of the failed economizer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MPR costs for Q1 2017 
were US$7.90 per pound, up from US$5.53 per pound in Q1 2017. The 
year-over-year increase was largely due to the impact of lower 
production volumes in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NDCC for finished nickel 
at Ambatovy in Q1 2018 was US$5.34/lb, up from the US$3.93/lb for Q1 
2017. The increase was due to lower production, higher maintenance costs
 and higher <b>energy</b> and sulphur input costs offset by higher cobalt by-product credits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In light of current 
commodity prices and the expected rate of production for the balance of 
the year, NDCC guidance at Ambatovy for 2018 has been lowered to 
US$2.50/lb to US$3.00/lb from US$3.00/lb to US$3.50/lb of finished

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross working-interest 
oil production in Q1 2018 in Cuba was 5,572 barrels of oil per day 
("bopd"), down 63% from 15,213 bopd for the comparable period of 2017. 
The decrease was primarily due to the expiration of the Varadero West 
Production Sharing Contract (PSC) in November 2017, natural reservoir 
declines and the absence of new development drilling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue in Q1 2018 was 
$18.1 million, down 49% from $35.3 million for last year. The decline 
was due to lowered production, partially offset by an increase in 
realized prices of 17% to $51.11 per barrel in Cuba, though partially 
offset by the negative impact of a stronger Canadian dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total net 
working-interest production for Q1 2018 was 3,916 barrels of oil 
equivalent per day ("boepd"), down from 8,889 boepd in the same period 
of 2017. The decline was due to the impact of the expiration of the 
Varadero West PSC already noted and the impact of higher oil prices in 
2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unit operating costs in 
Q1 2018 in Cuba were $20.83 per barrel, up 141% from $8.66 in Q1 2017, 
driven largely by reduced production. Costs were positively impacted by 
the strengthening Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar in Q1 
2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exploration spending in 
Q1 2018 was lower than in the comparable period of 2017 as spending was 
primarily focused on detailed engineering for the next well on Block 10.
 In Q1 2017, drilling on the first well on Block 10 was being completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subsequent to quarter 
end, Sherritt finalized the evaluation of available and proven 
technology to complete drilling of the second well on Block 10 targeting
 the Lower Veloz reservoir. A proven technology solution has been 
selected and will be deployed when drilling is slated to resume in early
 July 2018. Preliminary drilling results are expected in Q3 2018. 
Capital budgeted to complete the drilling is expected to be 
approximately US$13 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2&nbsp;Q1 2018 includes a
 provisional pricing adjustment of $(2.3) million (2017 - $2.2 million) 
related to prior shipments, equivalent to $(0.07) per pound (2017 - 
$0.06 per pound) of copper sold during the quarter.&nbsp;</p>

realized copper price does not include any realized derivative losses

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial and Operational Highlights for the Quarter Ended March 31, 2018</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Net income from 
continuing operations of $10.3 million. The net income was attributable 
to higher realized copper prices of $2.98 per pound compared to $2.73 
per pound in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*The absence of any commodity derivative losses as Capstone has been completely unhedged from the beginning of 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Cash flow from operating activities of $32.8 million or $0.08 per common share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Working capital decreased by $5.4 million to $184.0 million at March 31, 2018 from $189.4 million at December 31, 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Operating cash flow 
before changes in working capital1 of $24.6 million or $0.06 per share 
was slightly higher due to higher operating cash flows at Cozamin, 
primarily due to higher copper prices, the absence of any negative 
forward commodity derivative contracts settlements in Q1 2018, mostly 
offset by lower operating cash flows at Minto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Produced a total of 
15,152 tonnes of payable copper from continuing operations at a C1 cash 
cost1 of $1.95 per pound of payable copper produced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Revenue of $103.7 million generated primarily from the sale of 15,962 tonnes of copper from continuing operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Production and Additional Highlights for the Quarter Ended March 31, 2018</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pinto Valley Mine:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Produced 11,421 tonnes 
of copper during Q1 2018 at a C1 cash cost1 of $2.41 per pound of 
payable copper produced and all-in sustaining cost1 of $2.96 per pound 
of payable copper produced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*At Pinto Valley, 
production was lower than planned with throughput and recoveries at the 
low end of expectations due to unplanned downtime. Grade was in line 
with the mine plan for the quarter, with higher head grade and 
production expected over the remainder of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cozamin Mine:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Produced 4,285 tonnes of
 copper during Q1 2018 at a C1 cash cost1 of $0.71 per pound of payable 
copper produced and all-in sustaining cost1 of $1.43 per pound of 
payable copper produced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*At Cozamin, production for the quarter was better than expected from higher grade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Metallurgical test work 
was completed around the technical and economic recoverability of the 
existing zinc resource in the San Rafael zinc zone. This resulted in a 
revision to the mine plan, bringing in additional zinc resources, 
starting in July. It is expected that in 2018 this could double 
contained zinc production (an additional 7 million pounds) and lower C1 
cash cost1 by $0.25 per pound of payable copper produced and all-in 
sustaining cost1 by $0.15 per payable pound produced. Additional zinc 
production of between 7 million and 12 million pounds per year and 
approximately 200,000 ounces of silver per year are anticipated, with 
associated increases to by-product credits over the next&nbsp;three 
years. Copper production remains unchanged as the added zinc processing 
will come from existing unutilized mill capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operating Outlook</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capstone's consolidated production and cost guidance from continuing operations remains unchanged for the full year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cozamin's cost guidance 
has been updated to reflect lower unit costs resulting from the 
additional zinc resources expected to be mined from the San Rafael 
deposit in 2018, lowering Cozamin's expected 2018 C1 cash cost1 by 
approximately $0.25 and all-in sustaining cost1 by approximately $0.15 
per payable pound of copper produced.&nbsp; Cozamin's 2018 capital 
guidance has been increased by $3.0 million as a result of this change, 
primarily related to the additional required development to access the 
San Rafael zone. Cozamin's expected 2018 copper production remains 
unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exploration cost guidance
 is unchanged.&nbsp; Consolidated capital guidance is $90.0 million with
 the addition of the $3.0 million development expenditure related to San
 Rafael zone at Cozamin.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This news release 
contains disclosure that has been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of Canadian securities laws, which differ from the 
requirements of US securities laws. Without limiting the foregoing, this
 news release may refer to technical reports that use the terms 
"indicated" and "inferred" resources. US investors are cautioned that, 
while such terms are recognized and required by Canadian securities 
laws, the <span class="companylink">SEC</span> does not recognize them. 
Under US standards, mineralization may not be classified as a "reserve" 
unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be 
economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve 
determination is made. US investors are cautioned not to assume that all
 or any part of indicated resources will ever be converted into 
reserves. US investors should also understand that "inferred resources" 
have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to 
whether they can be mined legally or economically. It cannot be assumed 
that all or any part of "inferred resources" will ever be upgraded to a 
higher category. Therefore, US investors are also cautioned not to 
assume that all or any part of inferred resources exist, or that they 
can be mined legally&nbsp;or economically. Accordingly, information 
concerning descriptions of mineralization and resources contained in

 Minister Justin Trudeau is traveling through Europe this week, standing
 shoulder-to-shoulder with world leaders as he charmingly promotes 
Canada as a nation that is open for investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, we at home are
 left to muse about Trudeau's seeming inability to ensure that such 
opportunity truly exists in Canada and for Canadians.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite his many promises, Trudeau has done nothing to ensure the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 pipeline will become a reality. His unwillingness to take an 
authoritative and supportive stand behind the project now has investors 
in the $7.4-billion pipeline prepared to take their dollars elsewhere. 
Thousands of jobs, the viability of Alberta's economy and Canada's "open
 for business" status are all at stake, yet Trudeau appears content to 
remain on the sidelines as tensions rise across the country, with 
threats of interprovincial trade wars and constitutional challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years of careful reviews and innumerable environmental studies, the <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span>,
 the federal government and the prime minister all concluded that the 
pipeline is safe. Every court challenge has ruled in favour of the 
project going ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet noisy protestors have
 somehow managed to strip away the legitimacy of the authority that 
stands behind those decisions. They refuse to recognize the rule of law,
 in part because Trudeau himself has allowed them to become legitimate 
influencers of his <b>energy</b> policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2015, he said that 
pipelines were the most responsible way to get oil to markets, but then 
added that pipelines "have to achieve the public trust and the <b>social license</b> that is necessary." <b>Social license</b>? Cue the protestors. With that one comment, Trudeau has given them equal standing with facts, science and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau has long been a 
master of doublespeak, using his smile and adorable socks to take the 
edge off words that might offend. Even as he promises to build a 
pipeline, he has promised to "phase out" the oilsands (the very same 
oilsands for which he claims he is building the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 pipeline). He has said he is committed to moving oil out of Alberta, 
yet has sold his soul to the environmentalists with his unquestioning 
support for carbon taxes as a means of influencing climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunday's pipeline summit 
in Ottawa lasted just a couple of hours and proved to be just one more 
demonstration of Trudeau's inability to exert federal authority for a 
project that is, in his own words, "of vital strategic interest to 
Canada." He offered his usual prime ministerial promises to get the 
pipeline built and even vowed to invest Canadian dollars as a surety of 
his government's support. In doing so, Trudeau played the kind of 
politics that Canadians most loathe - throwing taxpayer money at a 
problem that could (and should) have been handled previously and sans 
lucre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, Trudeau did 
nothing to reduce interprovincial tensions. Alberta Premier Rachel 
Notley has since introduced legislation to stop the flow of oil to B.C.,
 while Premier John Horgan has vowed to continue to resist just so he 
can stay in power. Saskatchewan and Quebec are now getting involved and 
investigating possible actions in support of Alberta and B.C., 
respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The whole country seems on the cusp of a crisis. Well done, Mr. Trudeau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, when a 
Vancouver Sun online poll asked readers if they were surprised by the 
outcome of the so-called pipeline summit, 80 per cent agreed with the 
comment, "No, this is exactly how I thought it would play out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not exactly support 
for Trudeau as a man of action. Rather, it's confirmation that Trudeau 
has played both sides of this debate for too long - neither side sees 
him as able to restore federal authority over the provinces or provide 
the necessary support for a megaproject of vital interest to Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Lead, follow, or get out of the way." It's a basic axiom for successful leadership. Mr. Trudeau would do well to consider it.</p>

JUSTIN TRUDEAU (Canadian Prime Minister): The question is not whether 
the pipeline is going to get built. The question is how the pipeline 
gets built. And we are looking at all options.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON:
 Well the stakes could not be higher for the prime minister today. 
Rushing back from the conference in Peru, Justin Trudeau is now hosting 
an urgent meeting with the premiers of BC and Alberta to try to find a 
way to make sure the Trans Mountain pipeline is going to get built. But 
the company, the proponent, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>,
 they own the pipeline, they've set a deadline, get this going before 
May 31st or we will kill it. Now we just heard from the minister of 
natural resources, Jim Carr, tell us that the government is ready to do 
everything they can to make sure the pipeline gets built. He used the 
word de-risk, which might mean paying for it. Is that enough? Joining us
 from Calgary, Conservative MP Michelle Rempel; and in Victoria, we're 
joined by the NDP MP Murray Rankin. Great to have both of you here. 
Michelle Rempel, let me start with you. What more do you think the 
government can do to make sure this pipeline gets built?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MICHELLE REMPEL 
(Conservative – Alberta): They can invoke section 92.10 C of the 
Constitution Act to ensure that any remaining issues that have 
provincial jurisdiction fall into federal purview. They can make sure 
that any court cases that Premier Horgan might put forward to try and 
delay the pipeline becomes directly referred to the Supreme Court. They 
can scrap Bill C-69 which the pipeline association has said if this bill
 goes through there will be no more pipelines built in Canada. They can 
enforce the rule of law in terms of protests. You know, I could go on 
and on. The thing that you just said, de-risk, this is what Jim Carr 
just said to you. They want to use taxpayer dollars to, I'm assuming it 
will be like a guarantee or something, Evan, all they want to do is kick
 this down the road past the election so that their BC Liberal MPs can 
get re-elected. So when you think about that, when you think about the 
fact that they ask Canadians to pay a carbon tax to get <b>social license</b>
 to get this built, which it didn't, and now they want federal tax 
dollars to de-risk it for them. This isn't about de-risking it for <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> or for <b>energy</b>
 sector workers, this is about politically de-risking it in the hopes 
that it will die somewhere after the election. And that is disgusting, 
and every Canadian, regardless of what side of the pipeline debate 
they're on, should be holding the government to attack. It's just 
fekless arrogance. It's disgusting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Okay, strong 
words there. They say they're trying to de-risk it, Murray Rankin. In 
other words, to try to get out of this May 31st deadline in some way, 
and support Rachel Notley's idea of investing in the pipeline. What's 
your view of what they're doing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MURRAY RANKIN (NDP – BC):
 Well, first of all, May 31st is a deadline set by a Houston-based 
company. Since when do allow American companies to tell us what to do in
 Canada? We have a federal government. We have provincial governments 
that do that. We wouldn't be in this mess, as you know, I think, if it 
weren't for the fact that Mr. Trudeau came to my riding of Victoria in 
the election when he was a candidate and said, you know, we're going to 
redo this whole process, and look at how diluted bitumen performs in 
marine environment, get First Nations better involved, etcetera. They 
didn't do any of that. Now we are faced with two things. We're faced 
with massive opposition to this on our coast, and we're faced with a 
provincial government of Mr. Horgan that has a strong mandate from the 
people to oppose the risk, to deal with the risks that this pipeline is 
going to create.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Now this 
meeting, this summit, Michelle Rempel, he's have got Rachel Notley in a 
room, and he's got Mr. Premier Horgan in the room, and he's got to come 
up with something. Horgan's political life depends on opposing this. 
He's in a coalition with the Green Party. They don't want the pipeline. 
They're trying to either, "A", delay it to death, they don't want to do 
it. They say they have jurisdiction over the environment. What does 
Justin Trudeau have to say to Premier Horgan right now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: Find his spine 
and be the prime minister of Canada. This is a project that's in the 
national interest that passed one of the most rigorous environmental 
review processes in the world. We are not talking with Venezuela or 
Saudi Arabia. And, you know, Murray's comment about we won't let 
Houston-based organizations tell us where to go, that organization is 
about to put $7.4 billion into the Canadian economy. And, frankly, how 
much money have American environmental NGOs put into the opposition of 
this pipe pipeline? So I find it a little rich that an NDP MP, who many 
organizations that are funding the anti-pipeline protests have money 
from outside of the country. To me this is about a project that unites 
the country. I mean I have a lot of respect for Murray. The reality is, 
though, is that this isn't just about British Columbia, this isn't about
 Alberta. This is a project that's in the national interest. To me, this
 is, it's mindboggling that Trudeau won't just come out and say there 
are five or six things that need to be done. Bailing out this project 
will not do those things. He has to get those things done first. And I 
just, you know, it's very frustrating. RANKIN: Evan, I respect Michelle 
enormously, but we're proud Canadians on the west coast too, and I 
resent this notion that Mr. Trudeau is brandishing the term the national
 interest around as if somehow be standing up for our oceans, standing 
with First Nations, standing in favour of endangered killer whales, that
 somehow we're less Canadian. I resent that implication tremendously. 
People out here are proud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Mr. Rankin, just
 to be fair, the term national interest is a legal term of what's in 
the, to invoke what's in the national interest and the federal 
jurisdiction. But let me just try to understand, just a second. Let me 
just, and you're a lawyer, so you know this, I'm trying to appreciate 
the NDP's position. Your leader, Jagmeet Singh, says he doesn't support 
the pipeline, but then he says he wants to go to court to try to 
understand if the government, the federal government has the 
jurisdiction to build it. My question to you, if the courts decide, if 
it went to court, that the government does have the jurisdiction, would 
he flip his support and suddenly the federal NDP would support this 
pipeline?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RANKIN: His position has been I thought constructive to try to suggest that we have a reference to the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>, which we can do very quickly with the support of the government of British Columbia, the <span class="companylink">government of Canada</span>,
 perhaps First Nations, perhaps Alberta. We can go and get a quick 
ruling on whether or not British Columbia's jurisdiction over air, land,
 and water, which all provinces have, give it some ability to stop this 
project, or at least to have a change in regulations at the provincial 
level to address the legitimate concerns that a province like British 
Columbia has. Now if the court comes up with a clear statement that, no,
 British Columbia, you have no jurisdiction at all in the face of a 
federal undertaking, then of course we believe in the rule of law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Okay, so then 
you would support, that's interesting. So then Mr. Singh would say, yes,
 I support the pipeline. I just want to get that clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RANKIN: He would, he's a 
lawyer. He understands that the court has spoken. Now whether or not 
there are other issues that need to be addressed outside of the legal 
process is another thing. But you're asking what that would mean in 
terms of a legal argument, of course he would have to abide and accept 
the judgment of the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Michelle Rempel?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: What you have 
here, Evan, is you've got two political parties that do not want this 
pipeline built. So what we have seen over the last 10 years is these two
 political parties use the environmental review process to put in place 
uncertainty with the hope that these projects will just die or go away 
without them having to make the political decision, or the words coming 
out of their mouth we do not want this pipeline built. And that's what 
Murray just danced around. This is really the shamefulness of this. I 
would actually, I would rather have the discussion where, you know, I 
remember sitting with an NDP candidate during the election on national 
TV where she just said, you know, oil should stay in the ground. I would
 rather have that debate than the sort of...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RANKIN: We're not talking about that. That is not our position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: Yeah, but we are. We are. That is where the...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RANKIN: No. Absolutely 
not! REMPEL: That is where, that's where the debate is at right now. So 
why should we raise taxpayer resources guaranteeing things, tying up the
 court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RANKIN: Well the debate is Mr. Carr is talking about de-risking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: De-risking for who? For politicians!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RANKIN: Yeah, exactly. Exactly! What does that do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: This just needs to get built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RANKIN: What does that 
do? What does the ownership of part of this pipeline by the governments 
of Alberta and Canada have to do the legal jurisdiction at all? Nothing!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> didn't ask for the nationalization. <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> did not ask for the nationalization of <b>energy</b> infrastructure. And frankly the last time a socialist nationalized Canada's <b>energy</b> industry, it didn't go so well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Okay. I got to 
leave it there, Murray Rankin and Michelle Rempel. We'll find out more 
today what does happen. Thanks so much for joining us. Coming up, after 
the missile strikes in Syria, what is next? Was it really mission 
accomplished, or is the situation about to spin out of control? Retired 
Major General Dave Fraser and Canada's former top spy Dick Fadden are

 investors spooked by the uncertainty plaguing the planned Trans 
Mountain pipeline expansion, Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr said 
Friday as a high-level, make-or-break meeting loomed on the horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government is still 
examining its options, Carr said, but won't commit to a course of action
 before Sunday, when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau jets home from Peru 
for a hastily organized meeting in Ottawa with British Columbia Premier 
John Horgan and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What
 we're now faced with is to find ways to make sure there is more 
certainty than there is now," Carr said in an interview with The <span class="companylink">Canadian Press</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One of the ways to make 
sure there is more certainty is to look at possible financial 
arrangements that would help de-risk the project."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pipeline builder Kinder 
Morgan has halted all non-essential spending on the project until it 
gets assurances from Ottawa that the issues will be resolved. The 
federal government has until May 31 to respond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau has put a lot of 
political eggs in the Trans Mountain basket, risking political capital 
among climate-change activists in search of middle ground that allows 
for pipeline construction alongside improved <span class="companylink">environmental safeguards</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau, who is currently
 in Peru for the Summit of the Americas, was originally supposed to fly 
to Paris directly from Lima on Sunday for meetings with French President
 Emmanuel Macron. Instead, he'll be back in the national capital in 
search of a resolution to an intractable — and politically perilous — 
dispute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carr refused to discuss 
the specific financial options available, other than to say there are 
many of them on the table and they're all being considered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of those options, 
however, is to buy a stake in the pipeline, something Notley has already
 said Alberta would be willing to do. Canada and Alberta could jointly 
buy the pipeline outright, or at least a significant stake in the 
project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another option is to 
provide a guaranteed source of revenue for private investors if the 
pipeline completion date misses the target for when returns on their 
investments were supposed to start flowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company had targeted 
May 31 as the make-or-break deadline to start construction if the 
pipeline was to hit those investment targets. That date is now the 
drop-dead date <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> has given Canada to prove the company should have the confidence to move forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Political strategist 
Robin Sears, a principal at Earnscliffe Strategy Group, said another 
option would be to increase spending on the environmental protection 
side, including on improved research into preventing and mitigating the 
impacts of a diluted bitumen spill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The company has not done
 what it needs to have done to satisfy the people of B.C. they have 
taken the steps necessary to protect the environment," said <span class="companylink">Sears</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sears said the Trudeau 
government has an oceans protection plan on paper, but hasn't done much 
if anything to put it into action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carr was only prepared to
 say Sunday's meeting between Trudeau and the premiers would be a chance
 for the various sides to share their positions and try and talk things 
out — not necessarily a day when further action would be announced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, said <span class="companylink">Sears</span>, would be a bad political move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If they come out of that
 meeting on Sunday and (Trudeau) says, 'We've made good progress and I'm
 off to Paris,' it will cost them severely," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">University of British 
Columbia politics professor Kathryn Harrison said she doesn't know that 
there is a way for everyone to come out of Sunday's meeting with a win.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They have drawn lines in the sand that are simply incompatible," said Harrison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau and Carr have 
spent more than two years accusing the former Conservative government of
 themselves failing to build pipelines because they stacked the deck 
against environmental concerns, failing in the process to get the <b>social license</b> necessary to allow the projects to proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals introduced 
new review processes that accounted for things like the potential 
greenhouse gas emissions resulting from increased oil flows. The <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span>'s 2016 approval of Trans Mountain required monitoring and upstream emissions offsets related to construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But environmental 
concerns remain — including the risk of higher emissions from increased 
oilsands production and the environmental impact of a spill. As a 
result, environmentalists who helped get Trudeau elected are now 
doubting his commitment to the cause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harrison said Trudeau has
 staked a claim on being able to reconcile both interests, offering up 
the pipeline — and the resulting ability to get resources to market — as
 a quid pro quo to get provincial and stakeholder support for a carbon 
price and environmental investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That was the compromise 
and they got pretty far with it," Harrison said, noting all provinces 
but Saskatchewan signed onto the climate change framework.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're at that point now 
where the trains are colliding. This is a moment of truth for Canada and
 a country that relies heavily on producing fossil fuels."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome to government, 
where events never pause and most days are an endless series of bad and 
worse choices. Trudeau is certainly down to bad and worse on the 
question of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s crown jewel, which happens to double as his fig-leaf on oil and gas policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau the green 
carbon-taxer might really, really (really) want this singular pipeline 
built, but if the company building it is now wavering, and the Green 
party dependent NDP premier of the province through which it must pass 
hasn't yet found a body he won't chuck in front of it, at what point do 
you call a spade no spade and concede the Earth will not be moving?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps fearing for its economic and constitutional credibility, the answer from Team Trudeau is a ringing "not now, not ever."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are determined to see
 (Trans Mountain) built," Trudeau has told reporters. "It is in the 
national interest. It doesn't make any sense for us to continue to have a
 $15-billion discount on our oil resources because we are trapped with 
an American market. We need to get our resources to new markets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed. The same words could have - and did - come out of Stephen Harper's mouth. Trudeau now has to bell the cat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Green Party Leader Elizabeth May, centre, is arrested by RCMP officers after joining protesters outside <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s facility in Burnaby, B.C., on March 23, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't meant to be 
this way. Harper's confrontational "cram-them-down-your-throats" 
pipeline policy was to be replaced with Trudeau's more charismatic 
approach that would accrue the "<b>social license</b>" needed to grease 
construction, a canard that happens to be, despite the environmental 
hysteria, the only fauna killed to date along the pipeline's route.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To frame the debate as pro-economy versus pro-environment is to miss the point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Trans Mountain 
ultimately proves is the past 20 years of debate in Canada has split 
people into two irreconcilable camps: pro-oil and anti-oil. Preening at 
climate summits and taxing carbon won't make exporting oil kosher to 
those who are resolutely opposed. Over their dead bodies is the message 
being passed to Trudeau at the minute. It's not a question of law, it's a
 matter of will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Giddy though the 
opposition parties might be, now is not the time for them to revel in 
Trudeau's mire. Seeing your opponent hoist with his own petard is 
satisfying, but if the pipeline really is in Canada's national interest -
 and it is - the opposition should offer some constructive suggestions 
along with any withering scorn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the rather shouty and petty state of modern politics, this won't happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The partisan urge to 
nanny-nanny-boo-boo is too strong and besides, Conservatives will say, 
the Liberals didn't exactly lift a finger of support in opposition 
before assuming office and turning the matter into a constitutional 
crisis. Further disincentivizing bipartisan efforts is the Trudeau 
carbon tax, a big part of the government's <b>social license</b> play that is not particularly well-read by any capital-C Conservative.</p>

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley talks to cabinet members about the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline expansion, in Edmonton on Monday, April 9, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here, Trudeau shoulders a good chunk of the blame. For all his talk of kumbaya, Trudeau's Pan Canadian Framework for Clean <b>Energy</b>
 and Climate Change - with its plan for carbon "pricing" - was 
effectively crammed down provincial throats. And with Rachel Notley and 
Kathleen Wynne's governments now in severe financial distress, voters 
there and across Canada will surely begin to wonder why the hell they're
 on the road to higher taxes if those uppity British Columbians aren't 
holding up their end of the <b>social-license</b> bargain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is where federal NDP
 leader Jagmeet Singh should have a useful intervention to make, given 
it's his provincial brethren on opposite sides of the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 dispute. But to hope for substance from Singh is to wish for unicorns. 
Singh has done the easy thing and sided with B.C. and its brighter 
federal electoral prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where does this leave Trans Mountain? Shorn of friends and solutions, but all is not yet lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government can, and 
should, re-assert its constitutional right to build the pipeline. And 
yes, the feds can join Alberta in slapping down money and insurance 
guarantees. But that's only half the battle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Protesters chant as they wait for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's arrival to meet with members of the <span class="companylink">Canadian Coast Guard</span> to discuss marine safety and spill prevention, in Victoria on Thursday, April 5, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the communities along 
the pipeline route remain ready to obstruct its construction it's going 
to take a lot more than bucks and words to clear the way. Even the stern
 words of a judge urging protesters out of the way might not do the 
trick. What then?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's well known that 
Canada's regulatory environment is among the most robust in the world, 
ensuring the highest regard for the environment, including limiting 
greenhouse gas emissions. In recent years, Alberta has imposed a carbon 
tax and capped oilsands emissions in the naive hope of securing 
so-called <b>social license</b> for pipeline development. Everyone knows how that has turned out.</p>

 ocean away, the United Nations body that regulates the international 
shipping industry is meeting in London this week to see if it can agree 
on a strategy to reduce emissions from the cargo ships, oil tankers and 
other vessels that traverse the planet's oceans. This is serious work, 
because such emissions were excluded from the Paris Climate Agreement in
 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This means that when 
Eastern Canada buys its fuel from countries such as Saudi Arabia, 
Azerbaijan, Nigeria and Angola, the oil isn't just produced using less 
rigorous environmental standards than those in Canada. It also means the
 oil tankers that transport foreign oil to our shores aren't subjected 
to controls on their greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">UN</span>'s <span class="companylink">International Maritime Organization</span> says such vessels risk becoming the singlelargest source of planet-warming greenhouse gases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet Eastern Canadians welcome the tankers with open arms, while vehemently opposing Canadian pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If action isn't taken, 
the organization says emissions from shipping could grow by up to 250 
per cent by 2050. International shipping emissions are not assigned to 
any one country, according to The <span class="companylink">Canadian Press</span>,
 but on their own, they are higher than the total emissions from all but
 the six biggest national emitters - China, the United States, India, 
Russia, Japan and Germany.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's an indignity that 
Albertans and their economy have been placed in a straitjacket for no 
apparent purpose by Premier Rachel Notley and Prime Minister Justin 
Trudeau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government 
even changed the rules recently to require future pipeline projects to 
calculate the upstream and downstream environmental emissions - which is
 pollution produced during extraction and when the fuel is burned in 
vehicles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No such burden is placed 
on Eastern Canadian carmakers or plane manufacturers, of course. Or on 
ships that deliver foreign oil to Eastern ports.</p>

 consult with stakeholders to determine whether the project will 
continue construction through B.C. and whether shareholders can be 
protected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the company cannot 
reach an agreement with the various stakeholders by the May 31 deadline,
 Kinder Morgan chairman and CEO Steve Kean said it is "difficult to 
conceive of any scenario in which we would proceed with the project."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a Sunday press 
conference, Premier Rachel Notley said "this pipeline will be built". 
and threatened government action against B.C. if John Horgan's 
government - whom she called "short-sighted" - continued to oppose the 
project. She called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to act in defence 
of the project, which the federal government has approved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Albertans have been clear: Get this pipeline built. And Albertans are right," said Notley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Never count Alberta out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This pipeline will be 
built. Tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars to the economy.
 Better public schools. Better public hospitals. That's what this 
pipeline means for us and for our country as a whole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are also calling on 
the federal government to act in the defence of Alberta and working 
people in Western Canada in the way they have in the past for other 
parts of this country. A federal approval of a project must be worth 
more than the paper it's written on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warkentin said he shares "the frustration of Albertans" but is not surprised to see the project "faltering".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Canadians have come to expect this lack of progress, given the Prime Minister's track record of failure," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Canadians deserve a 
government that will actually get the job done. On behalf of the 
residents in the Peace Country and across Alberta and Canada, I'll 
continue to fight for economic opportunities in the <b>energy</b> sector and advocate for important pipelines that will help export our products to the world."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late Sunday, Trudeau tweeted the federal government "will act within national interests".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Access to world markets 
for Canadian resources is a core national interest. The Trans Mountain 
expansion will be built," tweeted Trudeau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley said Sunday the 
province is prepared to invest in the pipeline directly if it would help
 keep investors on board - a notion opposition rival, UCP Leader Jason 
Kenney, said he would support as long as Ottawa also puts money on the 
table.</p>

 SACHEDINA: Hello everyone, and welcome to "Power Play" for Friday, 
April 6th, the day when of fears of a US trade war with China sent the 
Dow plunging more than 500 points to the end week. More on that in just a
 moment. Coming up on the show, we'll talk to federal Conservative 
leader Andrew Scheer about trade tensions between Canada and the US, and
 his new demand that he will only accept a private classified briefing 
about the prime minister's trip to India after MPs get an unclassified 
one first. Also ahead, the prime minister's trip to Canada's oil 
heartland and how successful he was in winning over those who say his 
leadership on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion has been weak. And 
mega millionaire Kevin O'Leary talks to us about the money troubles 
stemming from his failed Conservative campaign bid. But first, a steep 
sell-off on the markets today after Donald Trump threatens China with an
 additional $100 billion in new tariffs, but the US's trading 
relationship with Canada and Mexico was also in the spotlight today. 
With his take on how <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> talks are 
going, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer joins me now. Mr. Scheer, it's 
great to have you on. I want to play a clip of the prime minister who 
was in Fort McMurray today and then get your reaction on that if we can.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
JUSTIN TRUDEAU (Canadian Prime Minister): We're pleased at the amount of
 chapters that have been closed, at the progress that has been made on a
 number of issues, but we're going to keep going and demonstrate that we
 take this issue very seriously. We'll continue to defend Canadian jobs,
 but we're hopeful to get positive news in the coming times. We're going
 to accept a good deal for Canada, not just any old deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: There is word 
that there may be an agreement in principle they may be ready to sign 
and approve at the Summit of the Americas next week. Can you at least 
give the government credit for coming as far as they have?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
ANDREW SCHEER (Conservative Leader): Well I'll give the government 
credit in the sense that dealing with President Trump on trade is no 
easy task. Usually you have a president that has a philosophical 
approach, either a free marketer or a protectionist, and you can kind of
 see that applied across. Mr. Trump seems to have a sector-by-sector 
approach all through the lens as to whether or not the US has a trade 
surplus or deficit in each specific commodity, which is not a 
conventional way to adopt that. We've been critical of the Liberal 
response early on. We think that they were late to the game in building 
the alliances throughout the US that we needed to build to get American 
pressure on the US administration. That started to happen recently, but 
we would have liked to have seen it earlier. We've been supportive of 
the government's efforts. I led a Conservative delegation down to 
Washington to show that united front. We want to help. We want Canada to
 get the very best deal that we can. It's so important. It transcends 
political lines. Encouraged to see the focus on actual market access and
 trade. You'll remember the Liberals were trying to bring in a lot of 
social policy into the negotiations, that didn't seem to go well. We 
hear a lot of talk that they've now pulled back from that and are 
focusing more on the economics and the reduction of trade barriers. 
We'll have to wait and see what comes out, though. No one has any 
details on specifics. We don't know if this is a general agreement with 
not a lot of details, or if this is a more substantial conclusion. We'll
 have more to say once we know what's in the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: One of the 
issues that you have not been supportive of is the government's plan 
when it comes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. You have spoken out 
strongly about the carbon tax, and this was one of the issues that has 
come up during the prime minister's tour of western Canada. First of 
all, do you believe that global warming is manmade? SCHEER: I believe 
that human beings absolutely have an impact on climate change. I believe
 that human beings emit all kinds of things into our environment that we
 need to address, that we need to reduce what we do emit into the 
environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: So if it's not
 a carbon tax, I haven't heard you talk much about what your plan is to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. SCHEER: Well keep in mind that the 
previous Conservative government actually reduced emissions without a 
carbon tax. We did that through incentivizing efficiencies, with, in 
encouraging people to, all kinds of things, from retrofitting their 
homes to regulating emissions on a sector-by-sector approach. I believe 
it's possible. But I'd like to flip this around a little bit, because 
here we have the environment minister and the prime minister both not 
being able to say how much the carbon tax will reduce emissions by. They
 were asked point blank questions, the minister of environment at 
committee, Justin Trudeau by myself in question period, I asked him by 
how much will emissions go down with a carbon tax. They don't have an 
answer. So I would challenge them to say what is the proof that the 
carbon tax actually works? Canadians don't support it. It hasn't given 
us the so-called <b>social license</b> to get important <b>energy</b> projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: But there are 
targets that Canada has signed on to in the Paris accord. So if you were
 to be prime minister after next year's election, is that an accord that
 you would stay in, or would you withdraw from that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: Well, we voted in
 favour of the motion upholding the Paris accord targets. I would also 
point out that after campaigning against the Conservative targets for 
reductions of greenhouse emissions, Justin Trudeau went to Paris and 
signed on to the exact same targets the Conservatives were proposing. So
 he's adopted our approach on this. But one thing that's not our 
approach is a carbon tax. I'm against it. I will repeal it. I don't 
believe it will reduce emissions. I think there's a more positive way to
 incentivize people and companies to reduce emissions without just 
grabbing more money from the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: I want to talk
 a little bit about the Atwal affair and switch gears. Today you are now
 saying that you will not accept this private classified briefing until 
MPs get one that's unclassified. Is there a danger here? Are you worried
 that you're overplaying your hand? I mean you know there's a filibuster
 in the house. MPs were up for a long time. You can basically just claim
 victory and walk away. Why this new demand now? SCHEER: It's not a new 
demand. When you look at the letter that I sent the clerk of the Privy 
Council, it was saying, look, we'll have a briefing, and we'll have it 
all together, and we'll go through all the publicly available 
information that can be disseminated publicly, and then anything 
classified I will stay and receive that. In a counter response, the 
clerk, Daniel Jean, has effectively indicated he'd be willing to go to 
committee. The reason why I'm concerned about this is because just a few
 weeks ago, Justin Trudeau used his majority on that committee, on the 
very committee that now Daniel jean is offering to go in front of, used 
his majority to vote against inviting him to committee. So their track 
record on this is not one that I have a lot of confidence in. They voted
 against the motion to invite him to testify. They put their MPs through
 20 hours of a marathon vote in order to avoid the very thing that now 
we're seeing. So all I've said to the Privy Council office is, great, 
happy to have a classified briefing, let me know when the public 
briefing takes place and then we can work on a date after that. I 
believe it's so important. Why the cover-up? Why they're going to such 
great lengths to avoid what was already told to reporters and 
journalists being told to parliament. We have conflicting information. 
Ralph Goodale , the minister of public safety, says that if we want to 
know information we can read it all in the media because it's all been 
reported, and then we have journalists who were on the call, on that 
conference call saying, no, no, we were told not to report some things. 
So there's, someone is not saying something that's true, and we want to 
get to the bottom of this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: So walk me through this. When will that briefing happen with you, and when will it happen with the committee?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: Well, as, my 
understanding is that Mr. Jean has reached out to the chair of the 
committee, the Liberal chair. We want that to happen very quickly. We 
want Liberals on that committee to support the idea of having a public 
hearing on this. We understand that there are some things that the 
national security advisor would know that's classified that can't be 
said in a public forum. That's fine. And he can instruct the committee 
as to when that happens. But everything that was said to journalists and
 reporters, I believe it's only right that the Canadian people have 
their elected representatives hear the same thing. After that I will 
very quickly find the right time to have that briefing on the classified
 side as was offered to me. I think that's important too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: I also want to
 get your reaction. We know that Rob Ford , who is vying to be Ontario's
 premier, is not going to have a campaign bus for journalists. What's 
your reaction to that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: I really don't have one. I don't know the logistics of running.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: Surely you must be able to say something about that. Do you support the idea or not?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: Look, every 
individual campaign will come up with their own media strategy. I have a
 media plan myself. I try to be as accessible as I can and speak to 
journalists when they're covering topics that they want to hear my voice
 on. We'll have our own plan for the federal campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: But this is a 
guy, if you're prime minister, you might have to work alongside. Can you
 say, you have talked about the role of the media, you know the previous
 Conservative government had somewhat of a fractious relationship with 
the media. Do you endorse Mr. Ford's...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: I really don't 
have views on how other people run their campaigns. When I ran for the 
leadership I had my own plan, I was often asked to comment on other 
people's style or other people's camps. I do my own thing. I run my own 
campaign. I'll be happy to work with the next premier of Ontario on 
issues. Hopefully it's a Conservative premier who wants to repeal the 
carbon tax, who wants to balance the budget and lower taxes. We'll work 
together on issues. I'm not going to weigh in on how he runs his 
campaign, whether or not he has a media bus or prints certain types of 
flyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: Then let me 
ask you this. Are journalists going to be allowed on your campaign bus 
in the campaign next year and on the plane?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: You know what, we
 haven't actually got to the point where we know exactly what we're 
doing in terms of buses and planes, but we'll have a healthy contingent 
of media officials at our events. It's important that I get my message 
out to as many people as I can, and of course the traditional media will
 be important, as will new media, as will new platforms to communicate 
to Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: All right, Mr. Scheer, great having you on. Thanks so much for joining us today. SCHEER: Thank you very much.</p>

 (“Questerre” or the “Company”) (TSX:QEC) (OSE:QEC) reported on the 
progress of the internal feasibility study for its oil shale project in 
Jordan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company has recently engaged <span class="companylink">Hatch Ltd</span>.
 (“Hatch”), a global engineering firm, to integrate and support its 
internal work on the technical and economic feasibility of this project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “This
 is an important milestone. Our preliminary feasibility work has been 
completed. It has not identified any red flags or unexpected technical 
challenges. It also suggests this project could be economic at today’s 
oil prices. We are looking forward to the results of the Hatch 
integration study later this summer to endorse our internal work.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commenting on next steps 
Mr. Binnion added, “Depending on the results of this integration study, 
we would move to pre-FEED engineering. These results and the subsequent 
pre-FEED and FEED engineering will form part of the proposed work 
program for the pre-development phase of a future concession agreement 
with the Jordanian government.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, the 
Company completed a review of the last of its nine studies covering all 
four aspects of the production of crude oil from its project in Jordan. 
These include mining and feed preparation, retorting, power, including 
utilities and infrastructure, and marketing and refining. The studies 
were completed by independent engineering firms including Hatch to 
develop technical and cost-effective solutions for these processes. Due 
to the size of the existing Jordanian refining infrastructure and the 
market for crude products in Jordan, the Company has included the costs 
to upgrade the produced crude oil to finished products including 
gasoline and diesel. Hatch completed four of the nine studies and will 
integrate all the studies into an independent assessment. The design 
basis for this assessment will be an initial project capable of 
sustaining production of 50,000 bbls/d.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The feasibility study 
follows the assessment of the oil shale resource completed by an 
independent qualified resource evaluator, Millcreek Mining Group, in 
accordance with National Instrument 51-101 – Standards of Disclosure for
 Oil and Gas Activities of the Canadian Securities Administrators (“NI 
51-101”) and the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook (“COGE 
Handbook”) (the “Resource Assessment”). The Resource Assessment 
estimates a best estimate of Discovered Petroleum Initially In Place 
(“DPIIP”) of between 7.8 billion and 12.2 billion barrels. The Resource 
Assessment was prepared in accordance with NI 51-101 and the COGE 
Handbook with an effective date of October 1, 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DPIIP was the most 
specific assignable category of resources at the time of the Resource 
Assessment given the preliminary nature of the Resource Assessment, the 
nature of recovery of the hydrocarbons by means of mining and retorting 
and that a program of work to determine commercial viability using 
established technology had not yet been completed. In addition, as a 
result of the preliminary nature of the Resource Assessment, it did not 
contain any estimates regarding the timing or cost to obtain commercial 
development. The accuracy of resource estimates is, in part, a function 
of the quality and quantity of available data and of engineering and 
geological interpretation and judgment. Given the data available at the 
time the Resource Assessment was prepared, the estimates presented 
therein are considered reasonable. The availability of additional data 
and analysis, after the date of the estimates, may necessitate 
revisions. These revisions may be material. There is no certainty that 
any portion of the resources will be discovered. If discovered, there is
 no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion
 of the resources.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advisory Regarding Forward-Looking Statements</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This news release 
contains certain statements which constitute forward-looking statements 
or information (“forward-looking statements”) including the discovery of
 resources in respect of the Jordan oil shale project and the commercial
 viability of producing any resources so discovered, the Company’s 
opinion that its preliminary feasibility work has not identified any 
unexpected technical challenges, that preliminary feasibility work 
suggests the project could be economic at current oil prices, the 
Company’s expectations of the timing and results from the Hatch 
integration study, the timing and decision to proceed to pre-FEED and 
FEED engineering, the Company’s plans to include this in the 
pre-development phase of a future concession agreement with the 
Jordanian government and its plans to apply for this concession 
agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forward-looking 
statements are based on a number of material factors, expectations or 
assumptions of Questerre which have been used to develop such statements
 and information, but which may prove to be incorrect. Although 
Questerre believes that the expectations reflected in these 
forward-looking statements are reasonable, undue reliance should not be 
placed on them because Questerre can give no assurance that they will 
prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements address future 
events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks 
and uncertainties. The Company choose to base their study on a 50,000 
barrel per day project, as that is the amount of production required to 
justify the cost of upgrading the product produced by the Company, such 
cost being factored into such feasibility study. There is nothing to 
indicate that this level of production will actually be achieved in 
respect of the Jordan oil shale project, as there is no history of 
production and no reserves have been attributed to such property. 
Although the Company believes that this assumption is reasonable in 
light of the current information available to it at this time, there is a
 significant risk that such level of production will not be achieved and
 that the estimated total capital and operating costs set forth above 
will not be achieved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further, events or 
circumstances may cause actual results to differ materially from those 
predicted as a result of numerous known and unknown risks, 
uncertainties, and other factors, many of which are beyond the control 
of the Company, including, without limitation: whether the Company's 
exploration and development activities respecting its prospects will be 
successful or that material volumes of petroleum and natural gas 
reserves will be encountered, or if encountered can be produced on a 
commercial basis; the ultimate size and scope of any hydrocarbon bearing
 formations on its lands; that drilling operations on its lands will be 
successful such that further development activities in these areas are 
warranted; that Questerre will continue to conduct its operations in a 
manner consistent with past operations; results from drilling and 
development activities will be consistent with past operations; the 
general stability of the economic and political environment in which 
Questerre operates; drilling results; field production rates and decline
 rates; the general continuance of current industry conditions; the 
timing and cost of pipeline, storage and facility construction and 
expansion and the ability of Questerre to secure adequate product 
transportation; future commodity prices; currency, exchange and interest
 rates; regulatory framework regarding royalties, taxes and 
environmental matters in the jurisdictions in which Questerre operates; 
and the ability of Questerre to successfully market its oil and natural 
gas products; changes in commodity prices; changes in the demand for or 
supply of the Company's products; unanticipated operating results or 
production declines; changes in tax or environmental laws, changes in 
development plans of Questerre or by third party operators of 
Questerre's properties, increased debt levels or debt service 
requirements; inaccurate estimation of Questerre's oil and gas reserve 
and resource volumes; limited, unfavourable or a lack of access to 
capital markets; increased costs; a lack of adequate insurance coverage;

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resource Definitions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resources encompasses all
 petroleum quantities that originally existed on or within the earth's 
crust in naturally occurring accumulations, including Discovered and 
Undiscovered (recoverable and unrecoverable) plus quantities already 
produced. "Total resources" is equivalent to "Total Petroleum Initially 
In Place". Resources are classified in the following categories:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total Petroleum Initially
 In Place ("TPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is estimated to 
exist originally in naturally occurring accumulations. It includes that 
quantity of petroleum that is estimated, as of a given date, to be 
contained in known accumulations, prior to production, plus those 
estimated quantities in accumulations yet to be discovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovered Petroleum 
Initially In Place ("DPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is 
estimated, as of a given date, to be contained in known accumulations 
prior to production. The recoverable portion of discovered petroleum 
initially in place includes production, reserves, and Contingent 
Resources; the remainder is unrecoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources are 
those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established 
technology or technology under development but which are not currently 
considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more 
contingencies. Economic Contingent Resources (“ECR”) are those 
contingent resources that are currently economically recoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undiscovered Petroleum 
Initially In Place ("UPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is 
estimated, on a given date, to be contained in accumulations yet to be 
discovered. The recoverable portion of undiscovered petroleum initially 
in place is referred to as "prospective resources" and the remainder as 
"unrecoverable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective Resources are
 those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application 
of future development projects. Prospective resources have both an 
associated chance of discovery and a chance of development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unrecoverable is that 
portion of DPIIP and UPIIP quantities which is estimated, as of a given 
date, not to be recoverable by future development projects. A portion of
 these quantities may become recoverable in the future as commercial 
circumstances change or technological developments occur; the remaining 
portion may never be recovered due to the physical/chemical constraints 
represented by subsurface interaction of fluids and reservoir rocks. 
Uncertainty Ranges are described by the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation 
Handbook as low, best, and high estimates for reserves and resources as 
follows:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low Estimate: This is 
considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities
 recovered will exceed the low estimate. If probabilistic methods are 
used, there should be at least a 90 percent probability (P90) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the low estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best Estimate: This is 
considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will actually be
 recovered. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities 
recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate. If 
probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50 percent 
probability (P50) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or 
exceed the best estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High Estimate: This is 
considered to be an optimistic estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual remaining 
quantities recovered will exceed the high estimate. If probabilistic 
methods are used, there should be at least a 10 percent probability 
(P10) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the 
high estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certain resource estimate
 volumes disclosed herein are arithmetic sums of multiple estimates of 
DPIIP, which statistical principles indicate may be misleading as to 
volumes that may actually be recovered. Readers should give attention to
 the estimates of individual classes of resources and appreciate the 
differing probabilities of recovery associated with each class as 
explained under this Resource Definitions section.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's
 New Democratic government introduced its 2018-19 budget last week, and 
it is likely to be a pivotal moment for the grand and indubitably noble 
cause of democratic socialism, or social democracy, or whatever we're 
calling it now, in Alberta. Our next provincial election is supposed to 
happen, by statute, next spring - "on or before" May 31. If that is how 
things pan out, the New Democrats will get to introduce, and in theory 
run behind, an election budget. But in the meantime, a full year of 
campaigning will have taken place, and will have been conducted on the 
basis of last week's budget.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One
 of the key themes will be carbon taxation. In arguments about the 
Alberta carbon tax, the design of the actual instrument has mostly been 
beside the point until now. The whole idea of taxing carbon, as such, 
strikes at the heart of Alberta's cultural self-identification: to many 
Albertans, raised on tales of Leduc No. 1 and the National <b>Energy</b> Program and the Heritage Fund, it is morally offensive in itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta is about 
hydrocarbons in sort of the same deep sense in which Quebec can be 
thought of as being "about" the French language. An Alberta carbon tax 
(a pioneering, world-leading one!) was always going to play, with large 
Alberta audiences, as an act of hysterical self-mortification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP had to know that 
there would be an inherent political price to be paid for its approach -
 that its carbon policy would, for some Albertans, be altogether beyond 
rational discussion. But nobody should underestimate the number of 
Albertans who are at the far opposite end of this spectrum - equally 
beyond reason in the other direction. A lot of Albertans hate that 
Alberta is about hydrocarbons: they go about in a state of constant 
low-level eco-spleen. Almost certainly the business of 
hydrocarbon-digging brought their parents here, or their grandparents, 
but they have grown up with endless propaganda about the 
species'planet-killing error of ever using fossil fuels, and they 
naturally feel trapped or swindled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP's carbon tax 
rhetoric was designed to appeal to those who lie between these two poles
 of irrationality. The United Conservatives have already spent a lot of 
time heckling the New Democrats over their implied promise that a carbon
 tax would provide <b>social license</b> for pipeline projects that 
might help Alberta realize un-discounted world prices for ecologically 
laundered oil. The preferred rebuttal of carbon tax advocates is that "<b>social license</b>"
 is actually oil-industry jargon. But there can be no doubt that the 
carbon tax was designed, and politically marketed, on the basis of 
reputational benefits that have not yet panned out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Rachel Notley has talked a pretty good game about Alberta deserving to 
benefit from appropriately taxed carbon-grubbing, but the UCP can show 
that her caucus and her braintrust are full of former Splenetics who 
used to wave handmade protest signs about Dirty Oil. The fallback 
argument, for the NDP, is that the carbon tax is a worthwhile incentive 
in itself. The point is not merely to hoover up new revenue, but simply 
to price, and thereby discourage, carbon pollution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be useful for 
the NDP to show, in making this argument, that the tax was wholly 
revenue-neutral - that it was not being used to increase the size of 
government, but was being given back to Albertans. The 2018-19 budget 
makes that part of the case more complicated for them. Under the new 
implied provincial price of $30 per ton of carbon emitted, the revenues 
from carbon taxation are expected to come to about $1.4 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only $525 million of that
 will be handed back to Alberta taxpayers directly, in rebate cheques to
 lower-income households. The government intends to spend more than 
what's left over from that revenue - over a billion dollars - on 
carbonabatement projects under the Climate Leadership Plan. Close to 
half will go to public transit and other public infrastructure; over 
$200 million will be used to support coal towns being annihilated by the
 decarbonization of Alberta electricity; some of it will go to favoured 
"clean tech" researchers and businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New Democratic 
narrative will be that this should not really count as a tax grab, 
because the money, having most definitely been grabbed, is to be 
"reinvested" within Alberta. But if the most important point of the 
carbon tax was the price incentive, the NDP could have cut other taxes 
to make it truly revenue-neutral. It could even have provided a bigger, 
even more progressive cash rebate that wasn't a mere fraction of the 
revenue yield. (Mind you, I am aware of no leftist radical anywhere who 
is criticizing the Alberta carbon tax on this basis.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's worse, the federal
 government's umbrella carbon tax plan will increase the implied carbon 
price to $40 a ton in 2021, while passing the money along to Alberta, 
and the NDP's fiscal plan admits that, if it is still in charge, it will
 keep the additional money for use in "general revenue." If you're a 
middle-ground Albertan who is comfortable with a carbon tax as a 
concept, what do you have left to say to anyone who warned that such a 
tax could easily be increased, and might become another way of stiffing 
the taxpayer and increasing government expenditure? This is a surrender 
of moral high ground to essentially religious procarbon sentiment: those
 zanies, it seems, warned us of a millennium that is arriving fast.</p>

Pulse has initiated Phase 1 of the Bigoray Nisku Pinnacle Reef Enhanced 
Oil Recovery ("EOR") project in the Bigoray area of Alberta ("Bigoray").</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As previously announced on January 9, 2018, and as summarized below, <span class="companylink">Sproule Associates Limited</span>
 ("Sproule"), an independent qualified reserves evaluator, completed an 
independent resource assessment that includes the Bigoray EOR project 
potential only, and is in addition to the previously disclosed baseline 
independently assessed reserves in the Company's core areas at Bigoray 
and Queenstown.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sproule
 assessed a best estimate Discovered Petroleum Initially in-Place (PIIP)
 of 23.292 million barrels of oil ("boe") within Pulse's 100% controlled
 Nisku D and Nisku E Pools, which Pulse views as conservative, given the
 Alberta Regulator lists PIIP as 26.51 million boe's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Resource Assessment 
was prepared in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 –Standards of
 Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities&nbsp;of the Canadian Securities 
Administrators ("NI 51-101") and the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation 
Handbook ("COGE Handbook").</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more information on the Sproule independent resource assessment, please see "Independent Resource Assessment Details" below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulse also announces the 
appointment of a Bigoray EOR Project Manager, Bill Sawchuk, a 
Professional Petroleum Engineer and an EOR expert to oversee all 
technical and planning aspects of the EOR program. With over 20 years 
of&nbsp;experience as a senior engineering manager and a technical 
expert in reservoir engineering and enhanced oil recovery methods. Bill 
has previously served as an Exploitation Engineer for Anderson 
Exploration Ltd. and <span class="companylink">Devon Canada Corporation</span>
 and most recently, as Manager of Engineering for ARC Resources Ltd. 
where he led teams to optimize production and implement valuable 
Enhanced Oil Recovery projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulse is excited that 
initial critical facility aspects of the Bigoray EOR project are now 
underway, using working capital on hand in preparation for the EOR 
Injection Phase to be implemented in 2018 as planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phase 1 of the EOR 
project ("Phase 1"), which includes re-activation of existing injection 
facilities, will also allow Pulse to cost-effectively reactivate up to 3
 current shut-in oil producers to add approximately 400 BOE/d (100% 
working interest) of new light oil and gas production prior to the EOR 
project taking place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Cadenhead, President
 and COO of Pulse Oil, commented, "We are eagerly awaiting the Bigoray 
EOR project to be fully underway later this year and the start of Phase 1
 is a very low-cost starting point; it's really exciting for everyone 
involved.&nbsp; This critical facility work not only marks the start of 
the EOR project for us, it allows us to get additional shut-in 
production re-activated in the near-term while we prepare for the water 
injection phase of the project in 2018. This interim production boost 
will provide additional revenues which will be reinvested in the Bigoray
 EOR program later this year as planned."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Independent Resource Assessment Details:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sproule Independent 
Resource Assessment provides estimates categorized as "high", "best" and
 "low" for contingent resources associated with the Bigoray EOR project 
on the two pools, with the unrisked high estimate being 8.07 million boe
 (92.6% Oil), a best estimate of 6.136 million boe (91.3% Oil) and a low
 estimate of 3.668 million boe (89.1% Oil).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, the 
Resource Assessment prepared by Sproule calculated risked contingent 
resources where the risked assessment assigned a 77% chance of Pulse 
proceeding with the EOR project (see Table 2 below) and resulting in a 
best estimate of risked contingent resources net to Pulse of 4.694 
million boe (91.2% Oil).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Cadenhead, President
 and COO of Pulse Oil, commented, "The Sproule Resource Assessment is a 
positive independent commercial confirmation for our Bigoray Nisku 
Enhanced Oil Recovery project. Although this assessment used a more 
conservative approach to Petroleum Initially in-Place ("PIIP") compared 
with the PIIP estimates of the Alberta <b>Energy</b> Regulator, we are 
excited to see that even this more conservative approach resulted in a 
strong endorsement for the project. With an independent un-risked high 
case upside estimated at over 8 million boe's of contingent resources 
(92% oil), the opportunity to move forward with our EOR project to bring
 on stream substantial cashflow while targeting to recover those types 
of oil volumes without drilling a well, creates a substantial 
opportunity to enhance value for Pulse and our shareholders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Resource Assessment 
focussed exclusively on two Nisku pools only in the Bigoray area, and 
included just 2,720 acres of Pulse's 44,720 acre core area holdings 
which includes 14,000 acres at Bigoray alone. Future evaluations may be 
done on Pulse's Mannville, Cardium and Pekisko formations that are 
thought to also provide significant growth opportunities for the Company
 as well as additional Nisku assets/pools held within Pulse's existing 
holdings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cadenhead further 
added, "As part of the Resource Assessment, the evaluator assessed a 
total risk of 77% that the project would proceed, citing economic 
factors and/or timing of development as one of the only risks associated
 with the project. All technical risks such as&nbsp;evaluation drilling,
 regulatory approvals, technology, legal factors, infrastructure and 
markets, political factors and social licence were all assigned 100% 
chance of commerciality.&nbsp;Our goal is to make this project happen in
 2018 and with the oil prices holding firmly above US$60 WTI pricing, 
the economics of this EOR project and return for shareholders continue 
to look more and more attractive alongside improving oil prices." 
&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Resource Assessment 
is based on the results from seventeen wells and, where available, core 
data. Where core was not available, the assessment considered log data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resource 
volumes for these discovered resources have been classified as 
'development unclarified' with Sproule assessing that there is a high 
probability of the Bigoray EOR project becoming a commercial 
development. Pulse will continue to complete project planning associated
 with the project and move forward with its execution plans in 
2018.&nbsp;</p>

market. Significant negative factors relevant to the estimate of Pulse's
 contingent resources from the Bigoray EOR project include uncertainty 
to how the previously fully waterflooded pools will respond to a 
miscible flood, economic viability uncertainty, as project capital and 
operating costs are unclear and areal uncertainties in the estimation of
 PIIP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About <span class="companylink">Pulse Oil Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulse is a Canadian 
company incorporated Under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta) and 
has plans to become a leading oil and gas company. Pulse has recently 
completed four transactions to consolidate its interests in the Bigoray 
area of Alberta, resulting in 100% control of Pulse's Bigoray operations
 that include two Nisku oil Pinnacle Reefs. Pulse is moving forward to 
grow production and execute an Enhanced Oil Recovery project to unlock 
significant value for shareholders through control of approximately 65 
net sections of land across the Mannville, Cardium, Pekisko/Shunda and 
Nisku trends in Western Canada.&nbsp;Pulse will focus on acquiring 
affordable, small to medium sized proven oil and gas assets with 
significant upside. The Company plans to achieve further growth through 
low-risk, technically diligent drilling, infrastructure ownership and 
reserve growth utilizing proven enhanced oil recovery techniques and 
implementation of technology.</p>

oil.&nbsp;Boes may be misleading, particularly if used in 
isolation.&nbsp;A boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf:1 bbl (barrel) is based 
on an <b>energy</b> equivalency conversion method primarily applicable 
at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resource Definitions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resources encompasses all
 petroleum quantities that originally existed on or within the earth's 
crust in naturally occurring accumulations, including Discovered and 
Undiscovered (recoverable and unrecoverable) plus quantities already 
produced. "Total Resources" is equivalent to "Total Petroleum Initially 
In-Place". Resources are classified in the following categories:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total Petroleum Initially
 In-Place ("TPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is estimated to 
exist originally in naturally occurring accumulations. It includes that 
quantity of petroleum that is estimated, as of a given date, to be 
contained in known accumulations, prior to production, plus those 
estimated quantities in accumulations yet to be discovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovered Petroleum 
Initially In-Place ("DPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is 
estimated, as of a given date, to be contained in known accumulations 
prior to production. The recoverable portion of DPIIP includes 
production, reserves, and Contingent Resources; the remainder is 
unrecoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources are 
those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established 
technology or technology under development but which are not currently 
considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more 
contingencies. Economic Contingent Resources (ECR) are those contingent 
resources that are currently economically recoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undiscovered Petroleum 
Initially In Place ("UPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is 
estimated, on a given date, to be contained in accumulations yet to be 
discovered. The recoverable portion of UPIIP is referred to as 
Prospective Resources and the remainder is unrecoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective Resources are
 those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application 
of future development projects. Prospective Resources have both an 
associated chance of discovery and a chance of development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unrecoverable is that 
portion of DPIIP and UPIIP quantities which is estimated, as of a given 
date, not to be recoverable by future development projects. A portion of
 these quantities may become recoverable in the future as commercial 
circumstances change or technological developments occur; the remaining 
portion may never be recovered due to the physical/chemical constraints 
represented by subsurface interaction of fluids and reservoir rocks. 
Uncertainty Ranges are described by the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation 
Handbook as low, best, and high estimates for reserves and resources as 
follows:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low Estimate: This is 
considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities
 recovered will exceed the low estimate. If probabilistic methods are 
used, there should be at least a 90 percent probability (P90) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the low estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best Estimate: This is 
considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will actually be
 recovered. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities 
recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate. If 
probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50 percent 
probability (P50) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or 
exceed the best estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High Estimate: This is 
considered to be an optimistic estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual remaining 
quantities recovered will exceed the high estimate. If probabilistic 
methods are used, there should be at least a 10 percent probability 
(P10) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the 
high estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development Unclarified 
is a project maturity sub-class of contingent resources that refers to 
the development plan evaluation is not complete and there is ongoing 
activity to resolve any risks or uncertainties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certain resource estimate
 volumes disclosed herein are arithmetic sums of multiple estimates of 
DPIIP or UPIIP, which statistical principles indicate may be misleading 
as to volumes that may actually be recovered. Readers should give 
attention to the estimates of individual classes of resources and 
appreciate the differing probabilities of recovery associated with each 
class as explained under this&nbsp;Resource Definitions&nbsp;section.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 throne speech that marked the opening of the legislature earlier this 
month was clearly aimed at more than just Albertans. One of its key 
themes was the need to get our oil to tidewater, where it will fetch a 
higher price than fuel sold to the United States, which is where the 
great majority of our <b>energy</b> is exported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The speech, read by 
Lt.-Gov. Lois Mitchell, had British Columbians in mind; in particular, 
Premier John Horgan, who has voiced strong opposition to the Trans 
Mountain pipeline.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The
 dispute British Columbia triggered with its attack on Canadian workers 
will not stand," the government said in the speech. "We won't let it. We
 have been vigilant in defending our workers and we will remain 
vigilant."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a well-crafted 
message, but when the government's budget is released Thursday 
afternoon, the Rachel Notley government must ensure Albertans' interests
 are at the heart of its fiscal blueprint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since coming to power in 
2015, the NPD has posted irresponsible deficits. Its predecessor, the 
Conservative party, also failed to balance the books under successive 
premiers, but there was nothing like the NDP has done in the supposed 
defence of front-line services such as health care and education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP has spent 
taxpayer money with abandon, to the point that credit agencies, which 
determine how much Albertans will pay in interest on the massive amount 
of borrowing, have downgraded the province's rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP is clearly an 
ally of the organized labour movement, but it needs to expand its reach 
and popularity if it hopes to win reelection next spring. Many Albertans
 are seeking some financial prudence as opposed to the spending 
free-for-all we've been witness to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worryingly, that's not 
likely to be the case when Thursday's budget is revealed. Finance 
Minister Joe Ceci said Tuesday that the document will include 
anticipated revenue from expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, 
apparently with the aim of balancing the budget within five years - well
 after the next election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No sensible homeowner 
would cobble together a budget with the assumption they'd be getting a 
pay increase in a few years. And yet this is what passes for NDP 
mathematics - the hope that having imposed a punitive carbon tax on its 
citizens to win so-called <b>social license</b> for pipelines, that politicians who are indifferent to <b>energy</b> infrastructure, or openly oppose them, are going to facilitate the flow of billions of dollars into Alberta's coffers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP have proven to be
 poor money managers, but surely we're not to have faith in such wild 
speculation. Opposition Leader Jason Kenney sees the danger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We obviously hope that 
Trans Mountain gets built quickly, but what we've seen is a year of 
delays already and the very strong potential of yet further delays," 
said the United Conservative Party leader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is putting a lot of eggs in one uncertain basket, and that's not how you budget."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government should 
focus instead on reducing costs. Last year's budget projected that by 
2020, Alberta's debt will be $70 billion - which is the equivalent of 
$16,500 for every person in the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists Janice 
MacKinnon and Jack Mintz argue that Alberta can learn lessons from other
 provinces, such as Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia, which spent an
 average of $9,233 per capita last year on services. Alberta spent 
$12,409 per person - that's $3,176 more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In health care alone, 
they note, Alberta spends $915 more per capita than the average of the 
other three large provinces, which means spending $3.8 billion more 
annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP shouldn't put 
revenue from incompleted pipelines in its ledgers. It should engage in 
the thoughtful work Albertans elected them to do and focus on reducing 
expenses.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last
 week in the Legislature under the leadership of United Conservative 
Leader Jason Kenney Albertans learned that their government has no 
definitive ceiling in mind for the carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taking true leadership by
 seeking definitive answers, Jason Kenney proposed legislation that 
would prevent any further carbon tax hikes without the approval of 
Albertans through a referendum vote. Similar to Ralph Klein's approach 
on a provincial sales tax, Kenney wants Albertans to determine their own
 economic future in a democratic fashion.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney
 tried to make the Premier and ministers come clean about future plans 
to further raise their job-killing carbon tax. Similar to the approach 
the NDP used shortly after being elected in 2015, they've chosen not to 
include Albertans in the decision to implement new taxes or new tax 
strategies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">United Conservatives are 
committed to holding the government to account and protect Albertans 
best interests. It is imperative that to fulfill our role as advocates 
for Albertans, we dig deep to determine where the government is headed 
and to keep Albertans properly informed of the government's intentions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prior to being elected, 
the NDP did not disclose their true intentions of creating a tax on 
everything by way of the carbon tax. It even appears that their own 
party faithful were painfully unaware of their intent. Now when asked in
 the Legislature, they have no intentions of disclosing how high they 
intend on taking their economically unsound plan for Alberta's future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real issue with this 
government comes down to trust. What a government says is just as 
important as what it doesn't say. Not disclosing or otherwise 
intentionally omitting details creates an atmosphere of mistrust and 
that's just how constituents of Drumheller- Stettler who I have spoken 
to are feeling about the carbon tax and the NDP's failed <b>social license</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also troubling that 
when pressed for answers into the allocation of the funds collected and 
how the NDP Government has reduced Alberta's carbon output, there is 
little to no information disclosed. In search of more answers, Calgary 
Foothills MLA and <b>Energy</b> Critic, Prasad Panda asked, "how much is the government paying to the <span class="companylink">Balancing Pool</span>
 to cover the purchase of these carbon offset credits? What's the secret
 number?" (Hansard March 12th, 2018) The rhetoric coming from the 
government side of the Legislature on their carbon tax and failed <b>social license</b>
 inevitably ends with accusations of "climate denial" that is a 
"dead-end for Alberta." (HansardMarch 12th, 2018). Albertans are quickly
 realizing that the only dead-end is a taxation plan that scares away 
investors and jobs, and create consequences for those who can least 
afford it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Albertans deserve better,
 they deserve full disclosure about where their government is going 
prior to being elected, anything short of that is just broken trust.</p>

 Notes:
 
 (1)   Contingent Resources are estimates of volumes that are potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established technology or technology under development, but which are not currently considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more contingencies.
 
 (2)   The volumes reported here are “risked” in the sense that they have been adjusted for chance of development. The chance of development is defined as the probability of a project being commercially viable. Quantifying the chance of development requires consideration of both economic contingencies and other contingencies, such as legal, regulatory, market access, political, <b>social license</b>, internal and external approvals and commitment to project finance and development timing. As many of these factors are extremely difficult to quantify, the chance of development is uncertain and must be used with caution. ERCE determined that a 70 percent chance of development is appropriate for the Contingent Resources.
 
 (3)   Gross Contingent Resources are all volumes estimated to be recoverable from the field without any economic cut-off being applied. Gross Weight Interest Contingent Resources is adjusted for the Company’s 80% working interest fraction of the Gross Contingent Resources. Net Contingent Resources are adjusted for the Company’s working interest share after deduction of royalty obligations.
 
 (4)   Project maturity for Contingent Resources has been classified as Development Unclarified.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company has mapped a 
significant structural closure at Miocene level at a depth of between 
4,000 and 4,500 metres (subsea) based on 3D seismic. The prospective 
horizon is located beneath the oil producing reservoirs of the Gum Deniz
 Oil Field and this horizon has not yet been penetrated by a well in the
 Bahar purchase and sale agreement. The Company is also monitoring the 
drilling of the Absheron Operating Company (AOC) Miocene well test which
 is located approximately 4 km north east of the Bahar Project. The well
 is being drilled from the same surface location as the 2015 Hovsan 1870

 Notes:
 
 (1)  The above table has been disclosed consistent with the classification and reporting requirements of PRMS. 
 
 (2)  “Gross Unrisked Prospective Resources” are all volumes estimated to be recoverable from an accumulation. There is no equivalent COGEH definition.
 
 (3)  “Net Unrisked Prospective Resources” are the Company’s working interest fraction of the Gross Unrisked Prospective Resources. The equivalent COGEH definition disclosed below is “Gross Working Interest Prospective Resources” which is the Company’s working interest fraction in Prospective Resources prior to the deduction of royalties. 
 
 (4)  “Net Risked Prospective Resources” are the Company’s working interest fraction of the Net Unrisked Prospective Resources multiplied by the geological chance of success (“COS”).  The COS is an estimate of the probability that drilling the prospect would result in a discovery as defined under PRMS. ERCE has assigned a chance of success of 32% to the Prospective Resources. Under COGEH, prospective resources are risked by a chance of commerciality, being the product of the chance of development and the chance of discovery. For further detail, see below notes (2)-(4) of the table entitled “Prospective Resources, Gum Deniz Miocene Prospect”.
 
 (5)  Prospective Resources reported here are both “unrisked” in that they have not been multiplied by the COS and “risked” in that the volumes have been multiplied by the COS.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The primary factors 
contributing to lower than expected production were: (i) the slower pace
 of executing scheduled workovers, reflecting, in part, limited access 
to heavy lift vessels; (ii) the lower than expected post-workover 
production rates; and (iii) the slow pace of south Gum Deniz Electric 
Submersible Pumps (ESP) installations as workovers in old wellbores 
required additional cleaning and scraping runs. The Corporation plans to
 address the limited access to heavy lift vessels through the 
acquisition of a heavier rig that is better suited to deal with the 
challenges imposed by the old wells and difficult workovers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, Bahar <b>Energy</b>
 Operating Company Limited elected to defer both capital and operating 
expenditures until the development plan and reservoir studies were 
completed which would further facilitate the delineation and selection 
of the best projects going forward. The reservoir studies were initially
 expected to be completed by April of 2017, in respect of the gas field,
 and by midyear 2017, in respect of the oil field. However, the studies 
were not completed until Q1 2018 as a result of the identification of 
development opportunities (particularly waterfloods), additional 
evaluation work requested by the reserve auditors (<span class="companylink">GLJ Petroleum Consultants</span>
 and ERCE), and data inconsistencies resulting from scribed logs and 
well files that required clarification and further delineation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In light of lower than 
expected production, the Company revised its 2017 budget, resulting in 
downward adjustments to capital expenditures to $9.7 million (from 
guidance of USD$21 million) and operating expenses to $23 million (from 
guidance of USD$28 million). The deferral of projected expenditures 
intended to increase gross lease production from 4,167 boe/d at December
 31, 2016 resulted in the realization of approximately 24% less revenue 
than originally expected by the Company.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disclosure of Oil and Gas Information</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Information Regarding 
Disclosure on Oil and Gas Resources. The resources data set forth above 
is based upon an independent resource assessment and evaluation prepared
 by ERCE with an effective date of March 2, 2018. The resources were 
evaluated in accordance with the standards contained in the Canadian Oil
 and Gas Evaluation Handbook and the resource definitions contained in 
NI 51-101, and consistent with the classification and reporting 
requirements of PRMS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OOIP Disclosure. The term
 original-oil-in-place (“OOIP”) is equivalent to total petroleum 
initially-in-place (“TPIIP”). TPIIP, as defined in the Canadian Oil and 
Gas Evaluation Handbook, is that quantity of petroleum that is estimated
 to exist in naturally occurring accumulations. It includes that 
quantity of petroleum that is estimated, as of a given date, to be 
contained in known accumulations, prior to production, plus those 
estimated quantities in accumulations yet to be discovered. A portion of
 the TPIIP is considered undiscovered and there is no certainty that any
 portion of such undiscovered resources will be discovered. If 
discovered, there is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to
 produce any portion of such undiscovered resources. With respect to the
 portion of the TPIIP that is considered discovered resources, there is 
no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion 
of such discovered resources. A significant portion of the estimated 
volumes of TPIIP will never be recovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOE Disclosure. For the 
purpose of calculating unit costs, natural gas volumes have been 
converted to a boe using six thousand cubic feet equal to one barrel 
unless otherwise stated. A boe conversion ratio of 6:1 is based upon an <b>energy</b>
 equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip 
and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. This 
conversion conforms to NI 51-101. Boe may be misleading, particularly if
 used in isolation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources and 
Prospective Resources. Contingent resources are the quantities of 
petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable 
from known accumulations using established technology or technology 
underdevelopment, but which are not currently considered to be 
commercially recoverable due to one or more contingencies. Contingencies
 are conditions that must be satisfied for a portion of contingent 
resources to be classified as reserves that are: (a) specific to the 
project being evaluated; and (b) expected to be resolved within a 
reasonable timeframe. Contingencies may include factors such as 
economic, legal, environmental, political and regulatory matters or a 
lack of markets. It is also appropriate to classify as contingent 
resources the estimated discovered recoverable quantities associated 
with a project in the early evaluation stage.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective Resources are
 those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application 
of future development projects. Prospective resources have both an 
associated chance of discovery and a chance of development. Not all 
exploration projects will result in discoveries. The chance that an 
exploration project will result in the discovery of petroleum is 
referred to as the chance of discovery. Thus, for an undiscovered 
accumulation the chance of commerciality is the product of two risk 
components-the chance of discovery and the chance of development. There 
is no certainty that any portion of the Prospective Resources will be 
discovered. If discovered, there is no certainty that it will be 
commercially viable to produce any portion of the Prospective Resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estimates of the 
Contingent Resources and Prospective Resources are based upon the report
 prepared by ERCE, the Company’s independent qualified resources 
evaluators, effective as of March 2, 2018. The estimates of Contingent 
Resources and Prospective Resources provided in this press release are 
estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated Contingent 
Resources and Prospective Resources will be recovered. Actual contingent
 and prospective resources may be greater than or less than the 
estimates provided in this in this press release and the differences may
 be material. There is no certainty that any portion of the Prospective 
Resources will be discovered. If discovered, there is no certainty that 
it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the Prospective
 Resources. There is also uncertainty that it will be commercially 
viable to produce any part of the Contingent Resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estimates of contingent 
and prospective resources are by their nature more speculative than 
estimates of proved reserves and would require substantial capital 
spending over a significant number of years to implement recovery. 
Actual locations drilled and quantities that may be ultimately recovered
 from our properties will differ substantially. In addition, we have 
made no commitment to drill, and likely will not drill, all of the 
drilling locations that have been attributable to these quantities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective resources 
estimates that are referred to herein are risked as to both chance of 
discovery and chance of development and both risked and unrisked to the 
COS under PRMS. Contingent resources estimates that are referred to 
herein are both risked and risked as to chance of development. Risks 
that could impact the chance of discovery and chance of development 
include, without limitation: geological uncertainty and uncertainty 
regarding individual well drainage areas; uncertainty regarding the 
consistency of productivity that may be achieved from lands with 
attributed resources; potential delays in development due to product 
prices, access to capital, availability of markets and/or take-away 
capacity; and uncertainty regarding potential flow rates from wells and 
the economics of those wells. Risk assessment is a highly subjective 
process dependent upon the experience and judgment of the evaluators and
 is subject to revision with further data acquisition or interpretation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The following classification of contingent and prospective resources is used in the press release:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Low Estimate (or 1C) 
means there is at least a 90 percent probability (P90) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the low estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Best Estimate (or 2C) 
means there is at least a 50 percent probability (P50) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the best estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* High Estimate (or 3C) 
means there is at least a 10 percent probability (P10) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the high estimate. In
 general, the significant factors that may change the Contingent 
Resources estimates include further delineation drilling, which could 
change the estimates either positively or negatively, future technology 
improvements, which would positively affect the estimates, and 
additional processing capacity that could affect the volumes recoverable
 or type of production. Additional facility design work, development 
plans, and reservoir studies are expected to be completed by Greenfields
 in accordance with its long-term resource development plan.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This press release 
contains forward-looking statements. More particularly, this press 
release may include, but is not limited to, statements concerning: the 
planned acquisition of oil and gas assets; the Company’s ability to grow
 in both the near and long term and the funding of our growth 
opportunities; estimated resources; the Company’s prospects and leads; 
and the future development of the Company’s business. Statements 
respecting contingent resources and prospective resources are 
forward-looking statements as they involve the implied assessment, based
 on estimates and assumptions, that the Contingent Resources and 
Prospective Resources described exist in the quantities predicted or 
estimated and can be profitably produced in the future. In addition, the
 use of any of the words “can”, “will”, “estimate”, “long term”, 
“anticipate”, “believe”, “should”, “forecast”, “future”, “continue”, 
“may”, “expect”, and similar expressions are intended to identify 
forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained 
herein are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by the
 Company, including, but not limited to, expectations and assumptions 
concerning the accuracy of resources estimates, that the Company will 
continue to conduct its operations in a manner consistent with its 
current expectations, the availability of required equipment and 
services, the extent and effect of delivery disruptions, and the general
 continuance of current or, where applicable, assumed operational, 
regulatory and industry conditions including in areas of potential 
expansion, and the ability of Greenfields to execute its current 
business and operational plans in the manner currently planned. Although
 the Company believes that the expectations and assumptions on which the
 forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, undue reliance 
should not be placed on the forward-looking statements because the 
Company can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Prasad Panda</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there's one thing I 
hope all Albertans can agree on, it's the desperate need for more 
pipelines to get our abundant oil and gas resources to market. According
 to recent reports, Alberta is losing $7 billion per year because of 
lack of pipeline capacity, with industry losing $6.7 billion more 
annually.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While
 we disagree with how the NDP has handled the strategy surrounding the 
Trans Mountain expansion, we don't doubt the need for the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't that long ago 
when pipelines were built in this country with little controversy. Under
 the previous Harper government, four major pipeline projects were 
completed. Keystone, Alberta Clipper, the Line 9 reversal and Anchor 
Loop were all successfully completed under the previous government, 
adding 1.73 million barrels per day of capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, it is true that none
 of these projects were to tidewater, as the NDP is happy to point out. 
But Trans Mountain was not up for government approval under the previous
 Conservative government. The NDP's cousins in Ottawa would no doubt 
have howled with outrage if the Harper government dared to short circuit
 the regulatory process by approving a pipeline before a thorough review
 was completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northern Gateway, the one
 tidewater pipeline up for decision under the Harper Conservatives, was 
indeed approved. Sadly, the project was retroactively cancelled by the 
Trudeau Liberals as part of their plan to ban tanker traffic off B.C.'s 
northern coast (never mind that Alaskan tankers have travelled down that
 route for decades). And the Trudeau Liberals later rigged the approval 
process midstream to scuttle <b>Energy</b> East, another pipeline to tidewater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, radical 
activists have engaged in a concerted effort to specifically target and 
sideline Canada's oil and gas industry, viewing us as ripe for the 
picking. Millions of dollars of foreign funding have flooded into the 
Canadian environmental movement with the clear goal of starving our 
resources of markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta NDP government promised that imposing a carbon tax on Albertans would buy so-called <b>social license</b>
 in B.C. for a pipeline to the Pacific. We are baffled that the Alberta 
government bought this specious argument, since it's their fellow 
travellers - both the B.C. NDP and radical environmental activists such 
as Tzeporah Berman - who are leading the fight against the approved 
Trans Mountain expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surely, the Alberta NDP 
understood that their friends would not be willing to trade a carbon tax
 for a pipeline. In fact, Premier Rachel Notley finally acknowledged 
this reality in a recent interview with <span class="companylink">CBC Radio</span>.
 When asked why not put a hold on the carbon tax until the pipeline 
begins construction, she responded, "quite honestly, I don't know that 
B.C. would care one way or another if we did that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The truth is that the 
Trudeau Liberals provided paper regulatory approval for the pipeline, 
purportedly because of Alberta's willingness to impose a carbon tax on 
its citizens. Yet today, the Trudeau Liberals are willing to do little 
beyond rhetoric to fight for Trans Mountain in the face of vociferous 
opposition in B.C., hurting the 51 First Nations that have signed off in
 support of the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's in all Albertans 
interest to see this pipeline succeed. We in the United Conservative 
Party welcome the government's recent about face. After months mocking 
our suggestions to threaten the B.C. NDP with serious consequences, 
including potentially cutting off oil shipments and tolling B.C. natural
 gas, the premier has finally accepted our advice, albeit far too late.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We welcome a robust, 
serious debate on what's needed to get this pipeline built. But we 
should not be deluded into the fantasy that punitive taxes on everyday 
Albertans will appease the fringe yet extremely vocal anti-pipeline 
minority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, we must make it clear to the vast majority of reasonable Canadians that the success of our <b>energy</b> sector is critical for the success of our country, and that Alberta cannot be taken for granted any longer.</p>

 they might be ideologically opposed on various issues, right-of-centre 
Brad Wall, former Saskatchewan premier, is in “totally support” of 
left-leaning Alberta Premier Rachel Notley’s promise to do whatever it 
takes to see the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion come to fruition, 
even if it means shutting off the flow of oil and gas to B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That would get a lot of 
attention, as a last resort, if the people in the province of Alberta 
said: ‘Alright, we are going to try and show you just how important 
these pipelines are to you economically, and to the quality of life for 
B.C. and for the rest of the country,’” he told a Calgary Chamber of 
Commerce luncheon event on Monday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Just as a has-been premier, I would cheer from the sidelines if it needs to be done.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, during his 
speech and onstage Q&amp;A session with W.Brett Wilson, Wall also 
emphasized differences he has with Alberta’s NDP government, as well as 
with the current federal Liberal government. The long-time head of the 
conservative <span class="companylink">Saskatchewan Party</span> 
discussed his concerns regarding what he calls the “new left,” which 
seems to place matters such as (what he considers) ineffective carbon 
pricing ahead of government’s primary concern — the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The problem with this 
carbon tax is that you’d be hard pressed to find it working to actually 
reduce emissions, absolutely, where it is implemented. In our own 
country, it has been around since 2008 in the province next door, and 
their emissions are up. Now, B.C. would say: ‘Wait a minute. The 
intensity of the emissions is down.’ But [the Paris Agreement] isn’t 
about intensity of emissions; Paris is about absolute emissions 
reductions.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall’s presentation to 
the chamber was his first public address since leaving office following a
 decade as premier. Earlier this year, the governing party chose Scott 
Moe as Saskatchewan’s new premier (DOB, Jan. 29, 2018).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Wall, 
federal documents suggest the carbon tax must reach $200 per tonne for 
Canada to meet those Paris Agreement targets. While that would reduce 
emissions, he noted, such a price would do so only with widespread 
hardship through such results as many people being unable to afford to 
drive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That’s where the emperor has no clothes. That’s the discussion we need to have.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: “Federally, in 
terms of the economy priorities, we’ve seen a carbon-based budget, we’ve
 seen a gender-based budget, but I long for the day for our country when
 we see an economy-based budget.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall asks: What is <b>social license</b>?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever “<b>social license</b>” means, Wall believes the <b>energy</b> sector paid for it long ago, and industry does not require a carbon tax to justify its existence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was paid for in the 
transfer payments that were supported because of [Alberta’s] economy and
 ours,” he told reporters following this week’s chamber event. “It was 
paid for in jobs for Canadians from coast to coast to coast, and the 
quality of life implications of that. That’s <b>social license</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It has been paid for in 
meaningful land partnerships with First Nations, who built 
transformational businesses and created jobs because of this sector. All
 of this sounds like <b>social license</b> to me.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall believes this 
“self-immolation of a carbon tax” — whereby Alberta and Saskatchewan 
punish themselves because of their oil and gas assets — is ineffective 
anyway. It will not win support from those who are anti-industry, he 
said, as those individuals will still support ENGOs, they will still 
vote in accordance to their pre-carbon tax views, and they will still 
pressure their governments to act in accordance with anti-industry 
sentiments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If someone from B.C. or 
some other part of the country doesn’t like the oil and gas sector, the 
fact you implement a carbon tax is not going to change that person’s 
opinion.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: “This is something that has frustrated me since the very beginning.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technology to tackle climate change</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Focus on developing 
technology rather than on carbon pricing: That is Wall’s proposed 
‘made-in-Canada’ solution to man-made climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Could we as a country 
have a ‘man-to-the-moon’ sort of approach of finding a way to lower the 
cost of what we are already doing in [Saskatchewan] in terms of clean 
coal technology? That is our experience at home. The technology works; 
we have to drive the costs down. Isn’t it more important to do that and 
perhaps provide a technological solution that would actually reduce 
emissions?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the former 
premier, there are 2,000 coal plants being built around the world, 
principally in Asia, as countries such as India strive to grow their 
economies. He suggested carbon taxation has taken hold in Canada, in 
part, because various sectors of the economy hesitated to point out that
 pricing does not reduce absolute emissions, but it does have an impact 
on jobs. He challenges Canadians to stand up against ineffective policy 
that hurts competitiveness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In our province, it 
wasn’t good enough just to say we weren’t going to have a carbon tax. We
 unveiled in the fall our action plan on climate change, and it is a 
serious plan. It’s meaningful. It includes the possibility of a levy on 
high emitters, the likes of which you have had in Alberta.”</p>

 (“Questerre” or the “Company”) (TSX:QEC) (OSE:QEC) reported today on 
the results of its December 31, 2017 Reserves Assessment and Evaluation 
of its oil and natural gas properties (the “Report”), as evaluated by <span class="companylink">McDaniel &amp; Associates Consultants Ltd</span>.(“McDaniel”)
 with an effective date of December 31, 2017, prepared in accordance 
with the standards contained in the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation 
Handbook (the “COGE Handbook”) and National Instrument 51-101 – 
Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities ( “NI 51-101”).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Our 
reserve growth reflects the active drilling program at Kakwa this year 
and the light oil acquisition at Antler. Corporate proved and probable 
reserves gross reserves grew by 20% or 3.22 MMBoe from 15.7 MMBoe to 
18.41 MMBoe, net of production during the year. The before tax NPV-10% 
estimated for the corporate proved and probable reserves using 
McDaniel’s year-end price forecast is $174.70 million.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commenting on Questerre’s
 Utica resources in Quebec, he added, “The reserve engineers updated our
 resource report from last year for their current price forecast. The 
best estimate of risked contingent resources net to Questerre for the 
Becancour and Lotbiniere project areas is unchanged at 214 Bcf. These 
project areas as assessed only cover 5% of our total acreage. The risked
 net present value discounted at 10% before tax for this limited 
development area is $301 million compared to $311 million last year.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credit Facility</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company also reported
 on the status of its credit facility review that was conducted in the 
fourth quarter of 2017. The lender has advised that the primary credit 
facility will be renewed at $18 million. The facility will include a 
$17.9 million revolving operating demand facility (“Credit Facility A”).
 Credit Facility A can be used for general corporate purposes, ongoing 
operations and capital expenditures within Canada.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">December 31, 2017 Quebec Resource Information</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questerre also reported on the year-end update prepared by <span class="companylink">GLJ Petroleum Consultants Ltd</span>.
 (“GLJ”) to the independent resource assessment of its 735,910 gross 
(190,800 net) acres in the St. Lawrence Lowlands Quebec that have 
potential for the Upper Utica Shale effective December 31, 2017 in a 
report dated March 5, 2018 (the “GLJ Resource Assessment”). The GLJ 
Resource Assessment was prepared in accordance with NI 51-101 and the 
standards contained in the COGE Handbook. The GLJ Resource Assessment 
did not include any of the Corporation’s other properties. All 
anticipated results disclosed herein were prepared by GLJ, which is an 
independent qualified reserves evaluator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GLJ used probabilistic 
methods to generate low, best and high estimates of total petroleum 
initially in-place ("TPIIP"), both discovered and undiscovered. 
Recoverable Contingent and Prospective Resources over Questerre's 
acreage were estimated by analogy and based on available well data over 
the Quebec Utica and public data from US Utica and Marcellus shale 
plays. The evaluation consisted of the Upper Utica which includes the 
Indian Castle and Dolgeville members as well as the Flat Creek. The Flat
 Creek, the lower most member, was only evaluated to estimate 
undiscovered petroleum initially-in-place ("UPIIP"). No recoverable 
resources were assigned to the Flat Creek given the lack of test data 
showing established technology can support commercial development at 
this time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GLJ Resource 
Assessment is based on the results from several vertical and horizontal 
wells on the Questerre’s acreage that have all encountered pay in the 
Utica. Test data from these wells in conjunction with offset development
 and studies of the analogous US Utica supports the prospective 
commercial development of these resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Significant positive 
factors relevant to the estimate of Questerre’s resources include the 
importation of all natural gas consumed in Quebec creating demand for 
local production, premium realized pricing due to the transportation 
costs associated with importing natural gas for consumption, production 
test data from Questerre’s existing wells and the development of the 
analogous Utica shale in the United States. Significant negative factors
 include the limited number of wells on Questerre’s acreage, lack of a 
developed service sector providing uncertainty regarding estimates of 
capital and operating costs, developing hydrocarbon regulations and 
environmental legislation and the requirement to obtain social 
acceptability for oil and gas operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Questerre believes 
it will have sufficient financial capability to fund its share of costs 
associated with the development program in the GLJ Resource Assessment, 
it may not have access to the necessary capital when required. 
Conducting the development program is also dependent on the 
participation by Questerre’s joint venture partners. There is no 
guarantee that they will elect to participate in the program to the 
extent required. Questerre retains the right to conduct activities 
without the operators’ participation on an independent operations basis 
whereby it can fund 100% of the capital costs for certain well 
operations and facilities in return for net revenue equal to 400% of its
 capital investment before the operators can elect to either remain in a
 penalty position or hold a working interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The TPIIP was determined 
probabilistically on a permit basis with estimates of 45 to 145 Bcf per 
square mile for the Upper Utica. This compares favorably to analogous US
 shale plays with estimates of the Utica in Ohio at between 35 to 85 Bcf
 per square mile and 25 to 150 Bcf per square mile for the Marcellus 
shale in Pennsylvania. Of the TPIIP estimated over Questerre’s acreage, 
only land within a 3 mile radius of a successfully tested well was 
quantified as discovered gas-in-place. Based on this qualification only 
16% of the total mapped TPIIP in the Upper Utica was considered 
discovered Contingent Resource.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Upper Utica was 
considered undiscovered for approximately 84% of the total mapped TPIIP.
 Recovery factors of 18%, 26% and 37% were applied to the low, best and 
high estimates resource cases respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Summary information 
regarding contingent resources and net present value of future net 
revenues from contingent resources are set forth below and are derived, 
in each case, from the GLJ Resource Assessment. All contingent resources
 evaluated in the GLJ Resource Assessment were deemed economic at the 
effective date of December 31, 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questerre’s average 
working interest in its gross best estimate Contingent Resources is 
25.9%. In addition to Questerre’s working interest, the Company also 
holds a royalty interest in the acreage and associated resources. As a 
result, in some cases Questerre’s net volumes (after royalties) exceed 
its working interest volumes. For clarity, included in the following 
tables are Questerre’s volume before royalties, gross working interest 
volumes and net volumes after royalties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A range of contingent 
resources estimates (low, best and high) were prepared by GLJ. See notes
 5 to 7 of the tables below for a description of low estimate, best 
estimate and high estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GLJ Resources 
Assessment estimated gross risked contingent resources with a project 
maturity subclass of development on hold of 18.6 million boe (low 
estimate) to 50.0 million boe (high estimate), with a best estimate of 
30.4 million boe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GLJ Resources 
Assessment estimated gross risked contingent resources with a project 
maturity subclass of development unclarified of 8.9 million boe (low 
estimate) to 23.8 million boe (high estimate), with a best estimate of 
14.6 million boe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estimate of risked net
 present value of future net revenue of contingent resources is 
preliminary in nature and is provided to assist the reader in reaching 
an opinion on the merit and likelihood of the Company proceeding with 
the required investment. It includes contingent resources that are 
considered too uncertain with respect to the chance of development to be
 classified as reserves. There is uncertainty that the risked net 
present value of future net revenue will be realized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent resources can 
be sub-classified based on their project maturity sub-class which help 
identify a project’s change of commerciality. The project maturity 
subclasses for contingent resources are “development pending”, 
“development on hold”, “development unclarified” or “development not 
viable”, all as defined in the COGE Handbook. “Development pending” is 
when resolution of the final conditions for development is being 
actively pursued (high chance of development). “Development on hold” is 
when there is a reasonable chance of development, but there are major 
non-technical contingencies to be resolved that are usually beyond the 
control of the operator. “Development unclarified” is when the 
evaluation is incomplete and there is ongoing activity to resolve any 
risks or uncertainties. “Development not viable” is when no further data
 acquisition or evaluation is currently planned and hence there is a low
 chance of development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those areas classified as
 development on hold are primarily contingent on the passage of 
applicable hydrocarbon and environmental legislation and regulations as 
well as local acceptability. Remaining areas classified as development 
unclarified have additional contingency or risk associated with securing
 <b>social license</b> to operate and are thereby a lower priority for 
development. Additional contingencies include firm development plans, 
detailed cost estimates and corporate approvals and sanctioning. There 
is no certainty that any portion of the Contingent Resources will be 
economic to develop. Though pilot horizontal development plans have been
 proposed, the project evaluation scenario for the Contingent Resources 
is not sufficiently defined to make an investment decision to proceed to
 development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources are 
evaluated based on the same fiscal conditions used in the assessment of 
reserves, and as such, are forecasted to be economic. Contingent 
Resource values are estimated on the basis of established technology, 
namely multistage hydraulic fracturing recovery technologies that are 
widely used in the development of shale gas plays including in the 
Montney in Canada and the Utica formation in Ohio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chance of 
commerciality for Contingent Resources is equal to the product of the 
chance of discovery and the chance of development. “Chance of discovery”
 is the estimated probability that exploration activities will confirm 
the existence of a significant accumulation of potentially recoverable 
petroleum. “Chance of development” is the estimated probability that, 
once discovered, a known accumulation will be commercially developed. 
Based on contingencies related to the passage of applicable hydrocarbon 
and environmental legislation, regulations, local acceptability, and 
additional risk associated with securing <b>social license</b> to 
operate, firm development plans, detailed cost estimates and corporate 
approvals GLJ estimated the Chance of Development for the development 
unclarified subclass ranges between 10% and 25% as detailed in the table
 below. By definition the chance of discovery for Contingent Resource is
 100%. The corresponding chance of commerciality for the development 
unclarified subclass is therefore estimated at between 10% and 25% as 
detailed in the table below.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notes:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Contingent resources 
are defined in the COGE Handbook as those quantities of petroleum 
estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from known 
accumulations using established technology or technology under 
development, but which are not currently considered to be commercially 
recoverable due to one or more contingencies. There is no certainty that
 it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the contingent
 resources or that Questerre will produce any portion of the volumes 
currently classified as contingent resources. The estimates of 
contingent resources involve implied assessment, based on certain 
estimates and assumptions, that the resources described exists in the 
quantities predicted or estimated, as at a given date, and that the 
resources can be profitably produced in the future. The risked net 
present value of the future net revenue from the contingent resources 
does not represent the fair market value of the contingent resources. 
Actual contingent resources (and any volumes that may be reclassified as
 reserves) and future production therefrom may be greater than or less 
than the estimates provided herein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* GLJ prepared the 
estimates of contingent resources shown for each property using 
deterministic principles and methods. Probabilistic aggregation of the 
low and high property estimates shown in the table might produce 
different total volumes than the arithmetic sums shown in the table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* "Gross” contingent 
resources are Questerre's working interest (operating or non-operating) 
share before deduction of royalties and without including any royalty 
interests of Questerre. "Net” contingent resources are Questerre's 
working interest (operating or non-operating) share after deduction of 
royalty obligations, plus Questerre's royalty interests in contingent 
resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The risked net present 
value of future net revenue attributable to the contingent resources 
does not represent the fair market value of the contingent resources. 
Estimated abandonment and reclamation costs have been included in the 
evaluation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Low Estimate Contingent
 Resources are considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity 
that will actually be recovered. It is likely that the actual remaining 
quantities recovered will exceed the low estimate. If probabilistic 
methods are used, there should be at least a 90 percent probability 
(P90) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the 
low estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Best Estimate 
Contingent Resources are considered to be the best estimate of the 
quantity that will actually be recovered. It is equally likely that the 
actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the 
best estimate. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at 
least a 50 percent probability (P50) that the quantities actually 
recovered will equal or exceed the best estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* High Estimate 
Contingent Resources are considered to be an optimistic estimate of the 
quantity that will actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual
 remaining quantities recovered will exceed the high estimate. If 
probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 10 percent 
probability (P10) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or 
exceed the high estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Chance of 
Development (CoDev) is the estimated probability that, once discovered, a
 known accumulation will be commercially developed. Five factors have 
been considered in determining the CoDev as follows:CoDev = Ps (Economic
 Factor) × Ps (Technology Factor) × Ps (Development Plan Factor) ×Ps 
(Development Timeframe Factor) × Ps (Other Contingency Factor) wherein 
Ps is the probability of successEconomic Factor – For reserves to be 
assessed, a project must be economic. With respect to contingent 
resources, this factor captures uncertainty in the assessment of 
economic status principally due to uncertainty in cost estimates and 
marketing options. Economic viability uncertainty due to technology is 
more aptly captured with the Technology Factor. The Economic Factor will
 be 1 for reserves and will often be 1 for development pending projects 
and for projects with a development study or pre-development study with a
 robust rate of return. A robust rate of return means that the project 
retains economic status with variation in costs and/or marketing plans 
over the expected range of outcomes for these variables.Technology 
Factor - For reserves to be assessed, a project must utilize established
 technology. With respect to contingent resources, this factor captures 
the uncertainty in the viability of the proposed technology for the 
subject reservoir, namely, the uncertainty associated with technology 
under development. By definition, technology under development is a 
recovery process or process improvement that has been determined to be 
technically viable via field test and is being field tested further to 
determine its economic viability in the subject reservoir. The 
Technology Factor will be 1 for reserves and for established technology.
 For technology under development, this factor will consider different 
risks associated with technologies being developed at the scale of the 
well versus the scale of a project and technologies which are being 
modified or extended for the subject reservoir versus new emerging 
technologies which have not previously been applied in any commercial 
application. The risk assessment will also consider the quality and 
sufficiency of the test data available, the ability to reliably scale 
such data and the ability to extrapolate results in time.Development 
Plan Factor – For reserves to be assessed, a project must have a 
detailed development plan. With respect to contingent resources, this 
factor captures the uncertainty in the project evaluation scenario. The 
Development Plan Factor will be 1 for reserves and high, approaching 1, 
for development pending projects. This factor will consider development 
plan detail variations including the degree of delineation, reservoir 
specific development and operating strategy detail (technology decision,
 well layouts (spacing and pad locations), completion strategy, start-up
 strategy, water source and disposal, other infrastructure, facility 
design, marketing plans etc) and the quality of the cost estimates as 
provided by the developer.Development Timeframe Factor – In the case of 
major projects, for reserves to be assessed, first major capital 
spending must be initiated within 5 years of the effective date. The 
Development Timeframe Factor will be 1 for reserves and will often be 1 
for development pending projects provided the project is planned 
on-stream based on the same criteria used in the assessment of reserves.
 With respect to contingent resources, the factor will approach 1 for 
projects planned on-stream with a timeframe slightly longer than the 
limiting reserves criteria.Other Contingency Factor – For reserves to be
 assessed, all contingencies must be eliminated. With respect to 
contingent resources, this factor captures major contingencies, usually 
beyond the control of the operator, other than those captured by 
economic status, technology status, project evaluation scenario status 
and the development timeframe. The Other Contingency Factor will be 1 
for reserves and for development pending projects and less than 1 for on
 hold. Provided all contingencies have been identified and their 
resolution is reasonably certain, this factor would also be 1 for 
development unclarified projects.These factors may be inter-related 
(dependent) and care has been taken to ensure that risks are 
appropriately accounted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Contingent resources 
for the Lowlands have been estimated based the results from several 
vertical and horizontal wells on the Company’s acreage that have all 
encountered pay in the Utica. Test data from these wells in conjunction 
with offset development and studies of analogous US Utica supports the 
prospective commercial development on these resources. The estimated 
unrisked cost to bring these contingent resources on commercial 
production is $809.28 million and the expected timeline is between 2 and
 11 years. The specific contingencies for these resources are the 
passage of applicable hydrocarbon and environmental legislation,

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Summary information 
regarding prospective resources and net present value of future net 
revenues from prospective resources are set forth below and are derived,
 in each case, from the GLJ Resources Assessment. The GLJ Resources 
Assessment was prepared in accordance with COGE Handbook and NI-51-101 
by GLJ, an independent qualified reserve evaluator. All prospective 
resources evaluated in the GLJ Resources Assessment were deemed economic
 at the effective date of December 31, 2017. Prospective resources are 
in addition to reserves estimated in the GLJ Report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Upper Utica was 
considered undiscovered for approximately 84% of the total mapped TPIIP.
 Recovery factors of 19%, 27% and 40% were applied to the low, best and 
high estimates resource cases respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A range of prospective 
resources estimates (low, best and high) were prepared by GLJ. See notes
 6 to 8 of the tables below for a description of low estimate, best 
estimate and high estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GLJ Resources 
Assessment estimated gross risked prospective resources of 87 million 
boe (low estimate) to 238 million boe (high estimate), with a best 
estimate of 143 million boe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chance of 
commerciality for Prospective Resources is equal to the product of the 
chance of discovery and the chance of development. “Chance of discovery”
 is the estimated probability that exploration activities will confirm 
the existence of a significant accumulation of potentially recoverable 
petroleum. “Chance of development” is the estimated probability that, 
once discovered, a known accumulation will be commercially developed. 
Based on contingencies related to the passage of applicable hydrocarbon 
and environmental legislation, regulations, local acceptability, and 
additional risk associated with securing <b>social license</b> to 
operate, firm development plans, detailed cost estimates and corporate 
approvals GLJ estimated the Chance of Development at 19 percent. 
Proximity to extensional and compressional-related fault systems 
presents risk of structuring resulting in leak off and reduced pressures
 in some prospective regions, additionally, lack of delineation data 
provides reservoir risk associated with uncertainty regarding reservoir 
quality and rock mechanics amicable to hydraulic fracturing. Therefore, 
GLJ has estimated the Chance of Discovery at 81 percent. The 
corresponding chance of commerciality is 15 percent. This also takes 
into account Questerre’s working interest and operatorship of its assets
 as Questerre is subject to the priorities of working interest partners 
for such assets. Production and development forecasts were not completed
 by GLJ as part of the prospective resources evaluation.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notes:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Prospective resources 
are defined in the COGE Handbook as those quantities of petroleum 
estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from 
unknown accumulations by application of future development projects. 
Prospective resources have both an associated chance of discovery 
(CoDis) and a chance of development (CoDev). There is no certainty that 
any portion of the prospective resources will be discovered. If 
discovered, there is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to
 produce any portion of the prospective resources or that Questerre will
 produce any portion of the volumes currently classified as prospective 
resources. The estimates of prospective resources involve implied 
assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the 
resources described exists in the quantities predicted or estimated, as 
at a given date, and that the resources can be profitably produced in 
the future. The risked net present value of the future net revenue from 
the prospective resources does not represent the fair market value of 
the prospective resources. Actual prospective resources (and any volumes
 that may be reclassified as reserves) and future production therefrom 
may be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* GLJ prepared the 
estimates of prospective resources shown for each property using 
deterministic principles and methods. Probabilistic aggregation of the 
low and high property estimates shown in the table might produce 
different total volumes than the arithmetic sums shown in the table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The forecast price and 
cost assumptions utilized in the year-end 2017 reserves report were also
 utilized by GLJ in preparing the GLJ Resource Assessmen</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* "Gross” prospective 
resources are Questerre’s working interest (operating or non-operating) 
share before deduction of royalties and without including any royalty 
interests of the Company. "Net” prospective resources are Questerre’s 
working interest (operating or non-operating) share after deduction of 
royalty obligations, plus Questerre’s royalty interests in prospective 
resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The risked net present 
value of future net revenue attributable to the prospective resources 
does not represent the fair market value of the prospective resources. 
Estimated abandonment and reclamation costs have been included in the 
evaluation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Low Estimate 
Prospective Resources is considered to be a conservative estimate of the
 quantity that will actually be recovered. It is likely that the actual 
net remaining quantities recovered will exceed the low estimate of 87 
million boe. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least
 a 90 percent probability (P90) that the quantities actually recovered 
will equal or exceed the low estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Best Estimate 
Prospective Resources is considered to be the best estimate of the 
quantity that will actually be recovered. It is equally likely that the 
actual net remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than 
the best estimate of 143 million. If probabilistic methods are used, 
there should be at least a 50 percent probability (P50) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the best estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The High Estimate 
Prospective Resources is considered to be an optimistic estimate of the 
quantity that will actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual
 net remaining quantities recovered will exceed the high estimate of 238
 million boe. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at 
least a 10 percent probability (P10) that the quantities actually 
recovered will equal or exceed the high estimate.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All evaluations and 
reviews of future net revenue are stated prior to any provision for 
interest costs or general and administrative costs and after the 
deduction of estimated future capital expenditures for wells to which 
reserves have been assigned. The estimated future net revenue from the 
production of disclosed oil and gas reserves does not represent the fair
 market value of the Company’s reserves. There is no assurance that such
 price and cost assumptions will be attained and variances could be 
material. The recovery and reserve estimates of crude oil, NGLs and 
natural gas reserves provided herein are estimates only and there is no 
guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered. Actual light 
and medium crude oil, shale gas and natural gas liquids reserves may be 
greater than or less than the estimates provided herein. All of the 
Company’s light and medium crude oil, shale gas and natural gas liquids 
reserves are located in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barrel of oil equivalent 
(“boe”) amounts may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A 
boe conversion ratio has been calculated using a conversion rate of six 
thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil and the 
conversion ratio of one barrel to six thousand cubic feet is based on an
 <b>energy</b> equivalent conversion method application at the burner 
tip and does not necessarily represent an economic value equivalent at 
the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of 
crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the
 <b>energy</b> equivalent of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estimates of reserves
 and future net revenue for individual properties may not reflect the 
same confidence level as estimates of reserves and future net revenue 
for all properties, due to the effects of aggregation.</p>

 ("Tahoe" or the "Company") (TSX: THO, NYSE: TAHO) has been informed 
that the Constitutional Court of Guatemala requested additional 
information in the legal case regarding Minera San Rafael's Escobal 
mining license. The Company has not yet received the formal resolution 
from the Court but understands the request requires certain information 
be provided to the Court within 15 business days from the date of the 
formal resolution.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
 In addition to asking for original copies of documents submitted last 
July, some of the information requested by the Court includes: an 
anthropological study of the surrounding communities to establish the 
current populations of indigenous people in San Rafael las Flores and 
several surrounding communities, a third-party review of the Escobal 
Environmental Impact Study and the mitigation measures required by the 
study, and a third-party review of the Ministry of <b>Energy</b> and 
Mines' consultation process that led to the initial mining license being
 granted in 2013. Some of the information requested appears to examine 
areas that were not appealed by any of the parties in the case.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ron Clayton, Tahoe Resources President and CEO: "We are certainly 
disappointed with the continued delay in the case and the amount of time
 it has taken the Constitutional Court to request this information, but 
we are hopeful this means the Court is undertaking a serious review of 
the issues in this case, including a review of indigenous populations by
 the Ministry of Culture and compliance with International Labor 
Organization Convention 169. In the long term, ensuring that the 
Constitutional Court is fully informed about these critical issues will 
enhance the credibility of its final decision and, in turn, strengthen 
the Company's community relationships and <b>social license</b> to 
operate.&nbsp;Given that much of the information requested was provided 
as part of the initial Court filings in July 2017, we urge the 
ministries, agencies, and third parties to comply with the Court's 
15-day deadline and the Court to provide its final ruling quickly 
thereafter. We strongly believe that the Court has all the information 
legally necessary to resolve this case today and therefore following 
receipt of this information, the Court should be prepared to follow 
legal precedent by upholding the lower court's ruling to reinstate our 
license."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company regrets that 
the termination of additional Minera San Rafael employees is now 
inevitable due to the continued delay in the legal proceedings. In 
total, approximately half of the employees will have had their contracts
 terminated as a result. Prior to the license suspension, Minera San 
Rafael employed 1,030 people, 97% of whom are Guatemalan and 50% of whom
 are from the Santa Rosa region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tahoe is eager to resume 
operations at Escobal in order to return benefit to employees, 
communities, and the region. Upon receipt of a favorable resolution from
 the Court, Tahoe will seek to restore its workforce. For every month of
 delay in operations at Escobal, approximately $4 million in taxes and 
royalties are not being paid to the Government of Guatemala and the 
local communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ON FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This news release 
contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A 
of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of 
the United States Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the United States 
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, or in releases made by
 the <span class="companylink">United States Securities and Exchange Commission</span>,
 all as may be amended from time to time, and "forward-looking 
information" under the provisions of applicable Canadian securities 
legislation, concerning the business, operations and financial 
performance and condition of the Company. Forward-looking statements 
include, but are not limited to, timing and possible outcome of pending 
litigation, including any review or appeal of the definitive decision 
from the Supreme Court of Guatemala which reinstated the Company's 
mining license in respect of the Escobal mine; the timing and results of
 the petition or any appeal for the annual renewal of Escobal's export 
credential; the time and likelihood for responses of the Constitutional 
Court's demands for additional information and studies and the time, 
likelihood and possible outcome of a decision to be issued by the 
Constitutional Court on appeal; the timing, scope, results and 
implications to the Company of court-ordered consultation processes; the
 timing and amount of foregone taxes and royalties; the timing and 
likelihood of further workforce reductions; the timing and likelihood of
 the road blockage being peacefully cleared and resolved; the timing and
 amount of estimated future production, costs of production, capital 
expenditures, exploration expenses, free cash flow, currency exchange 
rate fluctuations, requirements for additional capital; the future price
 of silver, gold, lead and zinc; government regulation of mining 
operations title disputes or claims; and limitations on insurance 
coverage. Generally, these forward-looking statements can be identified 
by the use of forward-looking terminology such as "plans", "expects", 
"is expected", "budget", "scheduled", "estimates", "forecasts", 
"intends", "anticipates", "believes", or variations or comparable 
language of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, 
events or results "may", "could", "would", "should", "might" or "will be
 taken", "occur" or "be achieved" or the negative connotation thereof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forward-looking 
statements are necessarily based upon a number of factors and 
assumptions that, if untrue, could cause the actual results, 
performances or achievements of the Company to be materially different 
from future results, performances or achievements expressed or implied 
by such statements. Such statements and information are based on 
numerous assumptions regarding present and future business strategies 
and the environment in which Tahoe will operate in the future, including
 the price of silver, gold, lead and zinc, anticipated costs, 
sufficiency of capital resources and the possibility of considering 
alternative financing arrangements to meet strategic needs, and ability 
to achieve goals.&nbsp; Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list is
 not exhaustive.&nbsp; Tahoe's actual results, programs and financial 
position could differ materially from those anticipated in such 
forward-looking statements as a result of numerous factors, risks and 
uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's control.&nbsp; 
These include, but are not necessarily limited to workings of the 
Guatemalan legal system, social unrest and political or economic 
instability in Guatemala and the Company's ability to efficiently resume
 operations once the suspension of the mining license is lifted and 
roadblock is cleared, re-issuance of licenses, permits and credentials 
affecting the operation of the Company's mines, and relationships with 
our partners, including employees, vendors and community populations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certain important factors
 that could cause actual results, performances or achievements to differ
 materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, among 
others, silver, gold, lead and zinc price volatility, discrepancies 
between actual and estimated production, mineral reserves and mineral 
resources and metallurgical recoveries, mining operational and 
development risks, litigation risks, regulatory restrictions (including 
environmental regulatory restrictions and liability), changes in 
national and local government legislation, taxation, controls or 
regulations and/or change in the administration of laws, policies and 
practices, expropriation or nationalization of property and political or
 economic developments in Guatemala, Peru, and Canada, and other 
jurisdictions in which the Company does or may carry on business in the 
future, delays, suspension and technical challenges associated with 
capital projects, higher prices for fuel, steel, power, labor and other 
consumables, currency fluctuations, the speculative nature of gold 
exploration, the global economic climate, dilution, share price 
volatility, competition, loss of key employees, additional funding 
requirements and defective title to mineral claims or property.&nbsp; 
Although Tahoe believes its expectations are based upon reasonable 
assumptions and has attempted to identify important factors that could 
cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those 
described in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that
 cause actions, events or results not to be as anticipated, estimated or
 intended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forward-looking 
statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and 
other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different 
from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such
 risks, uncertainties and other factors include but are not limited to; 
the fluctuation of the price of silver and gold; opposition to 
development and mining operations by one or more groups of indigenous 
people; actions that impede or prevent the operations of the Company's 
mines; the inability to develop and operate the Company's mines or 
projects; social unrest and political or economic instability and 
uncertainties in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates; the 
timing and ability to maintain and, where necessary, obtain and renew 
necessary permits and licenses; changes in national and local government
 legislation, taxation and controls or regulations; environmental and 
other governmental regulation compliance; the uncertainty in the 
estimation of mineral resources and mineral reserves; fluctuations in 
currency exchange rates; infrastructure risks, including access to 
roads, water and power and the timing and possible outcome of pending or
 threatened litigation and the risk of unexpected litigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a more detailed 
discussion of these and other risks relevant to the Company, see the 
Company's Management's Discussion and Analysis for the fourth quarter of
 2017 filed on SEDAR and with the <span class="companylink">SEC</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Tahoe has 
attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results 
to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements,
 there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated,
 estimated or intended.&nbsp; There can be no assurance that such 
statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future 
events could differ materially from those anticipated in such 
statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on 
forward-looking statements.&nbsp; Forward-looking statements are made as
 of the date hereof and, accordingly, are subject to change after such 
date.&nbsp; Except as otherwise indicated by Tahoe, these statements do 
not reflect the potential impact of any non-recurring or other special 
items or of any disposition, monetization, merger, acquisition, other 
business combination or other transaction that may be announced or that 
may occur after the date hereof.&nbsp; Forward-looking statements are

current expectations and plans and allowing investors and others to get a
 better understanding of Tahoe's operating environment.&nbsp; Tahoe does

 (“Questerre” or the “Company”) (TSX:QEC) (OSE:QEC) announced today that
 it has entered into an agreement with an experienced operator to 
develop its 100% acreage in the Kakwa area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, President and Chief Executive Officer of Questerre, 
commented, “The first well at Kakwa North should spud next quarter, 
subject to rig availability. Given the strong condensate production and 
low sour content from nearby wells on our joint venture acreage we are 
looking forward to the results.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He further added, “With 
this joint venture we are developing our operated acreage and preserving
 capital primarily for Quebec. We are working on our Quebec Clean Gas 
pilot as we wait for the release of the final regulations later this 
spring.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The farm-in partner is an
 exploration and production company with extensive operating experience 
with the Montney Formation in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subject to the terms of 
the agreement, the farm-in partner has the right to drill, complete, 
equip and tie-in two horizontal wells targeting the Montney Formation to
 earn a 50% interest in certain acreage held by Questerre at Kakwa 
North. The partner has the option to drill, complete, equip and tie-in 
additional wells to earn a similar interest in other acreage held by 
Questerre at Kakwa North and Kakwa South. Questerre will hold a royalty 
interest in these initial wells and certain subsequent wells subject to 
standard payout provisions. Questerre currently holds a 100% interest in
 4,480 acres at Kakwa North along with 3,840 acres at Kakwa South and a 
25% interest in 10,240 acres on its joint venture block.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questerre also reported 
on plans for additional activity targeting its shallow mineral rights, 
above and excluding Montney rights, at Kakwa North. The Company was 
recently advised by the operator that it plans to drill up to six 
horizontal wells on this acreage in 2018. Questerre holds an overriding 
royalty interest in 4160 acres of shallow rights at Kakwa North.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questerre <b>Energy</b> Corporation</span> is 
leveraging its expertise gained through early exposure to shale and 
other non-conventional reservoirs. The Company has base production and 
reserves in the tight oil Bakken/Torquay of southeast Saskatchewan. It 
is bringing on production from its lands in the heart of the 
high-liquids Montney shale fairway. It is a leader on <b>social license</b>
 to operate issues for its Utica shale gas discovery in the St. Lawrence
 Lowlands, Quebec. It is pursuing oil shale projects with the aim of

hydrocarbon bearing formations on its lands; that drilling operations on
 its lands will be successful such that further development activities 
in these areas are warranted; that Questerre will continue to conduct 
its operations in a manner consistent with past operations; results from
 drilling and development activities will be consistent with past 
operations; the general stability of the economic and political

facility construction and expansion and the ability of Questerre to 
secure adequate product transportation; future commodity prices; 
currency, exchange and interest rates; regulatory framework regarding

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OK,
 so let me see if I've got this right: After three years of raising 
taxes on oil companies and everyone who works in the patch (plus just 
about everyone else in Alberta), after the carbon tax, a 50% increase in
 the tax on large industrial emitters, the coal shutdown, the hard cap 
on oilsands emissions and a pile of other red tape and regulations on 
the oil industry, the Notley government announces $1 billion in grants 
and loans guarantees for bitumen upgraders and we're all supposed to be 
blown away by their commitment to Alberta's <b>energy</b> industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By modest estimates, 
Alberta has lost between $30 billion to $35 billion in oil and gas 
investment since the NDP nightmare began in May 2015, and now the Notley
 government wants Albertans to be grateful that it is putting $1 billion
 back into the industry over eight years.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without
 doubt, much of the lost investment was due to the downturn in world oil
 prices and to the fact that we cannot get pipelines built that will 
take our oil to international markets - neither of which is the fault of
 the NDP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's not as if we are losing out to developing countries in the investment race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We certainly are losing out to places such Egypt and Kazakhstan and Tanzania.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But mostly we are losing 
out to jurisdictions that are the most like Alberta: Texas, Oklahoma, 
North Dakota. We are losing out to places where the geology and the 
financial landscapes are similar to Alberta. Often in the past, when 
they've boomed we've boomed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we are being passed 
by now, while they surge ahead, in large part because our New Democrats 
have been operating under the ridiculous belief that if we could just 
beggar ourselves with environmental regulations and taxes, we could buy "<b>social license</b>" that would cause "green" politicians and environmentalists to grant us permits to build pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And after that strategy 
has turned out to be such a spectacular failure, the NDP think Albertans
 can be bought off with an investment of $125 million a year for eight 
years to "diversify" our oil and gas sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industrial goal of 
the Notley government's diversification strategy, released Monday is 
sound. Indeed, it's clever and practical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Get a few upgraders built
 that don't fully refine oilsands bitumen, but rather upgrade it part 
way. That reduces the need to add diluent to the bitumen, which means 
more bitumen can fit down a pipeline and there is no need to remove 
diluent at the other end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP also want to see 
more liquification of natural gas done in Alberta so our methane and 
other gases can be shipped more easily to west coast terminals. That's 
all very sensible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the NDP hadn't 
sucked (taxed) so much money out of the patch already (not to mention 
discouraging so much investment and destroying so many jobs), maybe they
 wouldn't have to put back a billion dollars they don't have, just to 
try to stimulate some "diversification."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We should do some 
valueadded processing of our natural resources here, rather than always 
shipping our raw resources down a pipeline to be refined and turned into
 usable products somewhere else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was always 
shortsighted of former Tory governments not to get more refineries and 
upgraders built when the price of oil was high and environmental 
opposition was low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Give the NDP credit for 
taking a step in that direction. But maybe they won't have to spend tax 
dollars trying to force upgraders into existence if they hadn't 
undermined the <b>energy</b> sector so thoroughly in the first place.</p>

died on the vine. Instead, we've seen how the rest of Canada will 
merrily take our teeth and come back for the gaping gums when it comes 
to the <b>energy</b> industry headquartered in our province.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It
 wasn't supposed to be this way. Not when our premier introduced her 
much-vaunted carbon tax - not in an election campaign, mind you, but 
after the NDP was somewhat unexpectedly ensconced in power. Back then, 
Rachel Notley waxed lyrical about the benefits of imposing this "levy" 
on us rubes while shutting down our nasty coal industry, capping 
emissions from the oilsands and sending out environmental missionaries 
bearing gifts of free light bulbs and the wherewithal to screw them into
 our sockets. Ouch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It began well enough - 
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was giggly and gung-ho at telling the 
world "Canada is back" and pulling its weight in the fight to slow 
global warming. Heck, at one point, early on in this dreary debacle, 
Alberta and Notley even got a shout out from Barack Obama himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, that was after
 he'd repeatedly stuck a presidential fork into the Keystone XL pipeline
 project aimed at boosting the amount of our oil traveling through his 
country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, those were the days. 
Yet, like a prairie summer, they didn't last. Soon, Notley got a 
reminder winter was a-coming, and not because she was watching Game of 
Thrones on <span class="companylink">Netflix</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First to put the boot into this brave new world of <b>social license</b>, where we'd scratch the environmental inch and in turn have our tummies tickled in getting oil to tidewater, was Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">La belle province placed so many obstacles into the path of the <b>Energy</b> East pipeline project aimed at taking crude to the Atlantic coast that <span class="companylink">TransCanada Corp</span>. eventually called it quits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now it's British 
Columbia's turn, using the same endless delays to thwart the Trans 
Mountain extension project, despite construction being given a federal 
nod.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's left Trudeau 
twisting in the wind, so no wonder he's merrily messing about in India, 
even if no one there is that keen to greet him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, we've got the 
now-notorious wine ban. Glory be - whatever next? Maybe a B.C. salmon 
boycott? There are so many billions of dollars at stake for the province
 and country that such weak symbolism is akin to taking a penknife to a 
gunfight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nope, if we want to see action, it's time to kick into gear the anti-<b>social license</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It goes like this. First,
 we're ditching the carbon tax. Next, we're reversing the mothballing of
 our coal industry that threatened the existence of so many Alberta 
towns and, finally, that cap on emissions - well, poof, it's gone. David
 Copperfield, eat your heart out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, but that's 
irresponsible. We'll be contributing to global warming and the seas will
 rise and threaten coastal areas everywhere. Oh, really? Darn it, but 
isn't Alberta well above 2,000 feet above sea level, even in the shallow
 bits? It'll be a while before we get our feet wet. Victoria and 
Vancouver, you say? Oh well, we'll have a whip round and send them some 
green-coloured sandbags.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then we'll make direct 
overtures to the U.S. administration about pumping more oil south - it 
isn't moving in any other direction. So what if that messes up delicate <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>
 renegotiations. The Americans still need our oil - maybe more than they
 need those cars made in Ontario or those jets from Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagine Trudeau's face: "What's Alberta doing? Get me Notley, right now. I can't have the Aga Khan hearing about this."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, she's busy installing a coal-fired furnace. But we're forwarding your call to the B.C premier's office.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our <b>energy</b> sector 
produces some of the most ethical product available in the global

 actions by B.C. NDP Premier John Horgan makes it appear that the social

tax, has no credibility or effective ability to gain market access in 
his jurisdiction. The B.C. premier seems intent on creating further 
delays and obstructions to the Kinder-Morgan Trans Mountain pipeline 
expansion and other critical infrastructure projects that employ tens of
 thousands of Albertans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta is facing what 
can only be described as unnecessary economic hardship that has been 
orchestrated by our own government's creation of a job-killing carbon 
tax that has yet to produce any net positive results. The carbon tax was
 marched out as the key to Alberta's economic future by opening doors to
 markets that were otherwise inaccessible. Those doors will remain 
closed until pipelines are built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The approval of pipelines
 is not something that should ever become a rubber-stamp process; but it
 also cannot become an endless mountain of regulatory burden and 
unnecessary delays. The health of Alberta and Canada's economy is 
reliant on the health of our industries and their ability to get their 
products to market. The actions, and in some cases the inactions of 
varying levels of government, have not been in the best interest of 
anyone in Alberta and Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ease with which 
regulatory approval and construction delays can be achieved has become a
 politicized quagmire created by special interest groups and their 
political facilitators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier Horgan is 
justifying this latest delay so that yet another government sponsored 
panel can study the project. Politically motivated delays cost our 
economy billions of dollars across this country each year, which 
ultimately is felt in every industry and consequently every home 
directly and indirectly.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In
 October 2016, Prime Minister Trudeau's announcement that Canadian 
provinces would be required to adopt carbon pricing was met with wide 
political agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both the United States 
and China had recently agreed to the Paris climate accord, and 
provincial governments in Canada's three largest provinces had already 
committed to some form of carbon pricing.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta,
 home of Canada's most abundant oilsands and a traditional bastion of 
conservative support, had broken with decades of Progressive 
Conservative leadership, electing an NDP government that presented 
carbon pricing as a critical part of the oil industry's <b>social license</b>
 to export its products to market. Across the country, Liberal 
provincial governments held power. Conservatives were at a historically 
low ebb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former Prime Minister 
Harper's inability to adequately address climate change had hurt 
perceptions of Canadian resources; a new approach was needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What a difference 16 
months make. Alberta is locked in a battle with its provincial 
counterparts in British Columbia over the Trans Mountain Pipeline. While
 the federal government has expressed support for the project, the 
provincial governments are no longer in the same agreeable position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Albertans, who have long memories of the misguided National <b>Energy</b>
 Program devised by Pierre Elliott Trudeau's government, are 
increasingly conscious of the oilsands' vulnerabilities and are strongly
 resistant to any measures that may diminish its growth. Enter Jason 
Kenney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Breaking from years of 
the Alberta Progressive Conservative Party's efforts to court a bigger 
tent of voters, the former Harper cabinet minister has united the 
province's right-wing forces under a series of unapologetically 
conservative stances, including strident opposition to the carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As this takes place, action and rhetoric from the Trump administration has added pressure to Canadian oil producers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Prime Minister Trudeau and President Barack Obama struck similar tones about building <b>social license</b>
 for oil extraction, Trump has a drastically different vision for 
competitiveness, unlocking millions of jobs by slashing regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suddenly, carbon pricing is facing serious political headwinds as conservatives across Canada spring into action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some Conservatives 
briefly toyed with Michael Chong's plan for a revenue neutral carbon 
tax, Andrew Scheer won the leadership race by promising to scrap carbon 
pricing. He rejects the premise that taxes can fight climate change and 
has ardently emphasized their impact on affordability. The recent 
political climate has only contributed to his resolve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has allies. With Trump's election, the Liberal's newly created Canadian <b>Energy</b>
 Regulator and the harsh impact of the oilsands downturn on our national
 productivity, carbon pricing is beginning to feel like too much too 
soon for many Canadians. And in an era where political conversations are
 increasingly framed around affordability, the added burden of taxes has
 become problematic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This explains the recent 
shift in Ontario politics. Former Progressive Conservative Party of 
Ontario leader Patrick Brown shocked pundits and delegates alike when he
 announced his support for a revenue neutral carbon tax in March 2016. 
Many pundits saw this as a critical point in national discussions around
 carbon pricing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But his swift removal as 
leader has provided a window for anti-carbon pricing advocates to 
rebound in Ontario. While there may have been no appetite for such a 
position in 2016, leadership candidates are now willing to fight against
 carbon taxation in spades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All three leading 
leadership candidates for the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario 
have promised to oppose cap and trade, carbon taxation and any former of
 carbon pricing in no uncertain terms. Call it pandering. Call it 
impractical. But it represents a growing and formidable opposition from 
the most likely candidates to take over as premier of Canada's largest 
province this June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To add to that, 
Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe threatened that Trudeau's government 
would enforce the carbon tax on his province over “[his] dead body.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's clear is that 
after several years of standing down on the issue of the carbon tax, 
conservative parties and politicians are no longer willing to sit idly 
by and allow the Liberals to steer the agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's problematic for 
the federal government is that in many provinces, those same vocal 
opponents look to be set on a path to power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as the political 
tides have turned on this issue before, it seems they have once again — 
at least amongst the conservative base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result? Prime Minister Trudeau has a fight on his hands.</p>

Mr. Chris Bruijnzeels reports</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHAMARAN ANNOUNCES 25% INCREASE IN ATRUSH RESERVES ESTIMATES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Shamaran Petroleum Corp</span>. has increased 
by 25 per cent its estimated proven plus probable (2P) oil reserves for 
the Atrush block as of Dec. 31, 2017, after accounting for Atrush 2017 
production. Reserves and contingent resources estimates were provided by
 <span class="companylink">McDaniel &amp; Associates Consultants Ltd</span>.
 ("McDaniel"), the Company's independent qualified resources evaluator, 
and were prepared in accordance with standards set out in the Canadian 
National Instrument NI 51-101 and Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation 
Handbook (COGEH).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Chris Bruijnzeels, President and CEO of ShaMaran, commented: "These 
year-end reserve estimates demonstrate the world class nature of the 
Atrush field. Total Field Proven plus Probable ("2P") Reserves on a 
property gross basis for Atrush increased from 85.1 MMbbl to 102.7 MMbbl
 which, when 2017 Atrush production of 3.4 MMbbl is included, represents
 an increase of 25 percent. Total Field Unrisked Best Estimate 
Contingent Oil Resources ("2C") on a property gross basis for Atrush 
remained essentially the same at around 296 MMbbl, resulting in an 
overall increase in Atrush best estimate resources of 5%. Our 2018 work 
program aims to move more of the contingent resources into reserves."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McDaniel's estimates 
reflect the encouraging production results from the Atrush field 
following start of production in July 2017, as well as the positive 
drilling results of Chiya Khere-7 well which found the top of the 
reservoir 114 meters higher to prognosis. McDaniel's reserves estimates 
assume that four extra production wells will be drilled to further 
develop the medium gravity oil in the reserves area of the field, 
increasing medium oil recovery. Reserves associated with the heavy oil 
extended well test planned in 2018 for the Chiya Khere-6 well have also 
been included. Reserves which were included in McDaniel's previous 
estimate for heavy oil production from the wells currently producing 
have now been transferred to Contingent Resources because production to 
date has shown no indication of heavy oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(1)This estimate of 
remaining recoverable resources (unrisked) includes contingent resources
 that have not been adjusted for risk based on the chance of 
development. It is not an estimate of Volumes that may be recovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(2)Boe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of 6 Mcf per 1 Bbl is based on an <b>energy</b>
 equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip 
and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company's crude oil 
reserves as of December 31, 2017 and the respective net present values 
of the reserves based on forecast prices and costs were estimated to be

(2)Company gross reserves are based on the Company's 20.1 percent working
   interest share of the property gross reserves. 
(3)Company net reserves are based on Company share of total Cost and Profit
   Revenues. Note, as the government pays income taxes on behalf of the Company
   out of the government's profit oil share, the net reserves were based on the
   effective pre-tax profit revenues by adjusting for the tax rate.

Notes: 
(1)Based on a 20.1 percent Company working interest share of the property gross resources.
(2)There is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the resources.
(3)The Atrush Field contains crude oil of variable density. Fluid type is classified according to
   COGEH: Light/Medium Oil is based on density less than 920 kg/m3 and Heavy Oil is between 920 and
   1000 kg/m3.
(4)These are unrisked contingent resources that do not account for the chance of development which
   is defined as the probability of a project being commercially viable. Quantifying the chance of
   development requires consideration of both economic contingencies and other contingencies, such
   as legal, regulatory, market access, political, <b>social license</b>, internal and external approvals
   and commitment to project finance and development timing. As many of these factors are extremely
   difficult to quantify, the chance of development is uncertain and must be used with caution. The
   chance of development was estimated to be 80 percent for the Crude Oil and 5 percent for the
   Natural Gas.
(5)The contingent resources are sub-classified as "development unclarified" with an "undetermined"
   economic status.

represents an increase of 25 percent. Total Field Unrisked Best Estimate
 Contingent Oil Resources ("2C") on a property gross basis for Atrush 
remained essentially the same at around 296 MMbbl, resulting in an 
overall increase in Atrush best estimate resources of 5%. Our 2018 work 
program aims to move more of the contingent resources into reserves."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McDaniel's estimates 
reflect the encouraging production results from the Atrush field 
following start of production in July 2017, as well as the positive 
drilling results of Chiya Khere-7 well which found the top of the 
reservoir 114 meters higher to prognosis. McDaniel's reserves estimates 
assume that four extra production wells will be drilled to further 
develop the medium gravity oil in the reserves area of the field, 
increasing medium oil recovery. Reserves associated with the heavy oil 
extended well test planned in 2018 for the Chiya Khere-6 well have also 
been included. Reserves which were included in McDaniel's previous 
estimate for heavy oil production from the wells currently producing 
have now been transferred to Contingent Resources because production to 
date has shown no indication of heavy oil.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since boycotts are suddenly fashionable, perhaps now would be an ideal time to suggest we collectively abandon the phrase <b>social license</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when it's become of crucial importance to overcome opposition to Alberta's <b>energy</b> exports and the needed pipeline infrastructure, the phrase <b>social license</b> is confusing, cringe worthy, politically loaded and needlessly distracting. Both sides need to retire it.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this instance, both sides, refers to the current Alberta government and its approach to <b>energy</b> projects and environmental regulations, and the opposition, who have been, and remain, skeptical of the government's approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most everyone agrees that
 the amount of opposition to a proposed pipeline is directly correlated 
to the difficulty in seeing that project through to completion. 
Therefore, it would logically follow that we need to do as much as we 
can to overcome that opposition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One could call that <b>social license</b>, perhaps, but the phrase has already lost most of whatever meaning it had.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concept of <b>social license</b>
 was not invented in Alberta, but it would appear as though the 
government of former premier Alison Redford was the first to use it. A 
June 2012 statement of cabinet and caucus priorities, for example, notes
 the importance of "maintain(ing) the <b>social license</b> to develop resources."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Rachel Notley's government has used it, too, albeit sparingly. The 
premier's preface to the 2016 budget speaks of the need to "strengthen 
Alberta's <b>social license</b>."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Otherwise, though, you'd 
be hard-pressed to find many example of the premier or other members of 
her government using the phrase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To some, the concept 
invokes almost a literal license of sorts - as though Notley is capable 
of establishing such rock solid progressive bona fides that she can wave
 her "<b>social license</b>" around like a sheriff's badge and immediately command the respect of pipeline opponents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Notley can 
certainly be faulted for pandering to environmental groups - and giving 
activists such as Tzeporah Berman positions of power and influence - she
 has never claimed to be capable of vanquishing all opposition to the 
oilsands or pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She deliberately sought 
to try and reassure environmentalists that her government wouldn't 
ignore their concerns, but it's unclear how much she has to show for 
that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hence, the new argument that Notley's <b>social license</b>
 has clearly failed. This is evidenced, it's argued, by the fact that 
opponents of the Trans Mountain pipeline have not backed down and now 
B.C. Premier John Horgan is angling to make trouble for the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What exactly has failed, 
though? Notley's government sold their climate leadership plan (i.e., 
their carbon tax) on the notion that it would make it easier for Prime 
Minister Justin Trudeau to approve pipeline projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that Trudeau did 
indeed say yes to Trans Mountain - and even credited Notley's approach -
 it's hard to argue that approach has failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may yet. Notley is 
going to have to sell the carbon tax in the next election, and if she 
doesn't have an answer to the question, "what do we have to show for 
it?," then she could be in big trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the premier has 
explicitly linked her carbon tax to new pipelines, the demise of Trans 
Mountain would indeed be a failure for her. We'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's also the argument that <b>social license</b>
 is a myth, which of course, depends on how you define it in the first 
place. That it quickly becomes impossible to confirm or discredit such a
 vague assertion is yet another reason to retire the phrase altogether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not a myth to assert that Alberta needs to make the case for its <b>energy</b>
 industry and the needed capacity to get our product to market. It is 
not a myth to argue that we need to win over as many allies to our cause
 as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People can disagree on 
how best to accomplish that or how to define success. Either way, we'll 
be better off if we never hear the phrase <b>social license</b> ever again.</p>

("Sherritt" or the "Corporation") (TSX: S), a world leader in the mining
 and hydrometallurgical refining of nickel and cobalt from lateritic 
ores, today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and 
year ended December 31, 2017. All amounts are in Canadian currency 
unless noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CEO COMMENTARY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sherritt ended 2017 with
 a significantly strengthened balance sheet and a much improved outlook 
as a result of a number of key developments over the past year," said 
David Pathe, President and CEO of Sherritt International. "Most notably,
 we completed the restructuring of the Ambatovy Joint Venture, achieved 
our nickel and cobalt production as well as our unit cost targets at the
 Moa Joint Venture, and benefitted from higher realized prices for each 
of the primary commodities that we produce."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pathe added, "We have
 sustained this momentum since the start of 2018 with our first equity 
financing in more than a decade, and are currently conducting a modified
 Dutch auction tender process to reduce our debt even further. With the 
strong outlook for Class 1 nickel and cobalt given electric vehicle 
market trends and the maturities on our outstanding debentures not due 
until the fourth quarter of 2021, we are particularly encouraged by our 
prospects in 2018 and beyond."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q4 HIGHLIGHTS </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">   -- Sherritt and its partners successfully completed the restructuring of the 
      Ambatovy Joint Venture. Following the restructuring, Sherritt eliminated 
      $1.4 billion in debt from its balance sheet, retained a 12% ownership 
      interest in Ambatovy and continues to serve as operator. 
 
   -- Net direct cash cost (NDCC)(1) at the Moa Joint Venture ("Moa JV") was 
      US$1.80 per pound of finished nickel sold, the lowest total since the 
      third quarter of 2004. The decline was primarily driven by higher cobalt 
      prices and the US$0.50 per pound cost savings achieved with the 
      commissioning of the third acid plant at Moa in the fourth quarter of 
      2016. 
 
   -- Sherritt's share of finished nickel production at the Moa JV was 4,134 
      tonnes, up 9% from Q4 2016, while its share of finished cobalt was 465 
      tonnes, up 22% from Q4 2016. Production increased on a year-over-year 
      basis despite the negative impact heavy rains had on lowering mixed 
      sulphide production in November and December 2017. 
 
   -- Received $19.9 million from the Moa JV as repayment on its working 
      capital facility and US$7.5 million in Cuban <b>energy</b> payments. 
 
   -- Adjusted EBITDA was $49.6 million, up 33% from Q4 2016. 
 
   -- Including a gain of $629.0 million related to the Ambatovy restructuring, 
      earnings were $537.8 million, or $1.80 per share outstanding, up from a 
      net loss of $106.7 million, or $0.36 per share outstanding, in Q4 2016. </pre>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2017 HIGHLIGHTS </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">   -- Sherritt ended the year with cash, cash equivalents and short-term 
      investments of $203.0 million after reflecting payments related to the 
      Ambatovy JV restructuring, interest payments related to outstanding 
      debentures and the $35.0 million repayment of a syndicated revolving-term 
      loan. 
 
   -- Sherritt's share of finished nickel and finished cobalt production at the 
      Moa JV were 15,762 tonnes and 1,801 tonnes, respectively. The production 
      totals were in line with guidance for the year. 
 
   -- NDCC at the Moa Joint Venture was US$2.35 per pound of finished nickel, 
      below the US$2.80 - $3.30 per pound guidance that the Company provided 
      for the year. 
 
   -- Adjusted EBITDA was $149.8 million, up from $40.0 million in 2016. 
 
   -- Including the gain related to the Ambatovy JV restructuring, net earnings 
      were $293.8 million, or $0.99 per share outstanding, up from a net loss 
      of $378.9 million, or $1.29 per share outstanding, in 2016. 
 
   -- Sherritt's efforts to strengthen its balance sheet were reflected in a 
      number of improved financial ratios at year end. Net debt to Adjusted 
      EBITDA reduced from 48.9 at the end 2016 to 4.4 at December 31, 2017 
      while total debt to shareholders' equity improved from 2.1 at the end of 
      2016 to 0.8 at December 31, 2017.(2) </pre>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HIGHLIGHTS SUBSEQUENT TO YEAR END </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">   -- Closed a unit offering financing transaction that generated gross 
      proceeds of $132.0 million. Net proceeds will be used to reduce 
      Sherritt's outstanding indebtedness, for general corporate purposes and 
      to fund future growth initiatives. 
 
   -- Launched a modified Dutch Auction tender offer to repurchase up to $75.0 
      million of outstanding unsecured debentures. The tender offering is 
      expected to close on February 16, 2017. 
 
   -- Executed a three-year extension of the Puerto Escondido/Yumuri production 
      sharing contract to 2021. 
 
   -- Although facilities at the Ambatovy Joint Venture in Madagascar were 
      impacted by Tropical Cyclone Ava, a Category 2 hurricane equivalent storm, 
      all personnel were unhurt and safely accounted for. Damage to equipment 
      and the acid production facilities resulted in a temporary halt in 
      production. Repairs have since been completed and partial production has 
      resumed. A ramp up in production is expected through the end of Q2 2018. </pre>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(2) Net debt is defined 
as debt due within one year plus the book value of long-term debt, less 
cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, as shown in 
Sherritt's consolidated statement of financial position. Total debt is 
defined as debt due within one year plus the book value of long-term 
debt plus the non-recourse debt. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Q4 2017, Sherritt 
generated negative cash flow from operations of $33.9 million. The 
consolidated total included $32.5 million in positive cash flow 
contributions from the Moa JV and Fort Site and $5.4 million in positive
 cash flow contributions from the Power division. Total transaction 
costs of $11.3 million related to the restructuring of the Ambatovy JV 
contributed negatively to the consolidated total.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash, cash equivalents 
and short-term investments at year end were $203.0 million, down from 
$290.3 million at September 30, 2017. The decrease was primarily driven 
by payments related to the restructuring of the Ambatovy JV, lower Cuban
 <b>energy</b> payments received and the repayment of $8.0 million in Q4
 on the Company's syndicated revolving-term loan and partly offset by a 
$19.9 million repayment from the Moa JV on its working capital facility 
to Sherritt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During Q4, US$7.5 million of Cuban <b>energy</b>
 payments were received compared to US$32.6 million in the third quarter
 of 2017. Total Cuban overdue receivables were US$132.6 million at 
December 31, 2017 compared to US$100.5 million at September 30, 2017. 
The increase in overdue receivables was attributable to a number of 
factors, including the impact of Hurricane Irma and resulting recovery 
costs on Cuba's economy. Sherritt has experienced variability in its 
Cuban receivables over the years but has not incurred any losses related
 to any Cuban receivables.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">METAL MARKETS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nickel</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nickel prices rallied in 
the second half of 2017 after experiencing considerable volatility in 
the first six months of the year. The average nickel reference price in 
the fourth quarter was US$5.25 per pound, up 7% from US$4.90 for Q4 
2016. The average nickel reference price for the 12-months of 2017 was 
US$4.72 per pound, up 8% from US$4.36 per pound for 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year-over-year price 
improvements were largely driven by the growing understanding of the 
important role that Class 1 nickel will play in the burgeoning electric 
vehicle (EV) market. Class 1 nickel, along with cobalt, are key elements
 needed to manufacture EV batteries. Demand for Class 1 nickel and 
cobalt are expected to grow significantly beginning in 2019 when China 
expects to begin production quotas requiring that 10% of all vehicles 
manufactured be electric.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During Q4, the nickel 
price was supported by news that nickel pig iron (NPI) producers in 
China were asked to reduce production to alleviate pollution with 
China's largest NPI-only producer ordered to halve production from 
November 2017 to March 2018. Actual and anticipated reductions from 
existing nickel producers also continued to help underpin the nickel 
price, with nickel supply expected to be in a deficit for 2018 and 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nickel reference price improvements in the second half were also driven by the decline in inventories. Combined <span class="companylink">LME</span>
 and SHFE nickel inventories at year-end declined to 410,828 tonnes 
(from 464,696 tonnes at the beginning of the year). Any further decline 
in visible inventories could give momentum to nickel price increases in 
the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cobalt</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cobalt prices 
strengthened considerably in 2017. The average reference price in the 
fourth quarter was US$31.60 per pound for 2017, up 134% from Q4 2016. 
The average reference cobalt price for the 12-month period of 2017 was 
US$26.53, up 125% from US$11.77 per pound for 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price increase is 
primarily linked to the growing strong demand emanating from the EV 
battery market. The double-digit price growth experienced over the past 
year was also driven by geopolitical and supply risk concerns given that
 the Democratic Republic of Congo is currently the world's largest 
source of cobalt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As cobalt prices have a 
limited impact on overall battery pack costs, high prices are not 
expected to cause supply-chain disruptions or delay EV market growth. As
 a result, the risk of cobalt substitution in EV battery production in 
the near term is relatively low given cobalt's unique <b>energy</b> 
transference properties. While battery manufacturers continue to explore
 alternatives to cobalt, the likely beneficiary of any substitution is 
expected to be Class 1 nickel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cobalt supply deficits 
are expected to continue over the next few years. In addition to demand 
from industrial end users, speculative investors are also driving up 
cobalt prices by stockpiling inventory, further exacerbating supply 
deficit concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moa Joint Venture (50% interest) and Fort Site (100%)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Moa JV produced 4,134
 tonnes of finished nickel in Q4 2017, up from 3,782 tonnes produced in 
Q4 2016, despite mixed sulphides production being negatively impacted by
 abnormally heavy rainfalls in November and December 2017. Finished 
nickel production on a 12-month basis was 15,679 tonnes in 2017, in line
 with expectations for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q4 2017 revenue for the 
Moa JV and the Fort Site totaled $123.0 million, up 32% from $92.5 
million last year. The growth was driven by higher production and higher
 realized prices for nickel, cobalt and fertilizer. Nickel sales 
represented 50% of total Q4 2017 revenue while cobalt sales represented 
33%. Fertilizer sales in Q4 2017 were up 19% from last year, reflecting 
stronger demand and higher realized prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mining, processing and 
refining (MPR) costs for Q4 2017 were US$4.89 per pound, down from 
US$4.93 per pound for Q4 2016. The decline was largely due to higher 
production volumes in Q4 2017. MPR costs on the full-year basis were 
US$4.80 per pound for 2017, up from US$4.63 per pound for 2016. The 
US$0.17 increase per pound in 2017 was attributable to higher <b>energy</b>
 costs, although partly offset by cost savings of approximately US$0.50 
per pound achieved with the commissioning of the third acid plant at Moa
 in the fourth quarter of 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite higher <b>energy</b>
 and sulphur input costs, Moa's NDCC of US$1.80/lb of finished nickel in
 Q4 2017 was the lowest experienced since Q3 2004. The cobalt credit of 
US$3.54/lb reflects Moa's high cobalt to nickel production ratio as well
 as the 125% growth in cobalt prices since Q4 2016. NDCC improvement 
also benefited from the commissioning of a third sulphuric acid plant at
 Moa in 2016 that generated approximate savings of US$0.50/lb. NDCC on a
 12-month basis was $2.35/lb, down from $3.42/lb for 2016. NDCC for 2017
 was significantly lower than expectations for the year, due largely to 
higher cobalt by-product credits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash provided by 
operations in Q4 2017 totaled $32.5 million, up from a loss in Q4 2016 
when Hurricane Matthew and the subsequent collapse of bridge 
infrastructure negatively impacted production. Cash flow from operations
 in Q4 2017 was also positively impacted higher realized nickel and 
cobalt prices..</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moa's sustaining capital 
spending in Q4 2017 was $7.7 million, up from $4.7 million in Q4 last 
year. The increase was attributable to the timing of expenditures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ambatovy Joint Venture (12% interest effective December 11, 2017)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with its partners, 
Sherritt completed the restructuring of the Ambatovy Joint Venture on 
December 11, 2017. The restructuring led to Sherritt's ownership 
interest being reduced to 12% in exchange for the elimination of $1.4 
billion of debt. Sherritt's financial and operational results at 
Ambatovy are presented on a 40% basis to December 10, 2017 and on a 12% 
basis effective December 11, 2017. Sherritt will continue to serve as 
operator of Ambatovy at least through 2024, however, as a result of the 
reduction in its ownership interest, Sherritt's ability to direct local 
decision-making at Ambatovy has diminished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finished nickel 
production at Ambatovy in Q4 2017 was 3,111 tonnes, down from 5,111 
tonnes for the comparable period of 2016, which represented Ambatovy's 
highest ever production total. The year-over-year decline was due to a 
number of developments that impacted plant reliability. Most notably, 
the failure of an economizer in one of the acid plants reduced 
production capacity to approximately 50% during November and December of
 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finished nickel 
production on a 12-month basis for 2017 was 13,618 tonnes, down from 
16,842 tonnes for 2016. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to 
equipment failures that reduced the reliability of Ambatovy's acid plant
 and pressure acid leach circuit. Maintenance activities and replacement
 of equipment completed in 2017 are expected to improve plant 
reliability and production stability over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finished cobalt 
production in Q4 2017 was 245 tonnes, down from 404 tonnes for the same 
period of 2016. The decrease was tied to plant reliability issues 
previously cited that lowered production. Cobalt production for 2017 was
 1,173 tonnes, down from 1,309 tonnes for 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MPR costs for Q4 2017 
were US$5.76 per pound, up from US$3.97 per pound in Q4 2016. MPR costs 
on a full-year basis were US$6.01 per pound in 2017, up from US$4.89 per
 pound in 2016. The year-over-year increases were largely due to higher 
input costs as well as lower production volumes in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NDCC for finished nickel 
at Ambatovy in Q4 2017 was $3.26/lb, up from the $3.10/lb for Q4 2016. 
The increase was due to lower production, higher maintenance costs, 
higher <b>energy</b> and sulphur input costs offset by higher cobalt 
by-product credits. NDCC on a 12-month basis $3.83/lb for 2017, down 
from $4.27/lb for 2016. Ambatovy's NDCC for 2017 places it slightly 
above the 50(th) percentile of industry average cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subsequent to year end, 
facilities at the Ambatovy Joint Venture were impacted by Tropical 
Cyclone Ava, a Category 2 hurricane equivalent storm. Damage to 
equipment and the acid production facilities resulted in a temporary 
halt in production. Repairs have since been completed and partial 
production has resumed. A ramp up in production is expected through the 
end of Q2 2018.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross working-interest 
oil production in Q4 2017 in Cuba was 10,378 barrels of oil per day 
(bopd), down from 14,470 bopd for the comparable period of 2016. The 
decrease was primarily due to the expiration of the Varadero West 
Production Sharing Contract (PSC) in November 2017 and natural reservoir
 declines. Gross working-interest oil production on a 12-month basis for
 2017 was 13,479 bopd, in line with guidance for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue in Q4 2017 was 
$27.7 million, down 9% from $30.6 million for last year. The decline was
 due to lowered production, partially offset by an increase in realized 
prices of 23% to $48.82 per barrel in Cuba, though partially offset by 
the negative impact of a stronger Canadian dollar. Revenue on a 
full-year basis was $127.0 million, up 17%. The increase was driven 
largely by higher realized prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total net working 
interest production for Q4 2017 was 6,101 barrels of oil equivalent per 
day, down from 8,163 barrels in the same period of 2016. The decline was
 due to lower cost-recovery spending, the impact of the expiration of 
the Varadero West PSC already cited and the impact of higher oil prices 
in the current year period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unit operating costs in 
Q4 2017 in Cuba were $12.24 per barrel, up 12% from $10.95 in Q4 2016, 
driven largely by reduced production. On a full-year basis, unit costs 
in Cuba were $9.78 in line with 2017 guidance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capital spending in Q4 
2017 totaled $7.2 million and was largely focused on Block 10 drilling

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DON MARTIN: Welcome back.
 Our Wednesday trio of MPs spanning the party divide are here for their 
always respectful analysis of each other's flawed logic. Candice Bergen 
is the official opposition house leader, Tracey Ramsey NDP MP from 
lovely Essex, and Steve MacKinnon is a government parliamentary 
secretary of procurement. All right, welcome to you all.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STEVEN MACKINNON (Liberal – Quebec): Public services and procurement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: That too. If you want to buy something from the government, you got to go to Steve, basically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: Well, no, no, no. Not quite. Not quite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Let's talk about 
this pipeline feud. We spent a lot of time on it on the show already, 
but I find this a really intriguing story. I don't know which side the 
NDP is on. BC, Alberta, what's your position, Tracey? Help me understand
 it, because I couldn't figure it out from your leader today?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TRACEY RAMSEY (NDP – 
Ontario): Well Rachel Notley is doing the job that she's been elected to
 do, and she is the premier with the most advanced I would say climate 
change plan that we have in our country right now. And John Horgan is 
also doing the job that he's been elected to do. What we see in the NDP 
federally is that Justin Trudeau is not doing what he promised. He's 
broken a promise to Canadians about the process. He promised to have a 
new environmental assessment process. He promised to talk about <b>social license</b>.
 And what do we see in Nanaimo last week at the town hall with him is 
that people in BC do not feel that he has done that, and we federally 
know that he has not done that. This is a broken promise about something
 that he made a commitment to standing in BC repeatedly throughout the 
election campaign. So this really is on the prime minister because he's 
now approved a project in this broken process, and he's using a little 
bit of some addressing some of the very serious issues that exist around
 the ocean protection as blackmail now about this pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: I'm trying to 
figure out where you are. Should the pipeline proceed, or should the 
pipeline be stopped? If you had to choose "A" or "B", which would it be?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RAMSEY: For myself, I'm 
not going to choose "A" or "B" because this is about the provinces 
coming to what is best for them, and it's also about the federal 
government stepping in and playing a role here. Let's start the 
assessment process over. If Justin Trudeau is so convinced that this 
assessment process is the right way to go, then restart the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: They're going to do that tomorrow though aren't they? You're not starting the process over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: We committed 
to indeed redo the environmental assessment process. It is flawed, and 
we will be announcing in the fullness of time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Tomorrow anyway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: Amendments to that process. Let's recap though. On <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>, we had an enhanced process where we put a panel on top of prior <span class="companylink">NEB</span> review of the panel. We had Aboriginal involvement. We had involvement of former prominent British Columbians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: But now we're at a stalemate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: Well, no, 
we're not at a stalemate. In fact we are at the culmination. This 
project has been approved. We wish to see it through. It is in the 
national interest. All of those things have been determined, have been 
determined by a constitutionally valid process, and we're doing three 
things, Don. We know that we have to get alternative and diverse markets
 for our <b>energy</b> resources. We know that a lot of our prosperity 
depends on that. We also know that you don't have to decide between the 
environment and the economy, because we've put in place a national 
climate framework with a carbon tax. We've put in a national oceans 
protection plan, $1.5 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: One law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: Well, no, these are important points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Well what's Trudeau's next step is what I'm asking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: These are important points to make. MARTIN: Jump in here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CANDICE BERGEN 
(Conservative House Leader): Where is the prime minister? We are on the 
verge of what could be a crisis between two governments, two provincial 
governments. We also have a pipeline that has been approved that is in 
the best interests of Canadians. It's certainly in the best interests of
 jobs for Canadians. We need the prime minister. Where is he? He's 
travelling around the US right now. He's in California talking about 
diversity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Chicago today, California tomorrow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BERGEN: He should be in 
Canada. Sorry, excuse me. Oh, I just saw his itinerary. It was a speech 
on diversity tomorrow. He should be in Canada. He should be talking to 
the premier of British Columbia. He should be taking and asserting 
leadership on this. This is in the national interest. You know, we saw 
the last time the prime minister was too afraid to talk to a municipal 
leader, it was Denis Coderre who didn't like <b>Energy</b> East, and the prime minister refused to stand up for pipelines in general, certainly he didn't say anything about <b>Energy</b> East, and the Liberal policies killed <b>Energy</b>
 East. Here's the problem and the real risk. If this pipeline is 
delayed, if Trans Mountain is delayed for too long, at some point the 
proponents go, you know what, we're outta here. That is a very real 
possibility. We need leadership. We need the prime minister to get home 
and to do his job for Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: This project has been permitted. It is in the national interest, and it will proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Okay. I don't want to go on. Mercedes Stephenson, our <span class="companylink">CTV</span>
 superstar here, had a very interesting story last night that actually 
got some new traction in question period today. Basically there's a 
class-action suit that's going forward by potentially thousands of 
soldiers, male and female, mostly female, who are saying that they were 
sexually harassed, or discriminated against, or maybe even assaulted in 
some cases. This case, the legal department, the government's legal 
department is arguing that it doesn't have an obligation to provide a 
harassment-free work force for the individual. Steve, help me understand
 why you would argue that position, because it sounds like you ran away 
from it today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: Two important 
points. First of all, let's remember operation honour, the chief of the 
defence staff, the minister. Certainly this culture, if I can call it 
that, has seemed to grow over time, and it is a major challenge for the 
Canadian Armed Forces. I think that's been acknowledged, and I think 
that that's the product of many years, and we're tackling that head-on. 
Dozens of people have been released from the forces, and there have been
 major consequences, so that work continues apace, and I think the 
minister and others deserve praise for that, and I'm sure my colleagues 
would agree. With respect to the court case, it was fairly clear that in
 a pleading, some of the government's lawyers put in a phrase that did 
not accurately capture how the government feels about its custodial 
requirements over members of the armed forces, and the prime minister 
made that very clear and is instructing the attorney general.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Speaking of that, let's hear what the prime minister had to say. This is what Justin Trudeau said earlier today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
JUSTIN TRUDEAU (Canadian Prime Minister): News this morning that there 
were concerns about what the Justice Department is arguing in a sexual 
harassment case around the military is something that is of concern to 
me, and I've asked the attorney general to follow up with the lawyers to
 make sure that we argue things that are consistent with this 
government's philosophy. Obviously what the lawyers have been arguing 
does not align with what my belief, or what this government believes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: I guess some people would say he's speaking one way in the court of public opinion and another way in a court of law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BERGEN: This is another 
example, and there's just becoming such a long list of examples where 
the prime minister's actions don't line up with his words. The fact is 
the prime minister put together a committee of his own cabinet 
ministers, seven cabinet ministers, including the justice minister, to 
actually look at litigation and to put it through the political and the 
belief lens. His cabinet ministers, his minister of justice would have 
signed off on this. What this boils down to, and we see this in this 
government, where their words don't line up, and so the prime minister 
talks about creating a safe workplace, he talks about addressing sexual 
harassment, but when it's really, when it's tough, when he has to 
actually step up, and his government has to step up and do it, we see 
this argument, and his own cabinet would have signed off on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Tracey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RAMSEY: This is a blow to
 the work that's been done over the past month and over the past week in
 a nonpartisan way inside the house. We've been having conversations 
about guaranteeing a harassment-free workplace, and then we have 
something like this come out where lawyers are essentially saying that 
our military does not deserve that. It's not something that they are 
entitled to. This is bizarre to have the lawyers come out, and I think 
that knowing that ministers have seen this, that they're aware of this, 
and then this to come forward, it does such a disservice to the great 
work that we're trying to do inside this house for all Canadians. It's 
unacceptable that people in our military are being told that they do not
 deserve a harassment-free workplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: There's also been
 another bit of a backtrack today. The government did approve the sale 
of a bunch of Bell helicopters built just in Quebec to the Philippines. 
This is a country where human rights records and how they treat drug 
trafficking and that sort of thing has been a big conflict. So it was 
exposed, and now it sounds, Steve, if I'm not mistaking it, the 
government is going to reconsider this. Is that what we're talking 
about?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: Well, no. In fact we have not approved a sale of helicopters to the Philippines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: That's news to the Philippines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: If such a sale
 occurred, it did not occur on our watch, and although we do 
diplomatically engage with Philippines, I know the minister when she was
 there raised human rights, or possible human rights violations that may
 have occurred in the Philippines, and obviously we want to ensure that 
Canadian equipment is not used in such ways, so the <span class="companylink">government of Canada</span> will continue to watch this. But to be very clear, the <span class="companylink">government of Canada</span> did not, the current <span class="companylink">government of Canada</span> did not approve the sale of these helicopters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Tracey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RAMSEY: So here's this 
thing. This isn't about a permit, an export permit, because these were 
actually done through the defence department. So this is a government 
department that this has happened through, and it was a direct sale 
versus having an export permit. So I don't, I think that what's been 
identified to everyone is that we have a process that is full of holes. 
We have loopholes that we've created where we can have certain 
departments, an export permit here, different processes being applied. 
We have to stop exporting to countries with massive human rights 
violations. It's unacceptable to Canadians. Canadians do not want this 
to be on our reputation on the global stage, and the Liberals cannot 
hide behind saying that their government didn't do this. They have to 
overhaul the process. It's something that the NDP has been calling for, 
and we have to ensure that we know where our helicopters are going, when
 we have Duterte who's saying basically at one point he threw someone 
out of a helicopter. Like this is so egregious. It's very concerning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: It's a tough one, you know, because there's big economic impacts for these contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BERGEN: Well here's the 
challenge. And I mean under a previous governments there is a process 
whereby these types of sales are looked at and either approved or 
denied. The problem is it creates a lot of jobs in Canada, and a lot of 
this equipment is going to be purchased from the UK, from Germany, from 
Australia, from other countries, and so, you know, for sure, if there 
are ways that we can tighten up and ensure that our equipment is not 
being misused, definitely, but I think it would be irresponsible to say 
that to our, it would be irresponsible to our aerospace industry, to a 
lot of industries in Canada that create a lot of jobs that we just won't
 sell anything anymore to a country that may not be in line with our 
human rights record, even though very big concerns definitely with what 
would be done with those helicopters, but it has to be looked at 
carefully and you can't throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: To be clear, Canada would never approve a sale where human rights violations were... MARTIN: Saudi Arabia?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: ...were preemptively anticipated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: You are late for a vote, you three, so I'm going to let you go, even though... BERGEN: Are we too boring for you, Don?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: You're great. You got to vote. You're the house leader so you should probably be in the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BERGEN: Well that's right, I better get there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: All right, thank you all. We'll see you next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: Thanks, Don.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BERGEN: Thanks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RAMSEY: Thanks.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The annual <b>Energy</b> New Ventures competition effectively deconstructs the myth that innovation isn't happening in the <b>energy</b> sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is. And it's happening in the startup ecosystem, driven by individuals who might once have worked within the giant corporate <b>energy</b> infrastructure but are now on the outside and seeking to do things better, faster and cheaper.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's fifth annual competition, sponsored by the <span class="companylink">University of Calgary</span>'s
 Hunter Hub for Entrepreneurial Thinking, saw companies pitch ideas to 
tackle some of the grand challenges facing the oilpatch. Those would 
include everything from emissions management and water treatment to the 
use of data analytics to optimize production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A day earlier, the issue of <b>energy</b>
 sector innovation was raised by Kelly Craft, the U.S. Ambassador to 
Canada, and Canadian Ambassador to the U.S. David MacNaughton during a 
discussion hosted by the <span class="companylink"><b>Energy</b> Council of Canada</span> in Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Craft highlighted how 
innovation and technology has unlocked oil and natural gas reserves in 
the U.S. She also mentioned - several times - the importance of research
 and innovation to the <b>energy</b> future of the continent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Innovation is something Canada, the United States and Mexico have agreed is critical to further North America's vast <b>energy</b> resources," said Craft, while relating how <span class="companylink">Natural Resources Canada</span> officials recently visited the U.S. National Lab in Berkley, Calif. to explore future opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She went on to tout the economic benefits, backed by research from consulting firm <span class="companylink">IHS</span> that demonstrated how every state is benefiting from growth in the <b>energy</b> sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's an observation British Columbians and Premier John Horgan need to understand. They, too, benefit from Alberta's <b>energy</b> sector, as does all of Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower prices for <b>energy</b> - means a better price at the pumps for consumers and as feedstocks for petrochemical plants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a bit of an unintended slap, however, when Craft referenced how <span class="companylink">Nova Chemicals</span>
 is investing in its Ontario petrochemical plant after securing a 
low-cost feedstock - natural gas from the Utica and Marcellus plays 
south of the border.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That one hurt. It should be natural gas from the west supplying that plant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Craft also emphasized the
 Trump administration's efforts to streamline the permitting process for
 new infrastructure to capitalize on the economic opportunity. That 
particular message seems to get lost in Canada, especially between B.C. 
and Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's ambassador picked up the thread of innovation and the need for progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I do not believe in going backwards, but I think we face so many challenges ... not just in the <b>energy</b>
 sector," said MacNaughton. "By standing still, we will fall behind. I 
am more ambitious. There are new challenges that we face in the <b>energy</b> world ... that means that we do need to update what we are doing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We also need to 
collaborate a lot more on how we get ... community acceptance for things
 like pipelines and major infrastructure."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two ambassadors, along with presenters at the <b>Energy</b>
 New Ventures event, also expressed the need to move away from the "if 
it ain't broke, don't fix it" mentality that's pervasive in terms of 
trade and <b>energy</b> companies experimenting with new technology and processes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latter has gotten 
better, largely due to the oil price collapse that forced change within 
the sector. Yet there still remains a view that innovation means doing 
the same thing, only cheaper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also interesting to 
hear from those pushing the innovation boundaries that the differences 
between the speed at which decisions are made to try new technologies in
 the U.S. versus in Canada. The consensus is there's a greater appetite 
in the U.S. to take risks associated with a new idea, process or 
technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That raises a number of 
questions, including whether some of the disincentive lies in the 
regulatory approval process. There is also the practical matter of how 
the innovators survive, even when they have a viable process or idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One challenge is that big
 companies make investment decisions that can stretch out over decades. 
The startup or tech company wants to sign a deal in the short term, to 
either validate a process or technology, or because they're ready to 
launch their product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There remains a 
disconnect between the sense of urgency to support continued innovation -
 that makes the sector strong, and helps to give it the necessary '<b>social license</b>'- and the long term investment horizons of companies in a position to adopt new technologies but reticent to take the risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <b>energy</b> sector 
has been disrupted by technology. Without it the U.S. wouldn't have 
reached record oil production, as it did last week. The challenge is to 
be part of the next wave of disruption - and not left watching from the 
sidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, companies 
that pitched their ideas to private equity and venture capital investors
 from Calgary and Vancouver reflected the activity taking place within 
the oilpatch and make the sector more competitive and able to address 
the environmental challenges. It's also working to align its values with

John Horgan's NDP government announced rules that would effectively ban

pending a scientific safety study whose results we can already guess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.C. is effectively declaring <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>

groups - is to force the company to cancel the project. They even raise 
the specter of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> completing the expansion, and then finding itself forbidden to turn on the tap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley said Tuesday she 
knew B.C. was about to announce some kind of review, but had no idea 
this ban would be part of it. She attacked the action(

 ) as illegal, unconstitutional, and contrary to trade pacts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley went on to say: 
"I'm not pulling any punches. This is bad for British Columbia, this is 
bad for Alberta, this is bad for Canada." She called the move "political
 game-playing and political theatre."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She's right on every 
count - but those are just words, not punches. What will Notley actually
 do to influence a government that clearly has no respect for other 
authorities, or even federal powers under the constitution?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have no idea, because all she's ever said is that Alberta is in the right, and the legal process will prevail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the process isn't 
prevailing. It's failing. Horgan's main interest appears to be holding 
the co-operation of the B.C. Greens, whose three legislature votes keep 
him in office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has vowed to use 
everything in the provincial toolbox to block the pipeline. If he runs 
out of tools, he just invents a new one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no shred of party
 friendship here. Horgan clearly doesn't care if his actions help defeat
 the only other NDP government in Canada.</p>

supporters after being sworn in as member of Calgary-Lougheed in the 
Chamber at the Alberta Legislature in Edmonton, January 29, 2018. Ed 
Kaiser/Postmedia</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UCP Leader Jason Kenney pounced at a news conference Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He called the B.C. action "another attack on Alberta's <b>energy</b> industry by New Democrats - by Rachel Notley's friends and fellow travelers, a party in B.C. for which she used to work."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's extremely 
embarrassing for our premier that she has been unable to persuade her 
fellow New Democrats to stop this attack on our province's economy and 
on free trade within Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's also unfortunate 
that the Prime Minister (Justin Trudeau) has been unable to stop this 
attack on the economic union within Canada."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One knock on Notley is 
that she puts too much faith in the goodwill of others. She imposed a 
carbon tax and stringent carbon standards, partly for serious 
environmental reasons, but also to win "<b>social license</b>" for pipelines from other Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If she is doubly betrayed
 - if Ottawa doesn't resolve this, and B.C. keeps throwing spike belts 
on the highway - her chances of re-election are virtually zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday Kenney rather 
tamely demanded a court challenge to the new B.C. rules, but in the past
 he's threatened retaliatory trade action if B.C. continues to be 
obstructive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Trade is a two-way 
street, and if I were premier and the government of British Columbia 
were blocking one of our prime exports, we would find ways to respond in
 kind that would be an economic response," he said last Aug. 4.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a great deal 
that British Columbia depends on that comes from Alberta. We'll find 
whatever points of leverage are necessary to demonstrate that a province
 cannot do that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley doesn't threaten 
any specific action. She perhaps hopes that Horgan is just playing to 
his base until Ottawa inevitably lowers the hammer and the pipeline goes
 ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at this point, it's foolish just to express outrage and hope it all works out.</p>

two pools, with the unrisked high estimate being 8.07 million boe (92.6%
 Oil), a best estimate of 6.136 million boe (91.3% Oil) and a low 
estimate of 3.668 million boe (89.1% Oil).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, the 
Resource Assessment prepared by Sproule calculated risked contingent 
resources where the risked assessment assigned a 77% chance of Pulse 
proceeding with the EOR project (see Table 2 below) and resulting in a 
best estimate of risked contingent resources net to Pulse of 4.694 
million boe (91.2% Oil).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Cadenhead, Chief 
Operating Officer of Pulse, commented, "The Sproule Resource Assessment 
is a positive independent commercial confirmation for our Bigoray Nisku 
Enhanced Oil Recovery project. Although this assessment used a more 
conservative approach to Petroleum Initially in-Place ("PIIP") compared 
with the PIIP estimates of the Alberta <b>Energy</b> Regulator, we are 
excited to see that even this more conservative approach resulted in a 
strong endorsement for the project. With an independent un-risked high 
case upside estimated at over 8 million boe's of contingent resources 
(92% oil), the opportunity to move forward with our EOR project to&nbsp;
 bring on stream substantial cashflow while targeting to recover those 
types of oil volumes without drilling a well, creates a substantial 
opportunity to enhance value for Pulse and our shareholders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Resource Assessment 
focussed exclusively on two Nisku pools only in the Bigoray area, and 
included just 2,720 acres of Pulse's 44,720 acre core area holdings 
which includes 14,000 acres at Bigoray alone. Future evaluations may be 
done on Pulse's Mannville, Cardium and Pekisko formations that are 
thought to also provide significant growth opportunities for the Company
 as well as additional Nisku assets/pools held within Pulse's existing 
holdings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cadenhead further 
added, "As part of the Resource Assessment, the evaluator assessed a 
total risk of 77% that the project would proceed, citing economic 
factors and/or timing of development as one of the only risks associated
 with the project. All technical risks such as evaluation drilling, 
regulatory approvals, technology, legal factors, infrastructure and 
markets, political factors and social licence were all assigned 100% 
chance of commerciality.&nbsp;Our goal is to make this project happen in
 2018 and with the oil price market appreciating heading into 2018, the 
economics of this EOR project and return for shareholders continue to 
look more and more attractive alongside improving oil prices." 
&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Resource Assessment 
is based on the results from seventeen wells and, where available, core 
data. Where core was not available, the assessment considered log data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resource 
volumes for these discovered resources have been classified as 
'development unclarified' with Sproule assessing that there is a high 
probability of the Bigoray EOR project becoming a commercial 
development. Pulse will continue to complete project planning associated
 with the project and move forward with its execution plans in 
2018.&nbsp;</p>

factors relevant to the estimate of Pulse's contingent resources from 
the Bigoray EOR project include success of miscible flood development in
 nearby analogous Nisku reservoirs, a discovered thick oil column 
providing volumes for the deployment of enhanced oil recovery through a 
miscible flood and a nearby infrastructure allowing for access to 
market. Significant negative factors relevant to the estimate of Pulse's
 contingent resources from the Bigoray EOR project include uncertainty 
to how the previously fully waterflooded pools will respond to a

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulse is a Canadian 
company incorporated Under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta) and 
has plans to become a leading oil and gas company. Pulse has recently 
completed four transactions to consolidate its interests in the Bigoray 
area of Alberta, resulting in 100% control of Pulse's Bigoray operations
 that include two Nisku oil Pinnacle Reefs. Pulse is moving forward to 
grow production and execute an Enhanced Oil Recovery project to unlock 
significant value for shareholders through control of approximately 65 
net sections of land across the Mannville, Cardium, Pekisko/Shunda and 
Nisku trends in Western Canada.&nbsp;Pulse will focus on acquiring 
affordable, small to medium sized proven oil and gas assets with 
significant upside. The Company plans to achieve further growth through 
low-risk, technically diligent drilling, infrastructure ownership and 
reserve growth utilizing proven enhanced oil recovery techniques and 
implementation of technology.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resource Definitions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resources encompasses all
 petroleum quantities that originally existed on or within the earth's 
crust in naturally occurring accumulations, including Discovered and 
Undiscovered (recoverable and unrecoverable) plus quantities already 
produced. "Total Resources" is equivalent to "Total Petroleum Initially 
In-Place". Resources are classified in the following categories:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total Petroleum Initially
 In-Place ("TPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is estimated to 
exist originally in naturally occurring accumulations. It includes that 
quantity of petroleum that is estimated, as of a given date, to be 
contained in known accumulations, prior to production, plus those 
estimated quantities in accumulations yet to be discovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovered Petroleum 
Initially In-Place ("DPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is 
estimated, as of a given date, to be contained in known accumulations 
prior to production. The recoverable portion of DPIIP includes 
production, reserves, and Contingent Resources; the remainder is 
unrecoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources are 
those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established 
technology or technology under development but which are not currently 
considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more 
contingencies. Economic Contingent Resources (ECR) are those contingent 
resources that are currently economically recoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undiscovered Petroleum 
Initially In Place ("UPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is 
estimated, on a given date, to be contained in accumulations yet to be 
discovered. The recoverable portion of UPIIP is referred to as 
Prospective Resources and the remainder is unrecoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective Resources are
 those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application 
of future development projects. Prospective Resources have both an 
associated chance of discovery and a chance of development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unrecoverable is that 
portion of DPIIP and UPIIP quantities which is estimated, as of a given 
date, not to be recoverable by future development projects. A portion of
 these quantities may become recoverable in the future as commercial 
circumstances change or technological developments occur; the remaining 
portion may never be recovered due to the physical/chemical constraints 
represented by subsurface interaction of fluids and reservoir rocks. 
Uncertainty Ranges are described by the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation 
Handbook as low, best, and high estimates for reserves and resources as 
follows:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low Estimate: This is 
considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities
 recovered will exceed the low estimate. If probabilistic methods are 
used, there should be at least a 90 percent probability (P90) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the low estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best Estimate: This is 
considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will actually be
 recovered. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities 
recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate. If 
probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50 percent 
probability (P50) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or 
exceed the best estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High Estimate: This is 
considered to be an optimistic estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual remaining 
quantities recovered will exceed the high estimate. If probabilistic 
methods are used, there should be at least a 10 percent probability 
(P10) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the 
high estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development Unclarified 
is a project maturity sub-class of contingent resources that refers to 
the development plan evaluation is not complete and there is ongoing 
activity to resolve any risks or uncertainties.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certain resource estimate
 volumes disclosed herein are arithmetic sums of multiple estimates of 
DPIIP or UPIIP, which statistical principles indicate may be misleading 
as to volumes that may actually be recovered. Readers should give 
attention to the estimates of individual classes of resources and

class as explained under this&nbsp;Resource Definitions&nbsp;section.</p>

 a perverse kind of way, this week's 50-per-cent increase in Alberta's 
unpopular carbon tax - to $30 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions - 
could be a big gift from Rachel Notley's NDP government to her opponent,
 United Conservative Party (UCP) opposition leader Jason Kenney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase means the province now ties British Columbia for having the highest carbon tax in the country.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in Alberta it stings as the province uses more <b>energy</b> for heating and transportation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost in a typical 
Alberta household of a $30 a tonne tax is $667 a year, compared to $362 
in the typical B.C. household, according to a study by Jennifer Winter, 
an <b>energy</b> economist at the University of Calgary's school of 
public policy. At $50 a tonne, the annual cost is $1,111 in Alberta and 
$603 in B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's no small change in a
 lousy provincial economy with high unemployment. Polls consistently 
show strong disapproval of the tax, which piles on top of higher taxes 
and increased environmental regulations that are depressing job creation
 in the oil and gas sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's hefty carbon 
tax is one of the big pieces of the province's climate leadership plan, 
pushed through by Notley's government when Alberta's conservatives were 
in disarray and political implications seemed remote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question is whether 
Albertans embrace the tough medicine and its benefits, as claimed by the
 government, or will slam the door on the tax grab when they return to 
the polls next year. That's what the UCP, which reunited conservatives 
last year and picked Kenney to lead them, is counting on. Meanwhile, the
 duelling views are clashing hard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">University of Calgary 
economics professor Trevor Tombe said the carbon tax is controversial 
because it's visible in heating bills and at the pumps and because of 
its negative economic impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even government estimates show it shrinks GDP and deters employment, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the plan, the tax 
increases to $50 a tonne by 2022 to line up with federal goals. But 
other provinces are taking longer to ramp up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carbon is priced at $19 a tonne in the cap and trade market in Quebec and Ontario.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Provinces without carbon 
pricing are subject to the federal carbon price, which starts at $10 per
 tonne in 2018 and rises by $10 per year to $50 per tonne in 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta NDP says the 
benefits of its carbon tax include economic diversification away from 
oil and gas, job creation from greener jobs, emissions reductions, tax 
rebates for those with lower incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, green job 
creation hasn't offset the estimated 100,000 oil and gas jobs lost over 
the last three years, partly due to Alberta's climate change plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cheryl Oates, communications director for Notley, said 2,000 jobs have been created from <b>energy</b>
 efficiency programs so far and another 1,300 jobs are expected. The 
recently announced winning bidders of renewable electricity projects are
 expected to create another 740 jobs, with 7,000 jobs overall expected 
in new renewable <b>energy</b> by 2030.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province estimates it
 will collect $1.038 billion in revenue from the tax in fiscal 2017-18, 
rising to $1.396 billion in 2018-2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All revenue from carbon pricing is reinvested back into Alberta's economy to reduce emissions, support renewable <b>energy</b> and help Alberta families and businesses adjust to the price of carbon," said Oates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government also 
argues that even with the increase in carbon pricing, Alberta has an 
overall tax advantage compared to other provinces because it has no 
provincial sales tax, health premium or payroll tax. It estimates 
Albertans and Alberta businesses will still pay at least $8.7 billion 
less in total taxes and carbon charges than if the province had the same
 tax system and carbon pricing as other provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney says he would 
immediately repeal the "job killing tax" if elected premier - and at the
 same time put a big dent in the federal government's own climate change
 plan, which relies on Alberta toeing the line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Alberta families and 
jobcreators have suffered enough under this NDP government, and now they
 have to endure a 50 per cent increase in a carbon tax that hasn't 
converted a single opponent of Alberta's <b>energy</b> industry into a supporter," Kenney said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The carbon tax was supposed to buy '<b>social license</b>'for
 pipelines to get built. Instead, since the NDP announced its plan, 
Justin Trudeau vetoed approved Northern Gateway, Barack Obama vetoed 
Keystone XL, the <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span> effectively killed <b>Energy</b>
 East, and the NDP government in B.C. is doing everything it can to 
block TransMountain. Not one single government, party, or special 
interest group has gone from 'no'to 'yes'on pipelines as a result of the
 NDP's failed tax on everything."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the trend continues, 
and the two remaining pipeline projects aren't built, Notley would hand 
her political opponents another big gift by showing the tax is all pain 
and no gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this time, the odds 
are hard to call because the future of both Keystone XL and the Trans 
Mountain expansion depend on the resolution of legal disputes with

 New Year's Day, the NDP hiked its job-killing carbon tax by 50 per 
cent, increasing the cost of virtually everything from home heating to 
groceries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The NDP carbon tax has 
already killed thousands of good-paying jobs, put hardworking Alberta 
entrepreneurs out of business, and made life more expensive families 
across the province," said United Conservative Leader Jason Kenney. 
"Today, despite never having mentioned a carbon tax during the 2015 
election, the NDP digs even deeper into the pockets of everyday 
Albertans."</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The
 carbon tax is all economic pain with no environmental gain. As the 
architect of the NDP's carbon tax plan himself admitted, the tax drives 
emissions to jurisdictions that do not have a carbon tax. Albertans 
understand this: despite the Government spending millions of tax dollars
 trying to buy support for their carbon tax, polls consistently show 
high disapproval for the NDP's plan."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Carbon Tax was supposed to buy '<b>social license</b>'for
 pipelines to get built. Instead, since the NDP announced its plan, 
Justin Trudeau vetoed approved Northern Gateway, Barack Obama vetoed 
Keystone XL, the <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span> effectively killed <b>Energy</b>
 East, and the NDP government in BC is doing everything it can to block 
TransMountain. Not one single government, party, or special interest 
group has gone from 'no'to 'yes'on pipelines as a result of the NDP'a 
failed tax on everything."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Punishing Albertans with
 this tax is not an environmental strategy. Seniors can only turn down 
the heat at home by so much, and people can't stop driving to work. 
That's why countries around the world are going in the opposite 
direction, like Australia's recent carbon tax repeal, and the United 
States, where voters have consistently opposed carbon taxes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Alberta families and 
jobcreators have suffered enough under this NDP government, and now they
 have to endure a 50 per cent increase in a carbon tax that hasn't 
converted a single opponent of Alberta's <b>energy</b> industry into a 
supporter. To make matters worse, the NDP has promised a further 67 per 
cent increase should they be re-elected in 2019."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The United Conservatives
 will work tirelessly in 2018 to ensure that the damage inflicted on 
Albertans by the disastrous NDP is reversed. Indeed, the first bill of a
 United Conservative Government will be the 'Carbon Tax Repeal Act,'" 
concluded Kenney.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian natural resources industry is undergoing enormous change. Volatile <b>energy</b>
 prices — the reality of US 55 per barrel — reduced production 
reliability, uncertain market access, the government’s climate change 
agenda, tightening environmental policy, safety, and compliance concerns
 along with increasing social drivers, such as <b>social license</b> to operate, all have resulted in industry upheaval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There seems to be a 
consensus that technological innovation is now more critical than ever 
to maintain the competitiveness of the oil and gas industry. According 
to Deloitte, “The industry is at a critical juncture where companies 
must go beyond merely acknowledging the need to innovate and start 
executing upon this imperative in a systematic way or else their 
long-term survival may be in jeopardy.”&nbsp;1</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At
 the same time, according to the Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance 
(COSIA), when speaking to Canada’s standing committee on natural 
resources, “While some technologies are already in or nearing 
commercialization, many, especially the more transformative ones, could 
take more than a decade to become available for deployment. There is 
about a 10-year time horizon from ideation to commercial deployment in 
the oil and gas sector.”&nbsp;2</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How does the industry 
pursue innovation to drive real business value realization, find more 
innovative ways to cut costs, increase revenues, create more productive 
solutions in exploration and development, and make better decisions on 
operational risk — all while accelerating the pace to commercial 
deployment?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For starters, we work 
together. It sounds like a cliché but when key players, producers, 
research and technology innovators come together, the opportunity to 
vastly accelerate common industry agendas is realized. The healthcare 
industry is a perfect example of such transformative innovation through 
shared agendas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transformative technology like AI, advanced algorithms, machine-learning and cloud systems — powered by the <span class="companylink">IBM</span>
 Watson platform — made its first impact in healthcare in 2012 starting 
with oncology — the study and treatment of cancer and tumors. Why 
healthcare? Two reasons: First, human health impacts us all, and second,
 the amount of data in the global healthcare industry is massive and AI 
systems like <span class="companylink">IBM</span> Watson are built for 
big data challenges. Medical journals, clinical studies, medical text 
books, x-ray and scanning film, and personal healthcare records are full
 of important data, and the healthcare industry shares a common agenda —
 to deliver the best possible care to patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With this in mind, key healthcare organizations and <span class="companylink">IBM</span>
 came together to build an oncology treatment advisor. Watson ingested 
millions of pieces of structured, unstructured and complex data — from 
both public and private sources — and dramatically changed the face of 
patient care. From there, <span class="companylink">IBM</span> Watson 
and other industries joined forces to accelerate the pace of advancing 
common industry challenges within the banking and insurance, 
manufacturing, retail, education and yes, the oil and gas and mining 
industries, to drive real innovation across the value chain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Secondly, when industry 
players work together on shared agendas, they also align current 
research, expertise and emergent technology solutions to existing 
challenges to accelerate immediate term profitability goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notice we’re focusing on 
immediate term? We all know that when economic climates constrain, the 
focus rapidly turns to short-term performance as uncertainty drives up 
risk in longer-term innovation and capital project commitments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-investment in shared 
industry programs delivers benefits almost impossible to reap as 
individual organizations, such as reduced project and development 
resources, reduced costs associated with common deployment environments,
 lower cost recovery thresholds and the benefit of higher reusability of
 program components and artifacts that reduces the need for redundant or
 new work efforts for each project initiation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirdly, when industry 
players come together to form common agendas, they can more broadly 
capitalize on technological innovation and research such as the Internet
 of Things (IoT) and connected operations, predictive analytics, 
blockchain, cloud and AI. To be an innovator, you need to take risk, and
 with risk comes increased liability and the possibility of failure. 
According to the <span class="companylink">World Economic Forum</span>, 
“the global oil and gas industry has at least 10 years to go before 
reaching a similar level of digital maturity to aerospace or 
automotive.”3</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The natural resources 
industry has access to a tremendous amount of valuable data, technology 
and research capabilities. They are very good at collecting data, and 
the growth in data management service providers in the oil and gas 
industry supports this data collection; However, in the last five to ten
 years the growth in computing power and advanced technologies to 
capitalize and draw insight, understanding and predictions from 
historical data, and public data sources, has not been fully realized. 
The oil and gas industry still struggles with turning data into 
actionable insights that drive faster, safer and more intelligent work. 
The evolution of the industry from outdated legacy systems — not capable
 of handling the data and computer processing power available today — to
 more powerful operational focusses enabled digital systems will take 
time, effort, capital and most of all, a significant cultural change in 
the way the industry works and operates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imperative to the 
industry is the evolution to a modern operational architecture that can 
ingest the “4 V’s” of data — volume, variety, velocity and veracity — 
from internal and external sources, then integrate that insight into 
enterprise processes and workflows for meaningful outcomes. The 
advancement of AI platforms focused in specific industry verticals over 
the last five years, enables computing systems and AI to focus on 
simplifying the intensive processes and complexity in data collection 
and information retrieval, and even predictions, allowing the geologists
 and engineers to make better judgment calls and actions based on their 
experience and the new insights AI brings to their data sets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strategic enablement of digital technologies in the oil and gas industry is now fundamental to its survival. At <span class="companylink">IBM</span>, we believe there is a place for shared agendas to advance innovation through digital transformation. We’ve just launched the <span class="companylink">IBM</span>
 Watson for Natural Resources Innovation program in the Canadian oil and
 gas industry. This 4-year, thirty million dollar value creation program
 will advance business transformation and focus on a collaborative

46-year-old hockey-playing oilfield worker connecting a hose to a valve

Crawford's body struggles to complete its most basic tasks: chew food, 
swallow, taste, smell, speak properly, breathe clearly and sleep 
soundly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I eat everything through a mashed-up liquid diet,” he says. “I haven't smelled or tasted or eaten since the accident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a day that I relive every day,” he says. “With the medications, treatments, doctors, I relive that day every day.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No Saskatchewan 
government investigation followed and regulators took no actions in 
Crawford's case. The near-fatal accident appears nowhere in the 
province's incident database because the companies involved never 
reported it to authorities responsible for protecting public health and 
holding industry accountable, an investigation into oil industry safety 
by the Toronto Star, Global News and National Observer has found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ongoing investigation, which also includes students from journalism programs at Ryerson, Regina, Concordia the <span class="companylink">University of British Columbia</span>,
 has obtained documents through freedom of information laws that detail 
growing safety concerns about H2S, also known as sour gas, dating back 
to 2012. Those documents were never made public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province only learned of the incident that felled Crawford after receiving questions from reporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's disappointing we 
were not advised,” a provincial spokesperson wrote in a statement last 
week, declining an interview. “Valuable lessons may have been lost

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province also says it is investigating the operators of the facility where the incident took place — owned by <span class="companylink">Cona Resources Ltd</span>. (formerly <span class="companylink">Northern Blizzard Resources Inc</span>.) — “to determine whether there was a breach of the regulations related to incident reporting.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cona officials declined 
repeated interview requests. In a statement, president and CEO Rob 
Morgan said the company never completed an investigation because it “did
 not receive nor was able to independently verify” information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Company officials, 
according to the statement, did assess equipment at the site that showed
 “between zero and a trace amount” of H2S. “The site is correctly marked
 to indicate the potential for sour gas even though the area is not 
generally known for sour gas production.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saskatchewan's Workers' 
Compensation Board and doctors who examined Crawford in Saskatchewan and
 Montreal have attributed his injuries directly to H2S. Medical 
diagnoses and opinions obtained by the Star reference H2S gas 16 times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with Crawford's 
physical ailments, psychological and neurological problems have emerged:
 PTSD, suicidal tendencies, anxiety and dizziness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crawford now lives with 
his parents in Montreal, unable to care for himself, living on workers' 
compensation benefits and spending his days in a sequence of medical 
appointments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I got divorced (from his
 common law partner) because of the eating and not sleeping properly. I 
sleep upright because if I fall asleep down I end up choking. I am here,
 but I'm here in a terrible way,” he says. “It was just too hard on her 
with the medical issues I was going through.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stunned and barely able 
to speak in the moments following the gassing on Feb. 9, 2014, Crawford,
 an industry veteran with nearly two decades of experience, stumbled to 
his truck and radioed for help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I tried to talk but my 
voice was messed up,” he says, his voice still raspy and broken. 
“Somebody came on and said, 'Are you OK? Are you OK?' I said, 'no, no.'”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then Crawford blacked out. He woke as he was being rushed to the small hospital in Unity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A note on his chart at 6:20 p.m. that evening reads: “Confirmed with boss at Northern Blizzard if any chemicals in oil — None.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After four intubation 
attempts, Crawford was put on life support and airlifted to Saskatoon. 
He regained consciousness two days later. Medical staff told him he had 
redlined three times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The doctors said it's a 
miracle for me to be here,” he says. “All everybody kept saying is they 
couldn't understand how I woke up from this.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crawford's initial 
diagnosis, detailed in his chart at Saskatoon Health Region, reads: 
“Post-inhalation injury of hydrogen sulphide,” which included symptoms 
of “loss of smell sense,” “difficulty swallowing and hoarseness.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Workers' Compensation
 Board accepted his injury claim a month later. A report from the WCB 
said Crawford was “struck in the face by a combination of crude oil, 
water and H2S gas,” which led to “difficulty breathing,” intubation, 
“inflammation of the throat area,” “lung collapse,” “swallowing and 
speech problems,” “olfactory paralysis” and “frequent severe headaches.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key factor in his diagnosis was H2S, a “toxic and irritating” substance that “affects basic metabolism.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The scarring documented 
of the palate/uvula area is almost certainly from the chemical burn he 
suffered from the H2S,” the report reads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The diagnosis came as no surprise to Crawford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I worked for quite a few
 oil companies and that was the only site I was ever nervous going 
into,” he says. “They said it was a sweet, not sour, field but every 
well we went into had HS2 marked on it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, industry and
 provincial Ministry of the Economy (ECON) officials were already 
dealing with complaints and concerns about H2S in southeast 
Saskatchewan, according to internal documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A 2012 
incident[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/10/01/that-rotten-stench-in-the-air-its-the-smell-of-deadly-gas-and-secrecy.html],
 in which a teenager was overcome by H2S in their driveway near Oxbow, 
Sask., triggered inspections of 11 oil and gas facilities. All failed 
with “serious infractions,” including releasing H2S at lethal levels 
“that may be exceeding 150,000 (parts per million),” according to an 
internal memo from December 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No fines or public 
warnings followed. No escalated enforcement, penalties or prosecutions 
followed. The problem continued. But Crawford and his other oilfield 
workers knew nothing about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are growing public
 concerns regarding the air quality issues in southeast Saskatchewan,” 
wrote an official with the industry's largest group, the <span class="companylink">Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP)</span>. “This has the potential to become a broader industry reputation/<b>social license</b> concern and warrants immediate attention by operators in the region.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a March 2013 letter, then-<b>energy</b>
 minister Tim McMillan — now president and CEO of CAPP — warned 
companies to meet “compliance obligations” or face “escalated 
enforcement, penalty and/or prosecution.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early 2014 — two 
months after Crawford's incident — government and industry officials met
 to discuss whether to make public ECON data showing H2S hot spots in 
the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“ECON believes current 
risk is significant,” read the minutes from the April 7, 2014 meeting. 
“Risk is highest for the workers, at the source … Are we creating a risk
 by not releasing this data immediately?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was never made public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May 2014, Michael Bunz
 died from H2S exposure from a broken valve on an oil tank near Carlyle,
 Sask. His employer is facing three charges under the province's 
occupational health and safety legislation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saskatchewan's 
regulations require that when workers are in situations that are 
“immediately dangerous” to life or health, employers and contractors 
“shall ensure that the worker is provided with and uses an approved 
atmosphere-supplying respirator” and that “a second worker, suitably 
equipped and trained, is present and in communication with the worker at
 all times.” The case remains before the courts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Bunz, Crawford was working alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There was nobody on 
site, which you're supposed to have,” he says. “After reading the story 
about Mr. Bunz, I just think this is so unnecessary … These oil 
companies keep doing the same thing and nothing changes. The government 
keeps letting them getting away with it. And I'm a forgotten person.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce Peachey, a petroleum engineering instructor at the <span class="companylink">University of Alberta</span>,
 says rules to warn workers about the potential presence of H2S and 
ensure two workers are present in dangerous situations are standard 
safety measures in the oilpatch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Aaron Thompson, 
program director for the occupational medicine at the University of 
Toronto, says that to lose consciousness, as Crawford did, signifies a 
“critical” incident that should have been reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That would seem to be a breakdown in reporting and a breakdown in the occupational health and safety system.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Provincial officials 
stated the province has increased inspections of wells and facilities 
that process high volumes of H2S, added inspectors and enforcement 
activities, erected air-monitoring stations and acquired highly 
sensitive hand-held measurement devices that allow inspectors to 
identify the source of sour gas odours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crawford says he filed complaints with <span class="companylink">Cona Resources</span> and the <span class="companylink">Mullen Group</span>,
 a transportation company that subcontracted to D.J. Heiland Trucking, 
but was never interviewed and never told of any investigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“All the safety guys came back and tried to blame the accident on me,” Crawford says of <span class="companylink">Mullen Group</span>, whose subsidiary, R.E. Line Trucking, is listed in some WCB documents as his employer. “I was in no shape to fight them.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Mullen Group</span> officials declined to be 
interviewed for this story. In a written statement, chairman and CEO 
Murray Mullen denied that company officials blamed Crawford. The 
statement confirms Crawford contacted the company's subsidiary, R.E. 
Line Trucking, two weeks after the incident and informed them he had 
“sustained a throat injury.” The statement says the subsidiary conducted
 an investigation along with Cona and D.J. Heiland Trucking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The statement does not detail that investigation, but says the area where the facility is located does not have H2S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This incident was not 
H2S related as you have alleged,” it reads. “We are not aware of any 
H2S-related incidents that would have required Saskatchewan 
(Occupational Health and Safety) reporting.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That conclusion contradicts Crawford's medical assessments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July 2014, a 
specialist in Montreal detailed Crawford's inability to swallow well, 
sleep apnea and speech problems “after his hydrogen sulphide exposure.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neurologist Michael Sidel concluded that Crawford suffered from “decreased taste and smell” as a result of exposure to H2S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sidel updated that 
assessment last year, stating Crawford suffers from “chronic dizziness, 
unsteadiness and decreased concentration. He has a permanent loss of 
smell and a functional change in his voice since the event. It is most 
probable that Mr. Crawford will not be able to return back to work on a 
permanent basis and his disability to some extent is likely permanent.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crawford's psychologist, 
Dr. Sydney Miller, wrote in 2015 that Crawford was suffering from 
serious PTSD following an injury involving the “inhalation and 
swallowing of hydrogen sulphide gas.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This past summer, 
Crawford says the Saskatchewan Workers Compensation Board threatened to 
stop his benefits and transition him back into the workforce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They were going to cut 
me off. After I said I spoke with (a Toronto Star journalist three weeks
 ago), now all of a sudden they're paying for everything again.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In principle, we are 
always working towards some form of return to work,” Phil Germain, 
vice-president of prevention at Saskatchewan WCB, said, not addressing 
Crawford's individual case. “That doesn't always happen. Sometimes it 
just can't happen. And that's fine. But we wouldn't be doing our job if 
we weren't trying.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sitting down for a meal, 
Crawford now goes through a ritual of liquefying his food and swallowing
 each mouthful slowly while pressing two fingers under his jaw to help 
it down with a slight gagging motion — among the many lingering effects 
of Feb. 9, 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I lost my house, I lost 
my truck, I lost everything I had. Thank God my parents are alive. If 
they weren't alive, I don't know where I'd be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was the healthiest guy
 in the world. I played hockey, I did sports, I hunted, I fished, I 
helped my dad with his renovation company, I worked, I had fun. Now, I 
don't do much.”</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian natural resources industry is undergoing enormous change. Volatile <b>energy</b>
 prices — the reality of US 55 per barrel — reduced production 
reliability, uncertain market access, the government’s climate change 
agenda, tightening environmental policy, safety, and compliance concerns
 along with increasing social drivers, such as <b>social license</b> to operate, all have resulted in industry upheaval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There seems to be a 
consensus that technological innovation is now more critical than ever 
to maintain the competitiveness of the oil and gas industry. According 
to Deloitte, “The industry is at a critical juncture where companies 
must go beyond merely acknowledging the need to innovate and start 
executing upon this imperative in a systematic way or else their 
long-term survival may be in jeopardy.”&nbsp;1</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At
 the same time, according to the Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance 
(COSIA), when speaking to Canada’s standing committee on natural 
resources, “While some technologies are already in or nearing 
commercialization, many, especially the more transformative ones, could 
take more than a decade to become available for deployment. There is 
about a 10-year time horizon from ideation to commercial deployment in 
the oil and gas sector.”&nbsp;2</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How does the industry 
pursue innovation to drive real business value realization, find more 
innovative ways to cut costs, increase revenues, create more productive 
solutions in exploration and development, and make better decisions on 
operational risk — all while accelerating the pace to commercial 
deployment?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For starters, we work 
together. It sounds like a cliché but when key players, producers, 
research and technology innovators come together, the opportunity to 
vastly accelerate common industry agendas is realized. The healthcare 
industry is a perfect example of such transformative innovation through 
shared agendas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transformative technology like AI, advanced algorithms, machine-learning and cloud systems — powered by the <span class="companylink">IBM</span>
 Watson platform — made its first impact in healthcare in 2012 starting 
with oncology — the study and treatment of cancer and tumors. Why 
healthcare? Two reasons: First, human health impacts us all, and second,
 the amount of data in the global healthcare industry is massive and AI 
systems like <span class="companylink">IBM</span> Watson are built for 
big data challenges. Medical journals, clinical studies, medical text 
books, x-ray and scanning film, and personal healthcare records are full
 of important data, and the healthcare industry shares a common agenda —
 to deliver the best possible care to patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With this in mind, key healthcare organizations and <span class="companylink">IBM</span>
 came together to build an oncology treatment advisor. Watson ingested 
millions of pieces of structured, unstructured and complex data — from 
both public and private sources — and dramatically changed the face of 
patient care. From there, <span class="companylink">IBM</span> Watson 
and other industries joined forces to accelerate the pace of advancing 
common industry challenges within the banking and insurance, 
manufacturing, retail, education and yes, the oil and gas and mining 
industries, to drive real innovation across the value chain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Secondly, when industry 
players work together on shared agendas, they also align current 
research, expertise and emergent technology solutions to existing 
challenges to accelerate immediate term profitability goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notice we’re focusing on 
immediate term? We all know that when economic climates constrain, the 
focus rapidly turns to short-term performance as uncertainty drives up 
risk in longer-term innovation and capital project commitments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-investment in shared 
industry programs delivers benefits almost impossible to reap as 
individual organizations, such as reduced project and development 
resources, reduced costs associated with common deployment environments,
 lower cost recovery thresholds and the benefit of higher reusability of
 program components and artifacts that reduces the need for redundant or
 new work efforts for each project initiation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirdly, when industry 
players come together to form common agendas, they can more broadly 
capitalize on technological innovation and research such as the Internet
 of Things (IoT) and connected operations, predictive analytics, 
blockchain, cloud and AI. To be an innovator, you need to take risk, and
 with risk comes increased liability and the possibility of failure. 
According to the <span class="companylink">World Economic Forum</span>, 
“the global oil and gas industry has at least 10 years to go before 
reaching a similar level of digital maturity to aerospace or 
automotive.”3</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The natural resources 
industry has access to a tremendous amount of valuable data, technology 
and research capabilities. They are very good at collecting data, and 
the growth in data management service providers in the oil and gas 
industry supports this data collection; However, in the last five to ten
 years the growth in computing power and advanced technologies to 
capitalize and draw insight, understanding and predictions from 
historical data, and public data sources, has not been fully realized. 
The oil and gas industry still struggles with turning data into 
actionable insights that drive faster, safer and more intelligent work. 
The evolution of the industry from outdated legacy systems — not capable
 of handling the data and computer processing power available today — to
 more powerful operational focusses enabled digital systems will take 
time, effort, capital and most of all, a significant cultural change in 
the way the industry works and operates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imperative to the 
industry is the evolution to a modern operational architecture that can 
ingest the “4 V’s” of data — volume, variety, velocity and veracity — 
from internal and external sources, then integrate that insight into 
enterprise processes and workflows for meaningful outcomes. The 
advancement of AI platforms focused in specific industry verticals over 
the last five years, enables computing systems and AI to focus on 
simplifying the intensive processes and complexity in data collection 
and information retrieval, and even predictions, allowing the geologists
 and engineers to make better judgment calls and actions based on their 
experience and the new insights AI brings to their data sets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strategic enablement of digital technologies in the oil and gas industry is now fundamental to its survival. At <span class="companylink">IBM</span>, we believe there is a place for shared agendas to advance innovation through digital transformation. We’ve just launched the <span class="companylink">IBM</span>
 Watson for Natural Resources Innovation program in the Canadian oil and
 gas industry. This 4-year, thirty million dollar value creation program
 will advance business transformation and focus on a collaborative

 —On Dec. 6, The Northern Miner sat down for an exclusive interview with
 Tom Butler, CEO of the U.K.-based International Council of Mining and 
Metals (ICMM), to discuss climate change politics, as well as other 
prominentchallenges and themes on the international stage heading into 
2018.Butler became CEO of ICMM in July 2015. Before that, he spent 18 
years with the <span class="companylink">World Bank</span>'s <span class="companylink">International Finance Corporation</span> in the infrastructure and natural resource teams, with much of that time focused on mining and power projects in Africa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Northern Miner: What are some thoughts on how the mining industry is perceived globally today?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Butler: There's a trust gap, and the question is: How do we close it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mining industry isn't doing well in many countries. You see that in the loss of <b>social license</b>
 where governments feel they have political room to take actions because
 the industry doesn't have the support of local populations. So there's a
 lot of work to be done when it comes to communicating the positive 
impacts of mining and getting local populations behind that message. 
That's especially true in developing countries where the industry can be
 a real agent of change when it comes to alleviating poverty and 
bringing resources into an economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, we hear
 a lot about climate change and the expectation that industry should do 
its part. I think the oil and gas industry has been hit harder by that 
message because there's an awareness that mining is going to supply the 
raw materials needed to "decarbonize" the world. And it's not just 
minerals like lithium and cobalt, but also resources like iron ore and 
metallurgical coal. We believe some of Canada's major companies are 
really emerging as leaders in the climate change discussion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: What are some of the challenges mining companies face on the international stage heading into 2018?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TB: There are really 
three key issues you hear a lot about right now. First, society is 
expecting the private sector to add a lot more value to stakeholders, 
and not just shareholders. So that means we need to deliver on 
sustainable development goals, address climate change and deal with 
inequality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, there's a lot of 
attention paid to resource scarcity in the broader sense, and that goes 
beyond scarcity of minerals. It includes things like water, air and 
human resources. That’s leading to growing pressure around issues like 
water management at mine sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Third, there are now 
expectations for much greater accountability and transparency. So that 
means citizens are getting much more involved in terms of where they put
 their money. They want to know about their investments, and there's 
much greater demand for environmental, social and governance criteria to
 be published and disclosed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: It can be difficult to quantify the near-term financial benefits vis-à-vis investments on things like green <b>energy</b> and “decarbonizing.” How does that impact the dynamic between stakeholders, shareholders and capital markets?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TB: We believe there's 
more alignment between shareholders and stakeholders than many people 
recognize. The companies realize that the major investors — including 
pension funds — are watching what's happening with these issues. I 
mentioned that growing realization in capital markets that people are 
very interested in where their money is being invested. A growing number
 of funds are using governance, environmental and social criteria in 
judging investments. Certainly climate footprint is an element investors
 consider when making decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we're talking about <b>social license</b>
 to operate, and delivering on citizen expectations, these are things 
that can create a number of issues in the final analysis. If you're on 
the wrong side of the reputation debate you run the risk of having 
people not wanting to invest, which could impact the share price. 
Ultimately, there's no value for shareholders in shutting down, or 
losing, a valuable project due to a lack of local support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: There’s also a 
segment out there that’s anti-development insomuch as it represents 
opposition to mining and natural resources, generally. How do you deal 
with messaging like, for example, Apple saying it intends to make 
iPhones out of completely recycled material to "stop mining the planet”?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TB: You can sit down at the table with everyone. I think that movement is still very much on the fringe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact is if we're 
going decarbonize economies and deliver the material society needs, 
particularly as people move into the middle class in places like China, 
there's going to have to be a huge amount of commodities supplied by the
 mining industry. You're not going to get that out of purely recycled 
material.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that really 
highlights the importance of communication and leveraging platforms like
 social media to really get our message out there. We need to continue 
to underline the role mining will play in supplying the technology 
sector. It’s important for society to understand that mineral extraction
 is really part of the solution to many of these challenges.</p>

 issues from lack of egress options to regulatory hurdles continue to 
dampen the competitiveness of Canada’s oil and gas sector and have 
contributed to increasing doubt among investors as to Canada’s 
attractiveness, say industry experts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Brian Schmidt, president and CEO of Tamarack Valley <b>Energy</b> Ltd. and a current board member of the <span class="companylink">Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP)</span>,
 said that in recent years the Canadian oilpatch has been delivered a 
series of “body blows” that have hindered the ability of companies to 
raise cash. Coupled with the impacts of the prolonged downturn, and it’s
 been tough sledding.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And
 Schmidt, who is chairman of CAPP’s Alberta Executive Policy Group, says
 current governments are doing little to help the situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think in other 
downturns we had help from governments that were interested in 
supporting our business. But we don’t have that right now. We’re pretty 
much on our own,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In fact, we’ve been 
dealt some significant body blows with pipeline issues, increased 
regulations, carbon tax, minimum wage—there are a lot of things that are
 working against the industry right now. And I think the [cancelation 
of] the <b>Energy</b> East pipeline was a very significant event that I 
don’t think we understand the total impact of. It was quite negative,” 
Schmidt added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So if you’re an investor
 and looking at several jurisdictions, Canada is not seen as a friendly 
jurisdiction to do business right now because of the complications we’ve
 had over the years. And that contrasts to other downturns where 
government and industry worked together to get some of these projects 
underway and did what it took to get it done. I’m not seeing that right 
now. I think the industry is on its own and you can expect more negative
 pressures here.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Leach, president of 
the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada (EPAC) agrees, saying 
the “unwelcoming business and investment climate that has developed in 
Canada in the last few years” has taken its toll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is a remarkable state
 of affairs for a country that relies heavily on the oil and gas 
industry to help balance its foreign trade, provide high paying jobs 
that supports equalization payments that flow from Alberta and 
Saskatchewan and contribute billions of dollars to federal and 
provincial coffers in royalties and taxes,” Leach said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It illustrates the 
inability of Canada’s political leadership at the federal and provincial
 levels to come together on what should be clear national interests: to 
make sure the nation’s non-renewable <b>energy</b> exports find markets 
at the highest world market price. It also illustrates the tremendously 
effective campaigns by industry opponents to influence politicians, 
policy and election outcomes in Canada.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Leach’s view, current government inaction and stance on some major <b>energy</b> projects runs counterintuitive to the nation’s best interests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I can’t think of another major <b>energy</b>
 producing nation, particularly among the world’s functioning 
democracies, with the potential Canada has to meet growing global 
demand, and yet has been so hobbled by its own governments in meeting 
that demand. Indeed, it’s no coincidence that a country like Canada with
 robust legal protection for the right to protest and with generous 
opportunities to intervene in the regulatory approval process, has 
attracted so much organized opposition,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s particularly 
disturbing when I think we can genuinely make the case there is no oil 
and gas industry in the world that has a better track record when it 
comes to responsible <b>energy</b> development. Even the head of the <span class="companylink">International <b>Energy</b> Agency</span>
 (Fatih Birol)in an October speech stated: ‘I wouldn't subscribe to the 
idea that we won't need oil anymore and a country like Canada, a 
reliable partner, a reliable producer, reliable exporter has a role to 
play in the global <b>energy</b> markets.’”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘Above ground issues’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Peter Tertzakian, executive director of ARC <b>Energy</b> Research 
Institute, said that while increased regulations are an issue, the 
challenges facing the oil and gas industry run much deeper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s broader than that. 
There’s the issue of Indigenous people and nimbyism—it’s just all 
wrapped up. It’s a very broad thing. I don’t want to be quoted as saying
 ‘it’s because of the government, or regulation or whatever.’ It’s far 
beyond that,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think it’s a large 
basket. I actually categorize it as ‘above ground issues.’&nbsp; The oil
 and gas industry has two dimensions. There’s the below ground issues of
 rock quality, the ability to get the stuff out of the ground, 
technology etcetera. So what’s happened is the below ground risks have 
diminished significantly over the last few years, but the above ground 
risks have been amplified,” Tertzakian added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And the above ground 
issues, all the way from local nimbyism to broad-based regulatory, to 
Indigenous issues and so on have increased. There’s no question that a 
lot of those above ground issues collectively are a drag on investment. 
It’s a very complex issue. I think we can agree that it’s the collective
 above ground dynamics that have hindered investment potential in 
Canada.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Duane Bratt, a political 
science professor at Calgary’s Mount Royal University, said the federal 
government’s decision to reorganize the <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board (NEB) </span>has added to the challenges facing Canada’s oil and gas industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I do think the reorganization and the changes to the <span class="companylink">NEB</span> are significant. I don’t believe they’re the sole reason, or possibly even the major reason for the <b>Energy</b>
 East cancellation—I think the numbers that some economists have put 
forward talk about increased capacity and those sorts of things—but the 
fiddling with the <span class="companylink">NEB</span> is a problem,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Even if it wasn’t a problem with <b>Energy</b>
 East, it will be in other ones for a number of reasons. I think one of 
them is just the whole idea of looking at upstream and downstream 
effects. That becomes very complicated.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, Bratt is of 
the belief that the overall attractiveness of Canada’s oilpatch to 
would-be investors remains relatively intact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I would think our 
reputation remains quite good. It’s a politically stable country. Yeah, 
[governments] have brought in emissions standards and carbon taxes, but 
those carbon taxes are consumer-wide, economy-wide,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They’re not just focused
 solely on producers. I think it’s really about a cost issue. We’re a 
more costly economy to invest in, but a safer place to invest.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Combating the challenges: What can the industry do better?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bratt said that oil and gas industry efforts to obtain <b>social license</b> for large-scale projects and other industry-related initiatives have often fallen short.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And what’s interesting about that is you hear critics of <b>social license</b>
 say it’s a [Prime Minister Justin] Trudeau term or an [Alberta Premier 
Rachel] Notley term, but it’s not. It actually came out of the Canadian 
mining industry and has now been applied to larger types of projects, 
including those in the oil and gas industry,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you were to read Jim Prentice’s book [Triple Crown: Winning Canada’s <b>Energy</b>
 Future] or Dennis McConaghy’s book [Dysfunction: Canada After Keystone 
XL], they’re quite critical of the things that industry has done. And 
[industry] needs to share some of the blame for some of these 
[unsuccessful] projects, as well,” Bratt added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The MRU professor added 
that the oil and gas industry has done a relatively poor job in 
successfully informing the general populace of its successes and 
operational and environmental improvements, of which there are many.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The thing is, a lot of 
the work that industry has been doing on emission reductions in the 
oilsands, for example, I don’t think have been particularly well known 
and they have trouble getting that message out because for years, 
executives, and some of the industry groups, were denying there was ever
 even a problem,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Meanwhile, their 
scientists were working on ways of dropping emissions. So there’s 
actually I think some good news stories with some of the research and 
development that’s been done.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Canadian oil 
and gas sector has done better in recent years in its attempts to get 
its message across, Tamarack Valley’s Schmidt says there’s still work to
 be done in leveling the playing field against well-funded and organized
 opponents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think we have to 
realize that there’s a lot of money—and I would say out of country 
money—that’s coming in to campaign against the hydrocarbon industry 
here. And I think we’ve been far too complacent as an industry of just 
kind of letting that happen and then letting things go unanswered,” he 
said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So I think we need to be getting our message out there in different ways and more effectively and consistently.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leach believes that the 
industry has begun to successfully, for the most part, respond in recent
 years to the “shifting targets” of protesters who oppose <b>energy</b> infrastructure projects and the sector as a whole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We all remember the 
negative publicity around hydraulic fracturing and the industry and 
regulators effectively responded with science-based regulations and best
 practices to tackle concerns about chemical use, water consumption and 
induced seismicity. The target of opponents then shifted to pipelines 
where Canadian oil and gas producers are uniquely vulnerable due to 
government policy failures to ensure infrastructure was built when 
needed,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Ultimately I think the 
necessary pipelines and facilities to accommodate Canadian production of
 bitumen, liquids and natural gas in the next couple of decades will be 
built, but unfortunately years late. For example, both the B.C. and 
federal governments are signaling they are motivated to ensure that 
another LNG project does not fail.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leach added that the “evolving position” of the Alberta government on <b>energy</b> and pipelines is “proof attitudes can change, especially when you want to get re-elected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And as the disastrous effects of Ontario’s green <b>energy</b>
 policies on that province’s competitive position become more apparent 
to voters, we should expect a similar shift among a sufficient number of
 Canadian voters to influence national policies too,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not(ley) enough?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier Notley has 
embarked on a cross-Canada travelling road show to highlight the 
benefits of vital pipeline infrastructure, including in Vancouver and 
Central Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Schmidt, though appreciative, said that effort, that provincial government support, should have happened sooner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think [Notley] is 
doing the right thing in advocating for pipelines and how important they
 are to Canada. I don’t think Canadians, in general, understand how 
significant these projects are and how it impacts our ability to pay for
 health care and education and some of the things we enjoy right now,” 
he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think there’s a 
serious disconnect between the public and these pipelines. So I applaud 
Premier Notley for getting out and getting the word out, and she’s 
obviously going against some of her colleagues’ policies. So I think 
it’s good. But I think it’s too little, too late.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schmidt also said the attempt of the Notley government to attain <b>social license</b>
 for pipelines and other infrastructure by invoking a carbon tax and 
other environmental-directed measures may have not been the best laid of
 plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think the idea of getting so-called <b>social license</b> by giving into the Green movement and carbon taxes and that sort of thing really hasn’t worked,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think a far better 
strategy would be to compare how clean and how regulated our industry 
is. We’re the most regulated jurisdiction in the world. And that, I 
think, is something we should be very proud of as Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So not allowing our oil 
and gas to get to world markets just means the dirtier stuff and the 
stuff with conflict is going to get produced. I think that’s a better 
argument than carbon taxes or shutting down coal plants, that sort of 
thing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not the end of days</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the many issues 
and challenges facing the sector, Tertzakian said the Canadian oil and 
gas industry still has a viable future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think there’s a 
tendency for some to think that the whole industry is shut down. That’s 
far from the truth. The reality is that the industry is producing and 
exporting more oil and gas than ever. Consumers are consuming more than 
ever. Investment in certain segments of the business is showing signs of
 improvement,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So in some ways, given 
all these above ground issues, it’s remarkable that the industry 
continues to operate as well as it does. I would caution, though, it’s 
not just because of these above ground issues. There’s disruptive 
changes happening in the world of capital markets—migration to ETFs, for
 example.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tertzakian said that some
 companies are adapting to the “new realities” better than others and 
those that stumble in the needed transition likely won’t fare well going
 forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The industry is going to
 look different, recognizing that these above ground issues are unlikely
 to relent anytime soon,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The narrative I believe 
is that this industry is going to be part of what I call ‘the suppliers 
of the future.’ Those companies that understand above ground and below 
ground, those are going to be the suppliers of the future—those that 
know how to manage and execute amidst the disruptions we’re seeing both 
above ground and below ground.”</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian natural resources industry is undergoing enormous change. Volatile <b>energy</b>
 prices — the reality of US 55 per barrel — reduced production 
reliability, uncertain market access, the government’s climate change 
agenda, tightening environmental policy, safety, and compliance concerns
 along with increasing social drivers, such as <b>social license</b> to operate, all have resulted in industry upheaval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There seems to be a 
consensus that technological innovation is now more critical than ever 
to maintain the competitiveness of the oil and gas industry. According 
to Deloitte, “The industry is at a critical juncture where companies 
must go beyond merely acknowledging the need to innovate and start 
executing upon this imperative in a systematic way or else their 
long-term survival may be in jeopardy.”&nbsp;1</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At
 the same time, according to the Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance 
(COSIA), when speaking to Canada’s standing committee on natural 
resources, “While some technologies are already in or nearing 
commercialization, many, especially the more transformative ones, could 
take more than a decade to become available for deployment. There is 
about a 10-year time horizon from ideation to commercial deployment in 
the oil and gas sector.”&nbsp;2</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How does the industry 
pursue innovation to drive real business value realization, find more 
innovative ways to cut costs, increase revenues, create more productive 
solutions in exploration and development, and make better decisions on 
operational risk — all while accelerating the pace to commercial 
deployment?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For starters, we work 
together. It sounds like a cliché but when key players, producers, 
research and technology innovators come together, the opportunity to 
vastly accelerate common industry agendas is realized. The healthcare 
industry is a perfect example of such transformative innovation through 
shared agendas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transformative technology like AI, advanced algorithms, machine-learning and cloud systems — powered by the <span class="companylink">IBM</span>
 Watson platform — made its first impact in healthcare in 2012 starting 
with oncology — the study and treatment of cancer and tumors. Why 
healthcare? Two reasons: First, human health impacts us all, and second,
 the amount of data in the global healthcare industry is massive and AI 
systems like <span class="companylink">IBM</span> Watson are built for 
big data challenges. Medical journals, clinical studies, medical text 
books, x-ray and scanning film, and personal healthcare records are full
 of important data, and the healthcare industry shares a common agenda —
 to deliver the best possible care to patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With this in mind, key healthcare organizations and <span class="companylink">IBM</span>
 came together to build an oncology treatment advisor. Watson ingested 
millions of pieces of structured, unstructured and complex data — from 
both public and private sources — and dramatically changed the face of 
patient care. From there, <span class="companylink">IBM</span> Watson 
and other industries joined forces to accelerate the pace of advancing 
common industry challenges within the banking and insurance, 
manufacturing, retail, education and yes, the oil and gas and mining 
industries, to drive real innovation across the value chain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Secondly, when industry 
players work together on shared agendas, they also align current 
research, expertise and emergent technology solutions to existing 
challenges to accelerate immediate term profitability goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notice we’re focusing on 
immediate term? We all know that when economic climates constrain, the 
focus rapidly turns to short-term performance as uncertainty drives up 
risk in longer-term innovation and capital project commitments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-investment in shared 
industry programs delivers benefits almost impossible to reap as 
individual organizations, such as reduced project and development 
resources, reduced costs associated with common deployment environments,
 lower cost recovery thresholds and the benefit of higher reusability of
 program components and artifacts that reduces the need for redundant or
 new work efforts for each project initiation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirdly, when industry 
players come together to form common agendas, they can more broadly 
capitalize on technological innovation and research such as the Internet
 of Things (IoT) and connected operations, predictive analytics, 
blockchain, cloud and AI. To be an innovator, you need to take risk, and
 with risk comes increased liability and the possibility of failure. 
According to the <span class="companylink">World Economic Forum</span>, 
“the global oil and gas industry has at least 10 years to go before 
reaching a similar level of digital maturity to aerospace or 
automotive.”3</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The natural resources 
industry has access to a tremendous amount of valuable data, technology 
and research capabilities. They are very good at collecting data, and 
the growth in data management service providers in the oil and gas 
industry supports this data collection; However, in the last five to ten
 years the growth in computing power and advanced technologies to 
capitalize and draw insight, understanding and predictions from 
historical data, and public data sources, has not been fully realized. 
The oil and gas industry still struggles with turning data into 
actionable insights that drive faster, safer and more intelligent work. 
The evolution of the industry from outdated legacy systems — not capable
 of handling the data and computer processing power available today — to
 more powerful operational focusses enabled digital systems will take 
time, effort, capital and most of all, a significant cultural change in 
the way the industry works and operates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imperative to the 
industry is the evolution to a modern operational architecture that can 
ingest the “4 V’s” of data — volume, variety, velocity and veracity — 
from internal and external sources, then integrate that insight into 
enterprise processes and workflows for meaningful outcomes. The 
advancement of AI platforms focused in specific industry verticals over 
the last five years, enables computing systems and AI to focus on 
simplifying the intensive processes and complexity in data collection 
and information retrieval, and even predictions, allowing the geologists
 and engineers to make better judgment calls and actions based on their 
experience and the new insights AI brings to their data sets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strategic enablement of digital technologies in the oil and gas industry is now fundamental to its survival. At <span class="companylink">IBM</span>, we believe there is a place for shared agendas to advance innovation through digital transformation. We’ve just launched the <span class="companylink">IBM</span>
 Watson for Natural Resources Innovation program in the Canadian oil and

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DON MARTIN: All right. 
It's time for the long-awaited words of wisdom from the wild and 
wonderful, the national press gallery. I'll let you decide who's wild 
and who's wonderful. Stephanie Levitz is with the <span class="companylink">Canadian Press</span>, you're wonderful; Craig Oliver, the wild man, <span class="companylink">CTV</span>'s political commentator. I do want to bring in some breaking news because a regulatory authority on the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline has just come out with a ruling that basically lets <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 start construction over the objections of the town of Burnaby where it 
will end up as a terminal for this. It looks, Stephanie, like a green 
light for <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> now. Is the headache over for Justin Trudeau? Or John Horgan might have other plans here.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STEPHANIE LEVITZ (<span class="companylink">Canadian Press</span>):
 Yeah. I mean the issue here of course was that the federal government 
had approved this, right, in the city of Burnaby just to catch people 
up. The city of Burnaby was opposing it, and sort of in line with some 
of the politics right now in British Columbia. And so for the folks to 
step in and say, look, the federal government, the constitution says the
 feds own this one, it belongs to them, get going on it, is definitely a
 significant win for the Liberal government, but it doesn't solve the 
problem, the broader problem of <b>social license</b>, right, for the 
pipeline itself. If the city of Burnaby remains opposed, if the province
 of British Columbia remains opposed, it becomes still a political 
problem for the governing Liberals no matter what a court might say 
otherwise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CRAIG OLIVER (<span class="companylink">CTV</span>
 News): There's still an appeal in the federal court of course by six 
First Nations, and a couple of environmental groups, and the city of 
Burnaby and Vancouver who are challenging the whole thing on the basis 
that the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> did not 
adequately get enough consent from First Nations. And that's what killed
 one of the northern pipelines, that issue. In this case, though, my 
friend here is saying the federal government has already approved this 
and so has the <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span>. So the city of Burnaby had been throwing all kinds of roadblocks in the way by refusing permitting, and the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> went to the NEP and said, look, national <b>energy</b>
 program, and said we need to stop this, we're being tainted by the fact
 the opposition, the provincial government, and so many others, you have
 to deal with this because you approved this, and so did Ottawa approve 
it. And so today that one roadblock is gone, but there's still many 
others to go, but this was a big one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Okay. Let's move 
on because we'll just have to wait and see on that one. I do want to ask
 you about free trade. I mean we had John Manley on. He sounds a little 
pessimistic that we're not getting all our eggs in the basket that we 
need to get into to deal with the fact <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> might be going down the toilet. Craig, are we seeing the failure of our ability to negotiate free trades around the world?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: Well one has to 
observe that the incident in Beijing, in which the prime minister, 
everything seemed to fall apart. The prime minister went into that 
meeting expecting that he was going to be signing an agreement to launch
 a free trade negotiation, and it all came apart. The Chinese basically 
rejected the prime minister wanting to bring his domestic agenda to bear
 on a free trade deal, his progressive agenda involving women's rights, 
gender, labour, maybe the whole issue of whether Canada could depend on a
 decision in the courts there if there is a dispute between partners, 
all of that. And the Chinese said, no, what they want is strictly a 
business deal, and that's all they want. In fact they're beginning to 
sound like the Americans in the sense that they're saying take it or 
leave it. And the other issue here, which is similar, is that when we're
 dealing with the Americans, there's an asymmetrical relationship. They 
are powerful. We're not. And it's the same thing with China. They're 
saying you want to deal with us, you're going to have to get it our way.
 So this is the second time the prime minister has left the meeting in 
tatters, as he did in Vietnam in the case of the Trans-Pacific 
Partnership. And the Japanese are blaming Trudeau for the fact that that
 came apart when they were ready to make a deal. So one should worry, I 
think, about the state of our trade negotiations if everywhere you look 
three of them now are not going well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: I don't know, do fools rush in on these things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEVITZ: Well I was going 
to play devil's advocate on this a bit, because there's something 
interesting to be said about what the prime minister talked about in 
China when he was talking about trade as a driver of populism, right. 
And he talked about the issue with trade deals being that the ones 
historically have left people really falling behind, and governments 
have not done a good enough job putting in place trade deals and then 
subsequent other agreements, training programs, skills development, that
 compensate for the industries that end up getting hit negatively by 
trade deals. And so if the issue here for Mr. Trudeau and the Liberal 
government is truly to ensure trade agreements that actually benefit 
everyone, that, you know, bring the benefits of globalization home to 
everybody, then it's a question of him not being able to land those kind
 of trade deals. And is that really a bad thing? It's a fair question to
 ask, right. If <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> killed the textiles industry, is it fair to launch another trade deal that's going to kill off another industry?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: Yeah. Certainly 
one of the major drivers of populism in the world, and certainly in the 
case of Trump and the Republicans, was trade deals they said were bad 
for them. But who's going to say that we should not have a trade deal 
with China, especially when we don't know where the Americans are going,
 and the Chinese right now are feeling that they are now the centre of a
 new world order. They believe that you're going to have to trade with 
them whether you like it or not, and this is the way it's got to be. 
That's the way the Americans are acting also. I don't know how we can 
say we're not coming back, China, to consider this, and I think I agree 
with you, the way the prime minister wants to go, many Canadians support
 it. But do they support it at the loss of a trade and investment deal 
worth who knows how many jobs and how many billions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEVITZ: Part of it, too, 
is the narrative right. Like you have to wonder that the Trudeau 
Liberals have not lost control of the narrative on trade deals. To go 
into China and say we're going to walk out with a trade deal, that's a 
little aggressive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: And how could 
they have communicated that so many times and it failed so dismally? 
What went wrong? Again, the prime minister is not even going to explain 
what went wrong. MARTIN: I've got to move on. I do want to move on. The 
Supreme Court Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin made her farewell 
appearance in the court today. She was presiding over a case of free the
 beer, not an interesting way to go out. So she leaves the bench after 
28 years, and she had some parting words. Let's just hear what she had 
to say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEVERLY MCLACHLIN (<span class="companylink">Supreme Court</span>
 Justice): That brings me to thanking the Canadian public who are always
 behind us. We expect criticism. We often get it. And that's good in a 
democracy. Our decisions are there and open for comment and criticism. 
But what I have always felt is that the Canadian public generally 
supports its justice system and supports this court. And for that I am 
enormously grateful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Craig Oliver, great Albertan, might I say. Craig, what do you think is her legacy? Is there one?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: I think she has 
brought more social justice, humanity, she has opened up that court in a
 way it had never been opened up before to discussion, to some 
explanation of the kind of decisions they were making. She's just been 
one of the great chiefs of that court. And she was a woman, first woman 
in that job. She was an example long before many people thought that 
women were there, she was there, so she's greatly admired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Steph, I know you've covered a lot of court cases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEVITZ: I have, yeah.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: What have you observed about this chief justice?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEVITZ: Well you know 
it's interesting you say free the beer is an interesting case to go out 
on. I actually think it's one, it's a perfectly case for Beverley 
McLachlin, because in this sense she has opened up the court as Craig 
said, she's really tried to give access to justice for all Canadians, to
 give it its due, modernize the court, give more access to journalists, 
more access to the common citizen. So she's going out on a case that is 
really about opening the borders of provincial trade, opening the 
borders of boundaries, and giving Canadians access to beer. It's just 
sort of fitting, and I do, it's sort of fitting in her legacy. And she's
 a true trailblazer and Canada's own sort of Ruth Bader Ginsberg you 
know, and I hope that she continues speaking out publicly once she 
retires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Yeah. Well she's 
going to write a fictional book, apparently she's already got a 
publisher and the publisher has paid her a lot of dough, so I look 
forward to seeing that, because I agree with you, every time I've been 
over there watching her, she just brings an air of dignity to it. She'll
 be sadly missed. All right, I think she's doing a news conference next 
week so we'll bring that to you as well. Thank you both. Have a good 
weekend. We'll talk to you soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEVITZ: Nice to be here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Coming up, my "Last Word" on someone talking themselves out of cabinet. Please stay with us.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Webber, author and mechanical engineering professor at the University of Texas at Austin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Source: <span class="companylink">University of Texas at Austin</span>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineering professor Michael Webber is deputy director of the University of Texas at Austin's <b>Energy</b> Institute, where one of specialties is researching the intersection of <b>energy</b>
 infrastructure engineering and policy. S&amp;P Global Market 
Intelligence talked with Webber about the challenges natural gas 
pipelines face in the current political, regulatory and market 
environment, as well as potential remedies for the industry. The 
following is an edited transcript of the conversation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S&amp;P Global Market 
Intelligence: There have been some recent decisions stalling or, in some
 instances, even overturning pipeline project approvals. Is this a sign 
that courts are becoming more sympathetic to pipeline opponents, or 
instead are pipeline opponents' arguments becoming more sophisticated?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Webber: I don't 
think courts have changed their outlooks, necessarily. I do think the 
opponents have become more sophisticated in two ways. One, I think their
 coalitions are a little more diverse, so it's not just the 
environmental groups. They often bring in land-rights groups, and so 
they get a little more of an ideological spread that way. The other 
thing is they focus more of their effort on midstream rather than 
production sites. For a long time, opponents to oil and gas would focus 
on production to stop the extraction. Then they found over time that 
stopping the midstream is easier and it has the same effect because if 
you can't move gas to market, then you wouldn't produce in the first 
place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second piece to this 
is as time goes on, accidents happen. Every single accident of a 
pipeline, every spill or leak or problem, becomes part of the collection
 of evidence against pipelines. Time is on the side of the opponents. 
The more time goes on, the more accidents will happen, and that's used 
as part of the case to stop the construction of new pipes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think all projects are 
seeing the same kind of thing, which is more legal action at the 
midstream level, and more groups are brought to the table for that legal
 action. Every leak that happens just damns the case. The more leaks 
that happen, especially if it's the same company or pipeline or region, 
makes it that much harder to get approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is there anything developers can do to counter this momentum that opponents seem to have?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not sure what the 
best strategy is, but I think there are advantages if pipeline 
developers explain the relative safety of pipes versus trains. An 
alternative to moving by pipe is to move oil by train, for example, and 
trains have their own safety record that's problematic. They could talk 
about the comparative safety and cleanliness of the pipe versus the 
train.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other thing they 
could talk about is the comparative safety of piped gas than coal, for 
example, because there's less pollution from gas and [fewer] people will
 die from respiratory infection. They've got the argument that pipelines
 actually offer an environmental advantage, compared to rail or coal. I 
think you'll start to see that kind of thing happen more and more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What do midstream companies need to focus on in order to maintain their <b>social license</b>? Is that at risk in a post-Dakota Access and post-Keystone XL U.S.? If it is, how big of a risk factor are we talking about?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think it is a risk. The
 midstream sector needs to do a better job developing stakeholder groups
 they can communicate well with and explain the broader argument of why 
it's beneficial to have pipelines. It's ultimately something pipeline 
companies have done a bad job on, that sort of social engagement, and 
that's how they get opposition. It could be life or death for a certain 
pipeline, not necessarily to the companies, but if they can't get a <b>social license</b>, they can't get a permit, they can't build or operate the pipeline. Absolutely, it's a high-stakes situation for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking out to 2018, 
what's the one area you think pipeline companies should focus on to 
ensure that a project will be successful?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pipelines tend to be at 
their best when they are first built. Brand-new materials degrade over 
time because the soils shift or because of corrosion of the pipelines. 
The problem with pipelines is not year one, but maybe year 20, year 40 
in its lifetime. One way to deal with that is to build in a fund that 
accumulates money so when the money is needed to improve or replace a 
pipeline, the money is available. It's easier to do that early on before
 you need it than to wait until you need it to do it. I feel like that 
should be part of what's going on with pipelines is built-in funding for
 when inevitably a problem occurs, to avoid that problem and then to 
mitigate that problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is there anything else you want to mention that we have not covered?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The infrastructure of midstream, in general, is an important part of <b>energy</b>, not just for oil and gas and pipelines. Moving <b>energy</b> around is a difficult task and is required for all forms of <b>energy</b>.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian natural resources industry is undergoing enormous change. Volatile <b>energy</b>
 prices — the reality of US 55 per barrel — reduced production 
reliability, uncertain market access, the government’s climate change 
agenda, tightening environmental policy, safety, and compliance concerns
 along with increasing social drivers, such as <b>social license</b> to operate, all have resulted in industry upheaval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There seems to be a 
consensus that technological innovation is now more critical than ever 
to maintain the competitiveness of the oil and gas industry. According 
to Deloitte, “The industry is at a critical juncture where companies 
must go beyond merely acknowledging the need to innovate and start 
executing upon this imperative in a systematic way or else their 
long-term survival may be in jeopardy.”1</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At
 the same time, according to the Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance 
(COSIA), when speaking to Canada’s standing committee on natural 
resources, “While some technologies are already in or nearing 
commercialization, many, especially the more transformative ones, could 
take more than a decade to become available for deployment. There is 
about a 10-year time horizon from ideation to commercial deployment in 
the oil and gas sector.”&nbsp;2</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How does the industry 
pursue innovation to drive real business value realization, find more 
innovative ways to cut costs, increase revenues, create more productive 
solutions in exploration and development, and make better decisions on 
operational risk — all while accelerating the pace to commercial 
deployment?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For starters, we work 
together. It sounds like a cliché but when key players, producers, 
research and technology innovators come together, the opportunity to 
vastly accelerate common industry agendas is realized. The healthcare 
industry is a perfect example of such transformative innovation through 
shared agendas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transformative technology like AI, advanced algorithms, machine-learning and cloud systems — powered by the <span class="companylink">IBM</span>
 Watson platform — made its first impact in healthcare in 2012 starting 
with oncology — the study and treatment of cancer and tumors. Why 
healthcare? Two reasons: First, human health impacts us all, and second,
 the amount of data in the global healthcare industry is massive and AI 
systems like <span class="companylink">IBM</span> Watson are built for 
big data challenges. Medical journals, clinical studies, medical text 
books, x-ray and scanning film, and personal healthcare records are full
 of important data, and the healthcare industry shares a common agenda —
 to deliver the best possible care to patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With this in mind, key healthcare organizations and <span class="companylink">IBM</span>
 came together to build an oncology treatment advisor. Watson ingested 
millions of pieces of structured, unstructured and complex data — from 
both public and private sources — and dramatically changed the face of 
patient care. From there, <span class="companylink">IBM</span> Watson 
and other industries joined forces to accelerate the pace of advancing 
common industry challenges within the banking and insurance, 
manufacturing, retail, education and yes, the oil and gas and mining 
industries, to drive real innovation across the value chain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Secondly, when industry 
players work together on shared agendas, they also align current 
research, expertise and emergent technology solutions to existing 
challenges to accelerate immediate term profitability goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notice we’re focusing on 
immediate term? We all know that when economic climates constrain, the 
focus rapidly turns to short-term performance as uncertainty drives up 
risk in longer-term innovation and capital project commitments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-investment in shared 
industry programs delivers benefits almost impossible to reap as 
individual organizations, such as reduced project and development 
resources, reduced costs associated with common deployment environments,
 lower cost recovery thresholds and the benefit of higher reusability of
 program components and artifacts that reduces the need for redundant or
 new work efforts for each project initiation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirdly, when industry 
players come together to form common agendas, they can more broadly 
capitalize on technological innovation and research such as the Internet
 of Things (IoT) and connected operations, predictive analytics, 
blockchain, cloud and AI. To be an innovator, you need to take risk, and
 with risk comes increased liability and the possibility of failure. 
According to the <span class="companylink">World Economic Forum</span>, 
“the global oil and gas industry has at least 10 years to go before 
reaching a similar level of digital maturity to aerospace or 
automotive.”3</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The natural resources 
industry has access to a tremendous amount of valuable data, technology 
and research capabilities. They are very good at collecting data, and 
the growth in data management service providers in the oil and gas 
industry supports this data collection; However, in the last five to ten
 years the growth in computing power and advanced technologies to 
capitalize and draw insight, understanding and predictions from 
historical data, and public data sources, has not been fully realized. 
The oil and gas industry still struggles with turning data into 
actionable insights that drive faster, safer and more intelligent work. 
The evolution of the industry from outdated legacy systems — not capable
 of handling the data and computer processing power available today — to
 more powerful operational focusses enabled digital systems will take 
time, effort, capital and most of all, a significant cultural change in 
the way the industry works and operates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imperative to the 
industry is the evolution to a modern operational architecture that can 
ingest the “4 V’s” of data — volume, variety, velocity and veracity — 
from internal and external sources, then integrate that insight into 
enterprise processes and workflows for meaningful outcomes. The 
advancement of AI platforms focused in specific industry verticals over 
the last five years, enables computing systems and AI to focus on 
simplifying the intensive processes and complexity in data collection 
and information retrieval, and even predictions, allowing the geologists
 and engineers to make better judgment calls and actions based on their 
experience and the new insights AI brings to their data sets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strategic enablement of digital technologies in the oil and gas industry is now fundamental to its survival. At <span class="companylink">IBM</span>, we believe there is a place for shared agendas to advance innovation through digital transformation. We’ve just launched the <span class="companylink">IBM</span>
 Watson for Natural Resources Innovation program in the Canadian oil and
 gas industry. This 4-year, thirty million dollar value creation program
 will advance business transformation and focus on a collaborative 
approach to reduce time-to-market and drive technology ROI.</p>

 an NDP Alberta premier is touring the country - or at least a few 
select cities - touting the benefits of pipelines that take Albertan oil
 to market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Justin 
Trudeau has borrowed Rachel Notley's logic, framing his environmental 
policies as a way to smooth over pipeline approvals and win "<b>social license</b>" for the emissions-intense bitumen shipped from the oil sands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Canadians start to 
feel the pinch from newly-introduced carbon taxes, the pipelines - and 
the jobs they bring - take on an increased importance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's where the major pipeline projects stand as we push into the second half of both Notley and Trudeau's first term in power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keystone XL</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you didn't see any 
touchdown celebrations after Nebraska approved the $8 billion Keystone 
XL pipeline this week, that's because it came with some major caveats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may also be because 
everyone involved in the Keystone pipeline is pretty jaded after former 
U.S. President Barack Obama delayed the project in 2011, before finally 
killing it in 2015. It was revitalized this year by Donald Trump, but 
there's still major hurdles to clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The approval from 
Nebraska requires a new route, which will cause all kinds of 
construction and legal complications in that state and possibly a whole 
new review(

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in any event, some

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Justin 
Trudeau speaks with pipeline protestors as they stand and hold signs at a
 town hall at the University of Winnipeg in Winnipeg, Thursday, January 
26, 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trans Mountain</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trans Mountain 
pipeline is one of the few bright lights on the pipeline front. Not only
 has it cleared regulatory hurdles, but it also takes Alberta oil to the
 west coast, which will get a better price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> has already started site preparations and terminal construction and expects to begin pipeline construction in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's not to say its

Notley spent this week campaigning across Canada(

Pipeline protests in the United States and wonder if something similar 
could happen in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Edmonton Journal 
columnist Graham Thomson wrote on Thursday, "Notley needs construction 
of the project to begin in 2018 to have a fighting chance in the 2019 
provincial election."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau's problem isn't 
existential like Notley's, but not getting Trans Mountain built, after 
vetoing the Northern Gateway pipeline and seeing <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> kill <b>Energy</b> East will still come with a political price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Line 3 Replacement</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid the frenzied 
celebrations from politicians(

 ) in Alberta for the Trans Mountain approval, Enbridge's Line 3 
expansion pipeline got a little shortchanged on fanfare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Trans Mountain 
is more likely to get name-checked, the Alberta NDP constantly 
references the "two pipeline approvals" won on their watch, with the 
second one being Line 3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pipeline was approved
 last year - at the same time as Trans Mountain - and is a $8.2 billion 
project, with $5.3 billion worth of it happening in Canada. The pipeline
 runs from Hardisty, AB to Wisconsin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan is to replace 
the existing Line 3 with a new pipeline, improving safety and boosting 
capacity, which perhaps explains why it flew under the radar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite that, Enbridge is
 still bickering with Minnesota about final approval of the deal. A 
ruling in December( 
http://www.ctvnews.ca/business/enbridge-says-line-3-project-progressing-despite-rising-scrutiny-in-minnesota-1.3660206[http://www.ctvnews.ca/business/enbridge-says-line-3-project-progressing-despite-rising-scrutiny-in-minnesota-1.3660206]
 ) from that state will decide if the project goes ahead as planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Energy</b> East and Northern Gateway</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These two pipelines are dead, although recriminations over why are still flying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northern Gateway ran into
 trouble, in part, because the courts believed the government hadn't 
adequately consulted with First Nations about the project. Alongside the
 decision to approve Line 3 and Trans Mountain, Trudeau also pulled the 
plug on Northern Gateway, saying it didn't serve the best interests of 
the affected communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Energy</b> East was killed by <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>
 itself, and some blamed the burdensome regulatory environment for the 
company's decision. Others blamed the economics of the pipeline( 
http://business.financialpost.com/opinion/terence-corcoran-economic-reality-killed-the-<b>energy</b>-east-pipe-dream-and-thats-good[http://business.financialpost.com/opinion/terence-corcoran-economic-reality-killed-the-energy-east-pipe-dream-and-thats-good]
 ), which required oil to be at a price that may not be realistic 
anymore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a common thread 
running through all the new pipeline projects in Canada. With oil prices
 stagnating, competing shale oil showing no signs of slowing down and 
carbon pricing soon to be a reality across the country, the cost benefit
 analysis of every pipeline is changing for the worse.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian natural resources industry is undergoing enormous change. Volatile <b>energy</b>
 prices — the reality of US 55 per barrel — reduced production 
reliability, uncertain market access, the government’s climate change 
agenda, tightening environmental policy, safety, and compliance concerns
 along with increasing social drivers, such as <b>social license</b> to operate, all have resulted in industry upheaval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There seems to be a 
consensus that technological innovation is now more critical than ever 
to maintain the competitiveness of the oil and gas industry. According 
to Deloitte, “The industry is at a critical juncture where companies 
must go beyond merely acknowledging the need to innovate and start 
executing upon this imperative in a systematic way or else their 
long-term survival may be in jeopardy.”&nbsp;1</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At
 the same time, according to the Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance 
(COSIA), when speaking to Canada’s standing committee on natural 
resources, “While some technologies are already in or nearing 
commercialization, many, especially the more transformative ones, could 
take more than a decade to become available for deployment. There is 
about a 10-year time horizon from ideation to commercial deployment in 
the oil and gas sector.”&nbsp;2</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How does the industry 
pursue innovation to drive real business value realization, find more 
innovative ways to cut costs, increase revenues, create more productive 
solutions in exploration and development, and make better decisions on 
operational risk — all while accelerating the pace to commercial 
deployment?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For starters, we work 
together. It sounds like a cliché but when key players, producers, 
research and technology innovators come together, the opportunity to 
vastly accelerate common industry agendas is realized. The healthcare 
industry is a perfect example of such transformative innovation through 
shared agendas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transformative technology like AI, advanced algorithms, machine-learning and cloud systems — powered by the <span class="companylink">IBM</span>
 Watson platform — made its first impact in healthcare in 2012 starting 
with oncology — the study and treatment of cancer and tumors. Why 
healthcare? Two reasons: First, human health impacts us all, and second,
 the amount of data in the global healthcare industry is massive and AI 
systems like <span class="companylink">IBM</span> Watson are built for 
big data challenges. Medical journals, clinical studies, medical text 
books, x-ray and scanning film, and personal healthcare records are full
 of important data, and the healthcare industry shares a common agenda —
 to deliver the best possible care to patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With this in mind, key healthcare organizations and <span class="companylink">IBM</span>
 came together to build an oncology treatment advisor. Watson ingested 
millions of pieces of structured, unstructured and complex data — from 
both public and private sources — and dramatically changed the face of 
patient care. From there, <span class="companylink">IBM</span> Watson 
and other industries joined forces to accelerate the pace of advancing 
common industry challenges within the banking and insurance, 
manufacturing, retail, education and yes, the oil and gas and mining 
industries, to drive real innovation across the value chain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Secondly, when industry 
players work together on shared agendas, they also align current 
research, expertise and emergent technology solutions to existing 
challenges to accelerate immediate term profitability goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notice we’re focusing on 
immediate term? We all know that when economic climates constrain, the 
focus rapidly turns to short-term performance as uncertainty drives up 
risk in longer-term innovation and capital project commitments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-investment in shared 
industry programs delivers benefits almost impossible to reap as 
individual organizations, such as reduced project and development 
resources, reduced costs associated with common deployment environments,
 lower cost recovery thresholds and the benefit of higher reusability of
 program components and artifacts that reduces the need for redundant or
 new work efforts for each project initiation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirdly, when industry 
players come together to form common agendas, they can more broadly 
capitalize on technological innovation and research such as the Internet
 of Things (IoT) and connected operations, predictive analytics, 
blockchain, cloud and AI. To be an innovator, you need to take risk, and
 with risk comes increased liability and the possibility of failure. 
According to the <span class="companylink">World Economic Forum</span>, 
“the global oil and gas industry has at least 10 years to go before 
reaching a similar level of digital maturity to aerospace or 
automotive.”3</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The natural resources 
industry has access to a tremendous amount of valuable data, technology 
and research capabilities. They are very good at collecting data, and 
the growth in data management service providers in the oil and gas 
industry supports this data collection; However, in the last five to ten
 years the growth in computing power and advanced technologies to 
capitalize and draw insight, understanding and predictions from 
historical data, and public data sources, has not been fully realized. 
The oil and gas industry still struggles with turning data into 
actionable insights that drive faster, safer and more intelligent work. 
The evolution of the industry from outdated legacy systems — not capable
 of handling the data and computer processing power available today — to
 more powerful operational focusses enabled digital systems will take 
time, effort, capital and most of all, a significant cultural change in 
the way the industry works and operates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imperative to the 
industry is the evolution to a modern operational architecture that can 
ingest the “4 V’s” of data — volume, variety, velocity and veracity — 
from internal and external sources, then integrate that insight into 
enterprise processes and workflows for meaningful outcomes. The 
advancement of AI platforms focused in specific industry verticals over 
the last five years, enables computing systems and AI to focus on 
simplifying the intensive processes and complexity in data collection 
and information retrieval, and even predictions, allowing the geologists
 and engineers to make better judgment calls and actions based on their 
experience and the new insights AI brings to their data sets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strategic enablement of digital technologies in the oil and gas industry is now fundamental to its survival. At <span class="companylink">IBM</span>, we believe there is a place for shared agendas to advance innovation through digital transformation. We’ve just launched the <span class="companylink">IBM</span>

Tony Clement today was saying, look, we got the same information. It 
wasn't ready. So, you know, I think the Liberals do have to take some 
responsibility for that decision, but then more importantly, what we 
need to measure now is how quickly the Liberals are fixing this problem 
because it's, it's not, it's, you know, they're talking about 
whole-of-government approach. It's a whole-of-government mess, like 
everybody's not being paid. And, you know, I don't think that's a 
positive thing.</p>

that's been said today is, how is this going to get fixed? How am I

to hold the government to account to, and where the government needs to 
quickly go is saying this is how we're fixing it, rather than, you know,
 trying to diffuse blame, because we have to go forward. On the CRA 
thing, I just want to echo what Nathan said. You know, a lot of times 
the case work that we get in any of our offices are, are people who are 
having difficulties with CRA because they've gotten wrong information.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: We're going into a bit of a circle. I want to get Michelle expertise on this, because you're the immigration critic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: Yes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: What did you make
 of the refugee settlement thing? It sounds to me like the auditor 
general is saying the services, the money wasn't there to provide the 
services in the right location when they were needed for these Syrian 
refugees. What was your read?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: That's exactly 
right. Essentially, the report said what we've been saying all along, is
 that the emphasis was placed so much on, you know, the arrivals of the 
refugee rather than the hard work of providing integration services on 
the back end. The report confirms that we found in a parliamentary study
 that showed people were not getting access, timely access to language 
training services. The government isn't measuring basic things like 
whether or not children are able to attend school. So the, the report 
really exposed a flaw in the government's ability to provide integration
 support for refugees. And this is so off brand for the government, 
right? So for me, you know, I hope that this is, the report is a wake-up
 call for the government that, you know, these, these photo-op policies 
aren't good enough in terms of instilling confidence in the public to 
support <b>social license</b> for immigration, and that these are 
people. They're not numbers. And we have to be providing these services 
to them so that they have a successful experience here in Canada. It was
 a disappointing report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Nathan?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CULLEN: As complicated 
and hard as it is to get a large number of refugees out of war-torn 
areas, and get them to Canada, the actual even larger work is making 
sure they're successful when they get here. The government spent a great
 deal of time and <b>energy</b> and there was some photo-op aspect to 
this of welcoming this many refugees to town, to Canada without the plan
 in place to support them. That's what the auditor general told us. I 
think Michelle's point is well taken that if we want broad support for 
refugees to be able to come to Canada, immigration in general, Canadians
 need to see the program as successful for those people and those 
families as they come into Canada, rather than unsuccessful, which we've
 seen in Europe and other places. So, more than a wake-up call, this is 
a, a serious thing, longer-term beyond even just these families who are 
impacted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Yeah, we've got to get them integrated successfully, or else this is going to be non-stop...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: Yeah. But, you
 know, there are so many great stories out there, and what they call 
photo-op, very cynically, is actually an example to the world. And we 
have mobilized, the federal government has...</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: ...enormous 
resources, enormous resources to welcome this number of refugees to 
Canada. Things have gone very well. Things have happened very quickly. 
And the entire government was involved. Canadians should be very proud 
of how we are leading the way.</p>

been able to access one-on-one counselling support. So, it's like, the

Donald Trump may have saved Rachel Notley's political hide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Admittedly, an NDP win remains a real long shot in the 2019 election.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But
 for the NDP to have any shot, at least one major pipeline has to be 
under construction by the time the election is called in the spring of 
2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot else has to be going right, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price of oil has to 
continue its climb from where it is now (in the $55US range) to around 
$70US. The NDP have to reduce spending and begin to get their deficit 
under control. And tens of thousands of <b>energy</b>-sector workers have to be back working again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, if the Alberta 
economy is humming when the election is called two years from now, there
 is an extremely narrow path to victory for the New Democrats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Keystone XL (KXL) 
is the pipeline most likely to be under construction by 2019, Notley and
 the NPD owe their tiny sliver of hope to the U.S. president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, it was Trump 
who agreed to give federal permits to the $8-billion pipeline project 
back in March. That reversed seven years of stalling and, finally, 
outright rejection by the Obama administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, technically, it was Monday's approval by the <span class="companylink">Nebraska Public Service Commission</span>
 that removed the last official hurdle to Keystone XL. But without 
Trump's approval first, the Nebraskans wouldn't even have made a 
decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot can still go wrong. <span class="companylink">TransCanada Corp</span>.
 might decide not to go ahead with the 1,800-km extension of their 
existing Keystone line that would connect Alberta's oilsands with a 
pipeline hub in Cushing, Oklahoma.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> cancelled the <b>Energy</b>
 East pipeline in October, it did so mostly because of environmental 
hurdles erected by Justin Trudeau's federal Liberal government. But to 
the extent that decision was economic, Keystone might prove to be 
equally uneconomic..</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American courts might 
also side with environmentalists or Nebraska ranchers and issue 
injunctions against construction. Or protestors might block construction
 for weeks or months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, Keystone is far from a done deal just yet, although it remains the most likely major pipeline to actually get built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be a shame 
though if Keystone helped Notley get re-elected. At the very best, her 
attitude towards the project has been lukewarm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our premier has held many
 positions on Keystone, but she has probably been opposed or indifferent
 more than she has been in favour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Notley and the NDP were in opposition before the May 2015 election, they were clearly against the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then during the campaign 
they sent mixed messages. Candidate Rachel Notley told the Edmonton 
Sun's editorial board she was in favour of Keystone. Later she told the 
CBC's Evan Solomon "we're against it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly after being sworn
 in as premier in May 2015, her federal NDP brethren came out staunchly 
against Keystone during the federal election. Notley refused to 
repudiate their stance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Barack Obama 
announced he was blocking Keystone in November 2015 - the same month the
 New Dems came out with their carbon tax and climate leadership plan - 
Notley refused to go to Washington to complain. She made it clear she'd 
rather Keystone didn't go ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the last U.S. 
presidential race, when Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton declared 
herself against Keystone, Notley said she and Clinton were on the same 
page.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Trump was elected in November 2016, Notley refused once again to go to D.C. to lobby for Keystone saying it "was not key."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, I suppose, because her "<b>social license</b>"
 strategy has failed so miserably to get a single Canadian pipeline 
built, maybe that's why Notley has suddenly become such a big booster of
 Keystone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Donald Trump has become Rachel Notley's last, best chance of a second term.</p>

 - In an ornate ballroom in one of downtown Calgary's few Edwardian

Tuesday to hash out one of the questions festering at the heart of 
Alberta's politics: What really happened to <b>Energy</b> East?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>
 pipeline was intended to be a win-win project: Alberta would gain 
access to tidewater for its beleaguered bitumen; oil would travel to a 
refinery on Canada's east coast; resources would stay in the country.

and darkening the province's increasingly sour mood.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter to the <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span>
 explaining its decision, the company cited "delays resulting from the 
regulatory process," among other obstacles. Andrew Leach, a professor of
 <b>energy</b> policy at the University of Alberta and one of the 
architects of Alberta's climate change policy, was among the loudest 
voices crying foul over <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s implication. Canning <b>Energy</b>
 East was a reasonable business decision inspired by low oil prices, 
reduced oilsands production forecasts and the imminent approval of 
Keystone XL, Leach had argued publicly in the wake of the announcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, Leach gathered with Dennis McConaghy, <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s
 former executive vice-president of corporate development, and Martha 
Hall Findlay, president of the Canada West Foundation and once a Liberal
 MP for a Toronto riding, to hash the matter out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leach contended that <b>Energy</b>
 East's fate was clear once Trump was elected. Oil prices are low, 
production predictions have been slashed, and once Keystone XL was back 
on the table, the less-efficient <b>Energy</b> East was doomed. "It was the most expensive of the pipeline projects, so the one you naturally take off the deck," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <b>Energy</b> East panel, left to right: Andrew Leach, Dennis McConaghy and Martha Hall Findlay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McConaghy took issue with that position. <b>Energy</b>
 East already had shipping contracts lined up, he said, and while 
Alberta might indeed maintain adequate pipeline supply if both Keystone 
XL and the TransMountain pipeline are approved, the fate of those two 
projects is still uncertain. (Keystone XL is still awaiting sign-off 
from Nebraska's state government, while TransMountain must face an 
interprovincial intransigence so entrenched that Alberta premier Rachel 
Notley plans to go on a cross-country road trip to support the project.)
 <b>Energy</b> East would have been a viable third option, and oil 
companies were willing to pay the price of potentially having too much 
capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The real tragedy of losing <b>Energy</b> East was that a set of circumstances evolved to reach a point where <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>
 couldn't just suspend the project, but went on to terminate it, and 
that was fundamentally driven by a conviction they could never get the 
permit," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The regulatory process 
has simply become so unpredictable that no sane company will throw 
billions of dollars behind a project that can be cancelled on a 
political whim, just as Northern Gateway was, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is total 
uncertainty in this country about whether we can get anything built," 
Hall Findlay said, adding that among resource companies Canada was 
beginning to acquire the reputation for political uncertainty of a 
banana republic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no political 
clarity around what this country wants or what it will approve, she 
added. The approvals process is now taking decades, in hopes of creating
 a <b>social license</b> that will never be granted by staunch 
anti-oilsands activists. The cost of that delay for business can reach 
hundreds of millions of dollars per month.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McConaghy said that if 
the government wants to impose an even-handed carbon strategy, well, 
fine. Just make that clear upfront and apply it to all industries 
equally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not like these 
points haven't been made to the Trudeau government," he said. The 
government heard all these gripes and then "dismissed all the actual 
problems and instead advocated for more open-ended engagement, as if the
 regulatory process were a focus group as opposed to a technocratic 
exercise."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the eyes of both Hall Findlay and McConaghy, nothing exemplified this more than <b>Energy</b> East. After the regulatory process had begun, the <span class="companylink">NEB</span>
 said that it would take into consideration greenhouse gas emissions 
from the oilsands and the oil burned after it left the line rather than 
just the emissions of the actual pipeline. This was untenable, they 
argued, the sort of standard that would never be applied to central 
Canadian industries. It would be like judging the approval of an auto 
plant based on the lifetime emissions of all the cars it produced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The final straw was moving the goalposts," Hall Findlay said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Establish what the 
strategy is and then let our regulatory bodies implement those 
directions. But let them do their jobs. If every decision then comes 
back to what is a political win, we will not get anything done."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> executives announce the company's <b>Energy</b> East Pipeline project on Aug. 1, 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there was no doubt in Hall Findlay's mind that the cancellation of <b>Energy</b> East was celebrated in the Prime Minister's office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When that announcement 
was made, there were champagne bottles popping in Ottawa," she said. As 
the Liberals face more competition from the NDP, the pipeline "would 
have been a major, major headache for the federal Liberals."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite this, both Hall 
Findlay and Leach warned about the increasingly vicious rhetoric 
currently being bandied about across provincial lines: UCP leader Jason 
Kenney has said he would scrap Alberta's carbon tax and cut permits to 
oil pipelines feeding B.C. if it continues to stall the TransMountain 
expansion. Those threats only add to the culture of political 
uncertainty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But McConaghy nonetheless echoed the darker sentiment now rippling through much of the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think it's naive to 
think that in a scenario where Keystone XL doesn't happen because of 
Nebraska and TransMountain (falters) because the federal government 
didn't enforce (its regulatory approval, the idea that Alberta is going 
to be saying 'We stepped up. We applied the most stringent carbon tax in
 the country and you stiffed us on market access,'" he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"No one should think the political reaction to that isn't going to be extreme."</p>

 pipeline expansion in British Columbia faces a fresh challenge, Premier
 Rachel Notley will speak to business crowds in three provinces in an 
attempt to build support for the controversial project considered 
critical for Alberta's <b>energy</b> sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley said in an 
interview Sunday she will bring her sales pitch to Toronto, Ottawa, 
Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver later this month in the hopes of 
convincing more Canadians the Trans Mountain expansion project is in the
 country's best interest.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We
 are a very small economic player internationally, and we punch well 
above our weight, but we're not going to be able to do that if we become
 paralyzed by very parochial decision-making," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The oil and gas industry
 continues to contribute significantly to national economic growth... To
 walk away from it is negligent. It's economically negligent."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s project, already faced 
with legal challenges, has been met with new resistance in Burnaby, 
B.C., where the municipal government has not issued permits to allow for
 the $7.4-billion pipeline expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arguing Burnaby is intentionally delaying construction, the company has asked the <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span>
 to intervene and allow for work to begin. That city counters it is 
following its process for reviewing similar development applications and
 rejects the idea it is dragging its feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta will throw its support behind <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> before the <span class="companylink">NEB</span>, which may review the case through written submissions or a short hearing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While United Conservative
 Party Leader Jason Kenney has publicly mused about potential economic 
retaliation against B.C., if that province is successful in blocking or 
stalling <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s project, Notley said she's not interested in "irresponsible sabre-rattling."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're going to make the 
case in a reasonable and responsible way as long as the matter is still 
alive, which it is," the premier said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley, who begins her 
tour Nov. 20 at the Empire Club of Canada in Toronto, may be preaching 
to the converted as she appears before pro-development business crowds 
across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she speaks at the 
Greater Vancouver Board of Trade Nov. 30, her audience will likely be 
sympathetic, but it will give her a platform to reach other British 
Columbians who can be swayed, as she attracts local media attention, 
said George Hoberg, a professor at the University of British Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I suspect her goal is to
 reach the political middle in B.C., to make the best case to those who 
are not in the camp of active, adamant opponents," Hoberg said in email 
exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That audience is 
critical to how responsive the (B.C.) NDP government is likely to be to 
pipeline opponents. It will also be very important in the dynamics of 
protest and police response that will occur, should construction ramp 
up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hoberg, who teaches 
environmental and natural resource policy, also warned that "First 
Nation and environmental opponents to the pipeline will do their best to
 greet Notley and make sure their message continues to get attention as 
well."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley said her 
government - which has attempted to secure support for pipelines by 
imposing a climate change agenda that includes a carbon tax and cap on 
oilsands emissions - has "reasonable levels of credibility" among 
Canadians who are concerned about the environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are people who still can have their mind changed, and it's important to get the facts out there," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prasad Panda, <b>energy</b>
 critic for the United Conservative Party, supports Notley's move but 
argues she should have invited him and other opposition MLAs to join her
 in a united front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Panda said he believes 
Notley genuinely backs the oil and gas industry, but he questioned her 
decision making, having appointed environmentalists Tzeporah Berman and 
Karen Mahon to an oilsands advisory panel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were among several 
panelists who were excused in June, not because of their beliefs, but 
because the group's focus had shifted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both activists have 
openly opposed the Trans Mountain pipeline. Mahon was recently arrested 
after she and three other protestors took to kayaks and roped themselves
 to a barge near <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s marine terminal in Burnaby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For the last two years, 
(Notley) was living in a fool's paradise thinking that by imposing a 
carbon tax and by imposing the cap on oilsands development, she would 
get <b>social license</b>, but that is not the case," Panda said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kinder Morgan chief 
executive Steve Kean recently warned that delays in securing permits and
 regulatory approvals could put the project nine months behind schedule,
 though the company is exploring measures to speed things up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has also 
warned that every month of delay from its planned December 2019 
in-service date would directly cost as much as $35 million, and another 
$90 million a month in lost revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The B.C. government has vowed to use any means at its disposal to stop the project, which would twin <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s
 existing line, more than tripling its capacity and getting more Alberta
 crude to tidewater for export. It also faces legal challenges by 
environmentalists, Indigenous communities and B.C. municipalities.</p>

payments made related to the commodity derivatives during 2017 YTD, 
partially offset by cash proceeds of $17.2 million on the sale of

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Production of 64,668

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Revenue of $389.1 million generated primarily from the sale of 65,341 tonnes of copper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Production and Additional Highlights for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pinto Valley Mine:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Produced 14,381 tonnes 
of copper during Q3 2017 at a C1 cash cost1 of $2.06 per pound of 
payable copper produced and all-in cost1 of $2.37 per pound of payable 
copper produced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Produced 41,171 tonnes 
of copper during 2017 YTD at a C1 cash cost1 of $2.01 per pound of 
payable copper produced and all-in cost1 of $2.40 per pound of payable 
copper produced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*At Pinto Valley, 
production was below expectations during Q3 2017 due to mill 
disruptions. As a result, C1 cash cost1 and all-in cost1 per payable 
pound of copper produced for Q2 2017 were higher than planned. 
Additionally, focus in the quarter shifted from throughput maximization 
to overall mill optimization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cozamin 
Mine:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Produced 4,242 tonnes of
 copper during Q3 2017 at a C1 cash cost1 of $1.10 per pound of payable 
copper produced and all-in cost1 of $1.86 per pound of payable copper 
produced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Produced 12,478 tonnes 
of copper during 2017 YTD at a C1 cash cost1 of $1.21 per pound of 
payable copper produced and all-in cost1 of $1.84 per pound of payable 
copper produced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Copper production at 
Cozamin exceeded expectations, driven primarily by higher throughput. 
Mine development continues to advance ahead of schedule, increasing 
production flexibility at the operation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*During Q3 2017, Capstone entered into an agreement with <span class="companylink">Endeavour Silver Corp</span>.
 ("Endeavour Silver") which allows for the two companies to exchange 
access to certain of each other's mining concessions that abut at the 
southern boundary of Capstone's Cozamin mine property and for the 
sharing of information on the various concessions covered by the 
agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Drill results released 
during the quarter indicated the continuation of the Mala Noche Footwall
 Zone ("MNFWZ") along strike to the southeast. Copper grades in excess 
of 4% were encountered in a 580 metre step-out hole to the southeast 
from the limits of the current MNFWZ Indicated Mineral Resource 
immediately adjacent to the Endeavour Silver's claims over larger than 
average widths than typical of the MNFWZ. Cozamin's 2017 exploration 
budget has been increased by a total of $1.1 million to accelerate 
testing of the MNFWZ on both sides of the Capstone/Endeavour Silver 
boundary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Minto Mine:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Produced 3,403 tonnes of
 copper during Q3 2017 at a C1 cash cost1 of $2.87 per pound of payable 
copper produced and all-in cost1 of $3.01 per payable pound of copper 
produced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Produced 13,328 tonnes 
of copper during 2017 YTD at a C1 cash cost1 of $2.22 per pound of 
payable copper produced and an all-in cost1 of $2.28 per payable pound 
of copper produced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*At Minto, production for
 the quarter was impacted by mine sequencing changes to support the mine
 life extension. Underground mining was disrupted to upgrade the 
emergency response capacity in the current stoping areas while 
development to the Minto East deposit continued. Partially oxidized ore 
from the Area 2, Stage 3 open pit and low grade stockpiles supplemented 
the mill feed during the quarter to offset the resulting underground ore
 shortfall, causing lower head grade and recoveries than originally 
planned. The shortfall in production resulted in higher unit costs 
during Q3 2017 than planned and as a result a $1.6 million impairment 
was recorded against the carrying value of Minto's concentrate inventory
 during Q3 2017. $7.2 million of underground ramp development costs in 
2017 YTD were expensed because they were incurred before the mine life 
extension decision was made. This equates to an increase to Minto's C1 
cash costs1 of $0.25 per payable pound produced YTD. In addition, 
because it is expected to take less than 12 months to mine the planned 
open pit deposits in 2017, all stripping costs in 2017 are being 
expensed and not capitalized, also impacting C1 cash costs1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Based on improved copper
 prices and updates to Minto's mine plan, Management has made the 
decision to bring previously written off resources into the mine plan. 
This will extend the life of the mine and increase its value. As a 
result, an impairment reversal of $20.6 million was recorded during Q3 
2017. Key assumptions included copper price assumptions ranging from 
$2.93/lb. - $3/lb. ($3/lb. long term) and an 8% discount rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additional highlights:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Subsequent to period 
end, Capstone repaid $14.0 million on the senior secured corporate 
revolving credit facility ("RCF"), reducing drawn debt to $284.9 million
 as at October 18, 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outlook</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Production Guidance:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capstone expects to reach
 the low end of the range of 2017 consolidated production guidance of 
94,000 tonnes (±5%) of copper.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operating Cost Guidance:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was no change to the cost guidance at Pinto Valley and Cozamin during the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Minto, 2017 production
 is expected to be lower and costs higher than guided due to mine 
sequencing changes to support a mine life extension to 2021 and delays 
in reaching underground ore. Additional stripping costs and underground 
development costs are being incurred to bring additional deposits into 
the mine plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Primarily as a result of 
higher C1 cash costs1 and all-in costs1 at Minto, and also increased 
share-based compensation expenses resulting from improvements in the 
Company's share price in 2017 and lower production expected at Pinto 
Valley, consolidated C1 cash costs1 , all-in costs1 and fully-loaded 
all-in costs are expected to be higher than previously guided.</p>

requirements of Canadian securities laws, which differ from the 
requirements of US securities laws. Without limiting the foregoing, this
 news release may refer to technical reports that use the terms 
"indicated" and "inferred" resources. US investors are cautioned that, 
while such terms are recognized and required by Canadian securities 
laws, the SEC does not recognize them. Under US standards, 
mineralization may not be classified as a "reserve" unless the 
determination has been made that the mineralization could be 
economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve 
determination is made. US investors are cautioned not to assume that all

have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to 
whether they can be mined legally or economically. It cannot be assumed 
that all or any part of "inferred resources" will ever be upgraded to a 
higher category. Therefore, US investors are also cautioned not to 
assume that all or any part of inferred resources exist, or that they 
can be mined legally&nbsp;or economically. Accordingly, information

 Premier Rachel Notley wants to continue to dismiss opposition to 
pipelines by her federal and British Columbia NDP counterparts, she 
should lobby to make the Alberta party a distinct identity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike parties such as 
the Liberals, the New Democrats are integrated at the provincial and 
federal levels. So when Albertans sign up to support Notley and her 
colleagues, they automatically become members of the federal NDP. That's
 why it's strange to hear Notley say federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh's 
hostility toward pipelines is of no consequence.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm
 not going to get too wrapped up in what people who are not in 
government are doing in other parts of the country, in hypothetical 
conversations, over which they have no agency," Notley said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certainly, it's true that as the leader of the third largest party in <span class="companylink">Parliament</span>, Singh isn't in a position to give a green light or red light to <b>energy</b>
 projects, but the optics are terrible. Notley's federal leader is going
 around the country whipping up opposition to projects her government 
says are not only in Alberta's interest, but in the national interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More jarringly, her 
British Columbia NDP cousin, Premier John Horgan, has pledged to use 
every tool at his disposal to block the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline expansion, which was approved by the federal government and his predecessor, Christy Clark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not uncommon to have
 disagreements within families, but surely Notley must realize it's 
untenable to have her colleagues working against her in such bold 
fashion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Singh was in Vancouver on Friday, where he said he has three criteria that must be met for any <b>energy</b>
 projects to be approved - that Indigenous rights are respected, that 
Canada can meet its climate change goals if the pipeline goes ahead, and
 that the projects prioritize local jobs. Neither Trans Mountain nor the
 now-shelved <b>Energy</b> East projects met those criteria, said Singh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the federal leader praised Notley for her government's initiatives directed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It needs to be pointed 
out, Premier Notley has the most aggressive and comprehensive climate 
change policy in Canada. We won't achieve our climate goals if we don't 
have a premier like Rachel Notley in Alberta," said Singh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ah, that would be the same climate change plan that was supposed to earn so-called <b>social license</b> for pipelines - support that hasn't been forthcoming from Singh and Horgan and their sort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Alberta's NDP party has different views than its federal counterpart, it should take steps to separate the two organizations.</p>

 3 is unlikely to be required reading among the political strategists 
and general hangers-about charged with plotting a repeat victory for our
 current provincial government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a pity, as they 
might learn something, because indeed for every thing there is a season,
 and a time for every purpose under heaven.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And
 right now, it's becoming glaringly obvious the ongoing, two-year-long 
strategy of borrowing a fortune while hoping Alberta's economy does one 
of those bust-to-boom routines is wearing thin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in the springtime, 
there was a little jaunt in the step of the treasurer when he spoke of 
green shoots, followed by a glint in the premier's eye as she waxed 
lyrical about turning some corner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, six months on and 
halfway through this dismal financial year, that jaunt is morphing into a
 limp and the corner looks as though it leads to Dead End Street. Nope, 
things are not rebounding the way the government undoubtedly expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just like our current 
backyards, those green shoots are gone and a season of reckoning is upon
 us. Thoughts of sure-fire, rapid growth are now only for the foolish or
 criminally optimistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which, in political 
terms, means this government's strategy is hitting a brick wall 
comprised of stubbornly high unemployment and dangerously worrisome 
levels of borrowing. Halfway through their mandate and Notley's crew are
 running out of time, because if things don't change soon, they are done
 like the proverbial dinner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month is already proving a nightmare. First came news <span class="companylink">TransCanada Corp</span>. is pulling out of the <b>Energy</b>
 East pipeline project after facing so much criticism, political 
grandstanding and shifting regulatory sands they probably breathed a 
huge sigh of relief despite the disappointment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was no relief in Edmonton, however. This was a body blow to the government's much-ballyhooed <b>social license</b>
 strategy, in which we all get whacked with a carbon tax with the 
explicit promise this would make the rest of Canada all warm and cuddly 
toward Alberta pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nope, that longed-for 
love-in didn't get too far. So now all eyes, and a heck of a lot of 
votes, are tied to measurable progress of the westward-ho pipeline 
project, otherwise known as the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain expansion, a
 project that the government across whose territory it must proceed is 
intent on delaying and ultimately ditching. Yes, our prime minister is 
on board, but remind me again how many federal seats the Grits hold here
 in Alberta?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As if that wasn't bad enough, we had the latest woes our monthly labour statistics provide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news is 
unemployment fell to 7.9 per cent, but delve just slightly below the 
surface and that appears like that old joke about the man who's just 
lost a leg getting a decent offer on his slippers. The reason it went 
down is the labour force fell - at this rate, we'll have nobody out of a
 job because everyone's quit looking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of people 
working in September actually fell by 7,800. Now perish the thought the 
looming minimum wage hike could have had anything to do with that - but 
the fact is the biggest drop came in accommodation and food service 
employment, where many such low-paid jobs reside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No doubt the close to 
8,000 jobs in that sector that vanished in the month prior to the 
mandated pay hike would just be statistical noise to Labour Minister 
Christina Gray. In her cosy world, the metadata is already counted and 
there'll be no turning back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's symptomatic of the
 bigger problem. Other than hoping oil prices suddenly ratchet skyward, 
there's no other plan to reduce our enormous borrowing binge, as any 
suggestion of trimming spending is greeted with shrieks of brutality and
 heartlessness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except time is running 
out and hope isn't a strategy. So now, in the second half of her 
mandate, Premier Rachel Notley needs to rethink this government's 
policies, because, as in Ecclesiastes 3, there is a time to keep and a 
time to cast away.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DON MARTIN: Welcome back.
 Our Thursday MP combo of diverse political opinion joins us to talk 
pipelines, plaques, and a phoenix which refuses to rise. Ruby Sahota is a
 Liberal MP from Brampton, Michelle Rempel a Conservative MP from 
Calgary, and the pride of Essex, NDP MP Tracey Ramsey. Welcome to you 
all. Michelle, you heard Jim Carr. Tell me what's the view of Calgary on
 this. What's your reaction, <b>Energy</b> East I'm talking about?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MICHELLE REMPEL (Conservative – Alberta): You know, if the Liberals wanted to completely shut down the <b>energy</b>
 sector, I wish we would have just had that policy discussion, or the 
courage to have that policy discussion in parliament. The reality is 
between the carbon tax, which is not going to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions, between even the small business tax issue this week, the 
changing of the rules for major <b>energy</b> projects which require a 
large capital investment, certainly the downstream emission review on 
this, like, come on, we're not reviewing Saudi oil for that. The tanker 
moratorium that, they actually shut down debate on the tanker moratorium
 bill after only two opposition speakers this week. I could go on and 
on. The reality is all of these things combined is an ideological 
opposition to the <b>energy</b> sector. You heard Jim Carr talk about 
the pipelines that they approved. Well, we approved four pipelines under
 our government. So that's fact. The other component is that the 
government, they refuse to stand up and acknowledge that many First 
Nations communities actually want some of these pipelines to be 
produced. We already have one of the world's strongest regulatory 
systems in the world, and I wish that they would have just had the 
courage to call it national <b>energy</b> program the second, but they 
were smart enough not to. The unfortunate thing is I think that this is 
going to stoke western alienation. I think that this is going to hurt 
the entire economy writ large, and their talking points are very, very 
weak and they're not cognizant of the reality that the <b>energy</b> sector plays in the Canadian economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Okay. It is an engine of growth out there. Tracey, where is the NDP coming down on <b>Energy</b>
 East? Is this a business decision or political obstruction? TRACEY 
RAMSEY (NDP – Ontario): Well this isn't a surprise because the system is
 broken that we're using. The process that we're using is broken. We've 
been saying that for a very long time. You have to include <b>social license</b>.
 You have to include the communities that are impacted. And here we saw 
the municipalities saying that they didn't want this, having the 
province weigh in. Like when you have people in a community who are 
objecting to what you're doing, then you have to take a serious look at 
that. Until they fix this process, don, you know, no project really is 
going to go through in the way that it should. It's not going to have 
every single aspect looked at, and know that that project is good for 
Canada. We're happy to see this happen. Obviously this is something that
 we were calling for. But it's not a surprise, and it's just another 
example of how the government needs to listen to the people in the 
communities that are impacted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: So, Ruby, I'm sure you want to weigh in somewhere between those two polar opposites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RUBY SAHOTA (Liberal – 
Ontario): Absolutely. Government has been listening, and therefore 
that's why we have a process that has been working and takes into 
account what Indigenous people are saying. It takes into account the 
issue with the emissions. And we have successfully, under this exact 
same process, the process has not changed regardless of what the 
Conservatives want to sell to people, the process is the same and we've 
approved three pipelines since that time. Two oil pipelines, <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>,
 Line 3, a gas pipeline, Nova Gas, and that's created over 25,000 jobs. 
How many jobs did the Conservatives create in that area? Zero! Because 
you did not, the fact is you did not...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: Whoa, whoa, Ruby, come to Calgary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAHOTA: ...any oil pipelines in ten years. We've approved three.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: Keystone, Anchor 
Loop, the Line Nine reversal. Wrong, wrong, wrong, and the reality is 
that there's over 200,000 people that are out of work in Alberta. So 
anybody in Alberta that's talking about jobs created under the Trudeau 
government are actually going to be throwing tomatoes at their screen 
right now. That is such complete malarkey. And I just wish, again, I 
mean we're going to continue to stand up for the <b>energy</b> sector, 
but I think what everybody is going to be doing today is looking at the 
Trudeau government and saying, look, why didn't you just have the 
courage to stand up and say we don't want this to happen. Why just try 
and trick Canadians into thinking anything otherwise?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAHOTA: We absolutely wanted it to happen. It was a business decision at the end of the day made by <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: But why isn't Canada open for business on this? If it's a business... SAHOTA: We're absolutely open to business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: No, what you've 
done is you've, you have changed the rules on a billion dollar capital 
decision. You have changed the rules on the taxation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: You have changed rules and the context and labour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Go ahead Tracey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RAMSEY: This is an 
example of how broken the process was under the previous Conservative 
government. It continues to be under the Liberals. And until this 
process gets fixed, it has to get fixed. This is broken. We saw the 
social licence today coming to play, communities coming into play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: What exactly is broken about this?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RAMSEY: Listening to 
communities. You have to take into account the communities that this is 
traveling through, not just where it's coming and where it's going 
through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: I got to move on. We're running out of time and I want to get to this issue because the "<span class="companylink">New York Times</span>", the "<span class="companylink">Washington Post</span>", the "Times of Israel", the "<span class="companylink">BBC</span>"
 are all covering the story of the missing mention on our brand new 
national holocaust memorial down there. There's no mention of the Jewish
 population that was exterminated in the gas chambers. All we've got in 
place is that millions of men, women, and children were murdered during 
the holocaust, and the survivors who persevered were able to make their 
way to Canada after one of the darkest chapters in history. The plaque 
didn't mention anything about Jews. It has since been removed. The 
government, like what's your reaction to this?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RAMSEY: This is a very 
serious oversight. You know this, we're glad that it's down, but this is
 a very serious oversight that's hurtful to people who are in Canada who
 are descendants of people who are Jewish who faced anti-Semitism. There
 needs to be an acknowledgment of what exactly happened there, and it 
can't be this kind of just vague reference to the amount of people that 
were murdered in the holocaust, so it needs to be fixed. It's just a 
very unfortunate and really a big mistake by the Liberals not catching 
that this should have been an important piece.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: How can you not 
proofread a plaque, or did they just decide they couldn't single out one
 set of victims and decide just to lump it in as men, women and 
children. What did you think when you heard this?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: I guess two 
points. First to that, you know, if you go to any holocaust memorial 
around the world, be it Yad Vashem, or the American holocaust memorial, 
the communities that built those take great pains to talk about the 
Roma, or Jehovah's Witnesses, or members of the LGBTQ community that 
were also included, but the reality is I think a key component of 
anti-Semitism to this day is people who purport that the Jewish 
community somehow made the holocaust up. And the main way that we can 
fight anti-Semitism is by strongly pushing back, and saying unless we 
recognize how many members of the Jewish community were killed simply 
because of their faith under extreme conditions, the saying never again 
won't actually happen. So, you know, this is a pretty big oversight, and
 one that I'm glad was corrected. But I mean, yes, proofreading a plaque
 should have happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: And a bit of a 
global, I mean laughing stock is the wrong word, but certainly we're 
being held up to ridicule around the globe for this. I mean surely 
someone, who should be held responsible for this, Ruby?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAHOTA: I don't disagree 
with anything my colleagues have said. It is a time in our history that 
needs to be acknowledged, and we need to learn from it. We need to call 
it what it was, and, you know, over six million Jews died, so there was 
no excuse. We really appreciate that (inaudible) flagged the issue right
 away and immediately it was removed. On the monument overall, there are
 over 50 mentions of the Jewish people, but this plaque in particular 
had that oversight, and I don't know how that happened but I'm really 
grateful that it was flagged and removed and it's going to be corrected,
 rightfully so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: I know. Well we 
were supposed to talk phoenix, but I'm out of time. And I think phoenix 
is going to continue to flounder around for a while.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: We just want people to get paid, like me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Are you having trouble getting paid?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: MPs aren't 
supposed to get paid, Don, but, no, I think it's, you know, across party
 lines, this is really affecting a lot of public servants and they need 
to, it needs to be fixed. MARTIN: Okay. Well we'll save the blame game 
for another time. All right, thank you all. Have a great break week and a
 happy Thanksgiving. Coming up, fighting back against the military's 
silent killer. Please stay with us.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Attego, the global leader
 of ESG impact solutions, announced today the launch of its new 
industry-leading ESG management platform--one that encompasses elements 
critical to both strong financial returns and positive environmental, 
social, and governance (ESG) impacts across the value chain of corporate
 clients.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 platform leverages advanced technologies and cognitive computing to 
resolve complex sustainability challenges faced by organizations and 
their partners across multiple industries and sectors. Named for its 
inherent benefit for users, the INSIGHT platform consists of three 
distinct solutions that form an integrated process while also serving as
 stand-alone products: altumINSIGHT for Social and Web Monitoring 
Intelligence, sensusINSIGHT for Community Perception and Behavioral 
Measurement, and valoremINSIGHT for Community and Social Investment 
Optimization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">altumINSIGHT combines an 
advanced analytics and monitoring engine with highly skilled analysts to
 monitor social media data related to a given industry, topic, or 
operation. It helps companies identify known stakeholder and community 
sentiment, understand trends across time, detect viral and fake news, 
and track shareholder reactions. The results position companies to be 
strategically responsive to change, capitalizing on opportunities and 
identifying minor issues before they evolve into major events or crises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">sensusINSIGHT is an 
in-depth data collection and analysis platform that measures and 
monitors how communities feel about an organization at the local and 
regional level. It establishes a baseline and provides ongoing services 
to benchmark that data over time. A core output is the <b>Social License</b>
 to Operate Index (SOLOi), a relative score that represents a company's 
ability to maintain efficient operations while avoiding community 
conflict.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">valoremINSIGHT is a 
rigorous financial platform that works in alignment with an 
organization's mission and business values to identify, optimize, 
execute, and track sustainability and CSR activities as an integrated 
portfolio of work, quantifying the ROI and positive impact of its 
investments. It helps attract capital through additional investment, 
yields cost-sharing and other efficiencies, and assists in developing 
lasting partnerships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Today's globalized 
business environment requires a multitude of factors to be monitored, 
measured, and managed for ongoing success," commented Jason Norman, 
Attego's managing director. "In coordinating and directing so many 
projects worldwide, we see organizations across many different 
industries struggling with similar challenges and risks. Increased 
connectivity means increased demands from shareholders, communities, and
 other groups; companies seeking sustainable operations face the 
ever-present need to evolve. In part, that means new thinking and new 
tools that enable the achievement of business objectives. Our INSIGHT 
platform not only addresses this evolution, but also offers clients a 
simplified approach to reaching their goals. We want to turn down the 
noise generated by confusing or disconnected service offerings and the 
many other inherent complications associated with solving ESG 
challenges."</p>

 the Toronto Star, the National Observer, Global News and journalism

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Documents obtained 
through freedom-of-information requests and from whistleblowers -

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government issued no 
public warning after Galloway reported the plume at her home because 
"there was no evidence that this was a widespread failure." But inside

H2S issues that led to years of meetings, audits and proposed regulatory
 reforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On April 7, 2014, 
government and industry officials deliberated about releasing data that

accused of hiding information," the notes read. "Public will want to 
know: 1. What are the areas? 2. How is it managed? 3. How is the

meeting. "Are we creating a risk by not releasing this data 
immediately?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite acknowledging 
"significant" public health risks from H2S, at least some officials

cases, fines aren't appropriate at all ... If there's an unsafe 
operation, it should be shut down. It shouldn't be operating. That's the
 best way to ensure the public safety is protected."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed fines were dropped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next month, Michael 
Bunz, a 38-year-old salesman supplying chemicals to oil and gas 
facilities, lay in a shack 80 kilometres from the Galloway house, dead 
after being exposed to H2S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The official incident 
report filed with the Ministry of the Economy, which regulates 
Saskatchewan's oilfields, makes no mention of Bunz's death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These regulators "are 
really thinking about the economic health of the province," says Emily 
Eaton, a professor at the University of Regina who has studied the 
relationship between the oil industry and the government. Eaton is a 
member of the Corporate Mapping Project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A shift in 2012 - from the Ministry of <b>Energy</b>
 and Resources to a new Ministry of the Economy tasked with regulating 
natural resource extraction and promoting economic development - changed
 the ministry's role from watchdog to partner, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're thinking about 
returns on investment ... The industry should really be regulated by 
those that have the interests of the environment first."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ministry field staff raised this concern at a meeting on July 1, 2015, between government and industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The role of the 
regulator needs to be adjusted," the meeting's minutes read. "The 
regulators are acting as consultants in some situations. The role of the
 regulator is to enforce the rules and if the rules are clear and if 
enforcement is consistent and clear then, 'cultural' changes can be 
made."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its statement, the ministry rejects criticisms of conflict of interest or lax enforcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Within the Ministry of 
the Economy, the petroleum and natural gas division carries out industry
 regulation," wrote the department's spokeswoman, Deb Young. "It is not 
involved in investment attraction, royalty and tax assessment and land 
sales. It is solely focused on well, facility and pipeline regulation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That regulation has not included fines or prosecutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry has not 
issued a single fine against any industry company "for well over a 
decade," Doug MacKnight, assistant deputy minister responsible for 
petroleum and natural gas, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Generally, we don't have
 to resort to that," he said. "It's usually just a notice to the 
operator to bring themselves into compliance."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prosecutions have also 
not been part of the ministry's enforcement practices because 
non-compliance was dealt with "through other enforcement actions," reads
 the ministry's statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other enforcement actions
 include increased inspections and staff, high-tech equipment for 
detecting emissions and a $69-million inspection reporting database 
(which can't be accessed by the public).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, complaints of illness from residents and workers continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I will sometimes get 
faint, like I will fall over and I have to find a seat quickly," says 
Lori Erhardt, a United Church minister and musician living near Oxbow 
who believes her chronic illness is related to&nbsp;emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I have had a variety of 
diagnoses, most of them end with "i-t-i-s," which means inflammation ...
 If something gets inflamed, if it's blood vesicles, you feel it through
 your body."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the five years' 
worth of documents obtained by this investigation is an April 2012 
PowerPoint presentation to CAPP members by the director of the 
province's petroleum and natural gas division. It includes a map of 
southeastern Saskatchewan showing a bloom of red and orange circles, 
labelled "critical sour gas locations."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sources say ministry 
staff pushed to make the data public but senior government officials 
said "there's no goddamn way that is going to be released," according to
 the former ministry source.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's an institutional
 reluctance to make this information public," he said. "The public 
should be able to see all the information that legislators have 
identified as public information such as sour gas and inspection 
reports."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry statement 
says the map was never approved for release because some data was out of
 date, not comprehensive and "could provide the public and industry with
 a false understanding of risk associated with a particular well or 
facility."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the Galloway 
incident, the ministry inspected 11 oil and gas facilities. All failed 
"with serious infractions," including releasing H2S at lethal levels 
"that may be exceeding 150,000 (parts per million)," Brad Herald, CAPP's
 Saskatchewan operations manager, wrote to the board of governors in 
December 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those levels are 150 times the amount that could cause instant death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the causes: "It is 
believed that inadequate training on the installation and operation of 
equipment is ... contributing to the air quality issues."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPP's Abel said in an interview the "unsafe" facilities responsible for those breaches should not have been operating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They should have been 
shut down," he said. "When you follow the rules, processing and 
production of sour gas is absolutely safe. If you don't follow the 
rules, it can pose a health risk. So ultimately, those operators at 
those facilities were responsible."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither CAPP nor its industry partners made the health risks public. And no ministry fines or prosecutions followed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Internally, CAPP quickly mobilized to develop a public relations and damage control plan:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are growing public
 concerns regarding the air quality issues in southeast Saskatchewan," 
Herald wrote, noting a petition and a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Ministry fields one 
to two public complaints concerning odours per week and the issue is 
garnering increasing political attention . . . This has the potential to
 become a broader industry reputation/<b>social license</b> concern and 
warrants immediate attention by operators in the region . . . 
Communications is preparing key messages in the event that there is 
media profile."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPP received a warning 
the next month after consulting a scientist with expertise on managing 
toxic substances, internal emails show. The scientist expressed 
disappointment noting that H2S failures were "so easy to avoid."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientist urged the 
industry lobby group to develop and implement a new code of practice to 
control dangerous emissions and get ahead of the problem by publicly 
denouncing unacceptable practices. The scientist also recommended that 
the industry group pressure the province to step up inspections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry, in meetings with industry, proposed similar reforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter sent in March 2013 then-<b>energy</b>
 minister Tim McMillan - now president and CEO of CAPP - warned 
companies to meet "compliance obligations" or face "escalated 
enforcement, penalty and/or prosecution."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ministry and industry met
 four times between 2012 and 2014 to plot strategy, including emergency 
planning zones, a public communications document, a code of practice and
 a licensing regime for high-risk, single-well batteries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those plans were never adopted, a ministry statement confirms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Instead, the Ministry 
chose to take a risk-based approach to managing the sour gas issue that 
included increased field inspections and improved data collection." 
Eighteen wells that had been venting sour gas were ordered to be 
"shut-in" in 2012/2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 2013 to the summer 
of 2014, the ministry began implementing "an aggressive inspection and 
enforcement schedule to reduce sour gas emission" that included 
suspension orders against 30 facilities owing to "H2S management 
issues," the statement reads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During that effort, H2S would claim its most high-profile victim in Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Bunz, a salesman 
for Nalco Champion, died on May 22, 2014, while taking samples in a shed
 located in a provincial park between Carlyle and Kipling. A valve on 
the tank broke and oil, water and H2S spewed into his face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An incident report submitted by the tank's owner, <span class="companylink">Harvest Operations Corp</span>., states simply: "Spill occurred as a result of a failed valve."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nowhere does it mention Bunz's death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, his death is 
marked by a gravestone in a small cemetery near Wawota, where the father
 of two young daughters lived a few doors away from his parents, Dianne 
and Allan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The black, polished 
stone, with an image of Bunz wearing his Saskatchewan Roughriders jersey
 and hat, calls him "Bunzy" and reads: "In loving memory of Emma and 
Olivia's Daddy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He didn't really talk 
about those dangers," Dianne says. "We knew what it's like to work in 
the oil industry. My husband did for 20 years. We knew about H2S but I 
wasn't aware that he was going on site and doing the testing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The summer before he 
died, Allan drove his son to the Nalco office to quit. Michael's 
brother-in-law, who had worked there, had left and "things had been 
pretty tough," Michael said, marked by long days and heavy workload.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He was going to hand his
 company truck in, and his boss was there ... he talked (Michael) out of
 it," Allan says. "This company wanted him because he never ever phoned 
in sick or anything. He'd just go to work. And they offered him more 
money, so he stayed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nalco Champion is facing 
three charges under the province's occupational health and safety 
legislation for failing to provide Bunz with a respirator and to ensure 
he entered a dangerous situation with a second worker. A conviction 
would result in a fine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family says they were
 told by Nalco that the concentration of H2S in the fluids was estimated
 at 40,000 parts per million, more than enough to bring near-instant 
death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company sent reporters a written statement, declining further comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We remain deeply 
saddened by the loss of our colleague, Michael Bunz. The safety of our 
associates, customers and communities is vitally important, and we 
remain committed to our robust safety policies, protocols and training 
programs, which include those related to hydrogen sulfide," it reads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allan, who spent most of 
his working life in the oil industry, says he learned more about H2S 
protection when he worked on a pig farm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Every person had to wear
 an H2S monitor. And I'm talking about the pig industry," he says. "To 
me, they were protecting us ... more at this simple small hog operation 
in Saskatchewan than the oil industry ever did the entire time I was 
working out there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple reviewed the 
records documenting years of discussions between government and industry
 about public health risks and failed audits that were never made 
public. The couple called it "devastating."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I go to work every day 
and I drive down the highway and I talk to my son sitting beside me," 
says Allan. "I say to him "tough day there, son" and I tell him how I 
feel . . . I feel him sitting there beside me."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How often H2S incidents happen or happened in Saskatchewan remains a mystery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officially, ministry 
officials count one death and five "documented incidents where a member 
of the public was exposed to unsafe levels of sour gas near a well or 
facility site."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of them triggered a public statement by the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There was no need for public notification since the incident was quickly dealt with at the site," reads the ministry statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after dozens of 
interviews it is clear that H2S incidents involving residents are more 
common but go unreported or are not recorded properly. This is also true
 for workers in the oilfield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only months after Bunz 
died, Trina Hansen, an oilfield worker and part-time voice actress, was 
clearing a pipeline near Carlyle, Sask.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I could have died," she 
says. "It's almost like you could feel like a heavy air hit your face. 
It's a really weird feeling. Your first reaction is to inhale. When it 
hits your face, you breathe it in. It's the weirdest thing. You don't 
think to hold your breath. It happens so fast. I stumbled backwards. I 
was so shocked."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disoriented, Hansen got 
back in her truck and drove a couple of kilometres until she noticed she
 was losing her peripheral vision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There were white 
sparkles, iridescent, swirly, super-shiny and bright. I jumped out and 
started feeling nauseous and couldn't breathe very well. I was trying to
 catch my breath and dry heaving. My head started pounding."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hansen, suffering debilitating headaches, nausea and sickness, lost her voice for two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This happened three 
years ago and I still have a hard time catching my breath if I talk too 
fast. I'm very short of breath. I've never in my life felt like that. It
 was horrible."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her voice has changed for good - it is far deeper and lower than before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I do a cartoon on APTN 
network and they said my voice totally changed. It changed two octaves 
pretty much. It used to be high and now it cuts out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hansen never reported the incident, fearing she would lose her job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Nobody wants to say 
anything. We know it's bad and dangerous. But no one wants to raise a 
fuss. And being a woman and trying to prove yourself out there, I never 
claimed WCB (Workers Compensation Board). The economy went down and I 
have to pay off debt with my trucking money."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four months after Bunz's 
death, a secret ministry report listed 161 facilities "that may be in 
violation of (the ministry's) sour gas emission control."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The catch: "time and 
resources required to investigate and verify violations would take all 
available field officers over a year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2014, inspections of 
60 suspicious wells in 2014 turned up 36 - more than half - that were 
leaking so badly they had to be shut down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another audit found 11 
out of 12 facilities failed inspection "due to H2S venting" and found 29
 locations that are too close to facilities with high levels of H2S 
concentrations. Of the 1,352 active sour gas facilities, only 421 - 31 
per cent - had "proper emission control systems."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Almost every site had 
improper gas measurement," the report reads. "Discovered major 
contamination at two facilities as a result of spill which were not 
reported" to the ministry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry believes 
that the H2S issue is under control, saying air quality standards are 
being met and that inspections confirm that companies' sour gas 
management practices have improved. Today 27 full-time inspectors are 
responsible for the province's 126,000 wells and its estimated 118,000 
kilometres of pipelines and flowlines, operating with a budget of $3.9 
million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2016-17, ministry staff inspected 18,340 wells, facilities and pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, a team of 
researchers from Harvard and Northeastern Universities collected data in
 collaboration with this investigation using the same instruments 
employed by ministry inspectors to detect emissions invisible to the 
naked eye.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In my experience 
measuring oil and gas activities in Texas, what struck me was that about
 a third of the sites we looked at had what we believed to be fugitive 
emissions and the high density of pump jacks," says Lourdes Vera, a 
doctoral student in environmental sociology at <span class="companylink">Northeastern University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Michanowicz, a 
post-doctoral researcher at Harvard University's School of Public Health
 who led the survey in Saskatchewan, said about one in five of the 
facilities they visited showed black smoke rising from the flaring 
stacks of production facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If there is black smoke,
 there is particulate matter that if inhaled is certainly associated 
with human health effects," he said. "If sources of these air pollutants
 are constantly impacting individuals where they live, work and play, 
there is the worry that they are experiencing health effects."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In interviews with 
landowners and records in the government database, this investigation 
has found recent H2S accidents, including three people who say they were
 sickened by H2S clouds near their homes in the past year. One said they
 required hospitalization after a near-fatal incident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, more than 
four years after the H2S incident in Galloway's front yard, she and her 
husband were driving home when they encountered a plume of what she 
believes was H2S gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She fell ill and stayed home for three days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've had arrhythmias, really wicked headaches ... I've had bouts of nausea. I wake up at night and have heart palpitations."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Galloway wrote to public officials demanding a response.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were no 
consequences or fines as a result. And no official report of an incident
 anywhere near the Galloway property that day was filed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, says Galloway, is just the way it works in Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As a person living in 
the middle of the oilfield, you have no protection. The government 
doesn't care. Your MLA doesn't care. The oil companies don't care."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unprecedented Collaboration Behind the Project</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the past nine 
months, an unprecedented collaboration of more than 50 journalists and 
editors from three Canadian media outlets, four journalism schools and a
 think tank have worked to chronicle the hidden price of oil in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Collectively, reporters 
examined thousands of industry and government documents, analyzed 
terabytes of data and delved into dozens of freedom-of-information 
requests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The project started with
 the people," says Patti Sonntag, a managing editor in the New York 
Times' news services division, who launched the project with a grant 
from the Michener Awards Foundation. Following a tip from a colleague at
 the Corporate Mapping Project, she did some research and reporting in 
Saskatchewan last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working with the previous
 year's Michener winner, Toronto Star journalist Robert Cribb, Sonntag 
created a team of students at the Ryerson, Concordia and UBC journalism 
schools. <span class="companylink">Concordia University</span>'s Department of Journalism volunteered to act as host and headquarters for the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">University of Regina 
students reported on the ground locally, shot video and developed 
sources, while students at the other universities aggregated and 
analyzed data and interviewed experts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're pulling these four
 different schools from across the country and looking at it from all 
different aspects," says Janelle Blakley, a University of Regina student
 reporter whose team mapped spills data and met local farmers and 
residents. "This collaboration allowed us to really dig into it, where 
all schools were pulling apart different pieces of it and then coming 
back and putting it all together."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The significance of the 
data quickly drew intrigue. What emerged was a picture of a few 
dedicated regulators - and even some industry leaders - who tried to 
introduce greater accountability, but these efforts were ultimately 
overwhelmed by larger forces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You start to understand 
these figures really do play a huge role in dictating the direction of 
the Canadian economy and that plays out in the lives of everyday 
Canadians," says Lauren Kaljur, a graduate of UBC's master of journalism
 program who has been investigating the concentration of corporate power
 in Saskatchewan's oil and gas industry since the beginning of 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Matthew Gilmour, a recent journalism graduate at <span class="companylink">Concordia University</span>,
 after spending months populating spreadsheets and ledgers, "there's the
 human moment where you realize it's not just a pocketbook story. It's a
 human story. And people's lives are affected."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work continued past 
the end of the semester in April 2017, with students working alongside 
veteran reporters at the Star, the National Observer and Global News to 
shape the stories, seek comments from all sides and publish hundreds of 
pages of government and industry records, detailing concerns about 
potentially deadly gas emissions for the first time.&nbsp;- Steph

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late in the afternoon of Oct. 30, 2012, Galloway, a 53-year-old registered nurse, heard screams from the front yard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Galloway dashed out to 
find a teenage family member vomiting and the air thick with the 
rotten-egg smell of sour gas — hydrogen sulphide (H2S).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Galloway, who trains oil workers to survive these same events, knew what to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She pulled the teen 
inside, grabbed an air monitor and held it out the door. The reading was
 off the dial — more than 100 parts per million — a level immediately 
dangerous to human health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saskatchewan's oil boom has brought jobs for many. For others, it has brought fear, injury and one death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of “fracked”

nearly 3,000 in 2013, according to a 2016 paper by the <span class="companylink">Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives</span>.
 The promise of prosperity, similar to its southern neighbour North

 by the Toronto Star, the National Observer, Global News and journalism

Saskatchewan has strengthened its sour gas 
monitoring[https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2017/10/05/saskatchewan-has-strengthened-its-sour-gas-monitoring.html]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Documents obtained 
through freedom-of-information requests and from whistleblowers — 
internal correspondence, meeting minutes, presentations and inspection 
reports — disclose findings of failures in performance by oil and gas 
companies, including serious infractions, failed safety audits, daily 
H2S readings beyond provincial air quality standards and a death in 
2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet regulatory standards remain largely unchanged and H2S incidents and risks remain hidden from the public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The teen overcome in Galloway's yard eventually recovered but missed school for several days with nausea and headaches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">H2S can be an insidious killer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heavier than air, it tends to settle in ravines and valleys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just above the level 
Galloway's monitor detected — 100 parts per million — H2S causes 
olfactory paralysis, leaving a victim unable to detect the rotten-egg 
smell. Continued exposure at that level may cause death within 48 hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A person exposed to a 
highly concentrated plume of the gas — at 1,000 parts per million — may 
die rapidly from respiratory paralysis, or over the course of days, from
 an inflammatory reaction in the lungs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Victims effectively suffocate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government issued no 
public warning after Galloway reported the plume at her home because 
“there was no evidence that this was a widespread failure.” But inside 
government and industry offices, documents indicate the seriousness of 
H2S issues that led to years of meetings, audits and proposed regulatory
 reforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On April 7, 2014, 
government and industry officials deliberated about releasing data that 
showed H2S “hotspots” across southeastern Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Government may be 
accused of hiding information,” the notes read. “Public will want to 
know: 1. What are the areas? 2. How is it managed? 3. How is the 
government making sure it's managed?” one unnamed official told the 
meeting. “Are we creating a risk by not releasing this data 
immediately?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite acknowledging 
“significant” public health risks from H2S, at least some officials 
present expressed concern about “sensitivity in this data (because) 
there are residents living in these areas.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No release followed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three weeks later, 
government-proposed fines for emission breaches — up to $1 million in 
penalties — were rejected by two major industry groups. In a letter to 
the ministry dated April 29, 2014, the <span class="companylink">Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) </span>and Explorers and Producers Association of Canada (EPAC) called the proposed penalties “unsuitable.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A former ministry 
official, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of losing his 
current job in the industry, says “almost every amendment was being 
rejected.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EPAC officials declined comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terry Abel, CAPP's 
spokesperson, said the letter was intended to explain that, “in some 
cases, fines aren't appropriate at all … If there's an unsafe operation,
 it should be shut down. It shouldn't be operating. That's the best way 
to ensure the public safety is protected.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed fines were dropped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next month, Michael 
Bunz, a 38-year-old salesman supplying chemicals to oil and gas 
facilities, lay in a shack 80 kilometres from the Galloway house, dead 
after being exposed to H2S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The official incident 
report filed with the Ministry of the Economy, which regulates 
Saskatchewan's oilfields, makes no mention of Bunz's death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These regulators “are 
really thinking about the economic health of the province,” says Emily 
Eaton, a professor at the University of Regina who has studied the 
relationship between the oil industry and the government. Eaton is a 
member of the Corporate Mapping Project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A shift in 2012 — from the Ministry of <b>Energy</b>
 and Resources to a new Ministry of the Economy tasked with regulating 
natural resource extraction and promoting economic development — changed
 the ministry's role from watchdog to partner, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They're thinking about 
returns on investment … The industry should really be regulated by those
 that have the interests of the environment first.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ministry field staff raised this concern at a meeting on July 1, 2015, between government and industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The role of the 
regulator needs to be adjusted,” the meeting's minutes read. “The 
regulators are acting as consultants in some situations. The role of the
 regulator is to enforce the rules and if the rules are clear and if 
enforcement is consistent and clear then, 'cultural' changes can be 
made.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its statement, the ministry rejects criticisms of conflict of interest or lax enforcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Within the Ministry of 
the Economy, the petroleum and natural gas division carries out industry
 regulation,” wrote the department's spokeswoman, Deb Young. “It is not 
involved in investment attraction, royalty and tax assessment and land 
sales. It is solely focused on well, facility and pipeline regulation.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That regulation has not included fines or prosecutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry has not 
issued a single fine against any industry company “for well over a 
decade,” Doug MacKnight, assistant deputy minister responsible for 
petroleum and natural gas, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Generally, we don't have
 to resort to that,” he said. “It's usually just a notice to the 
operator to bring themselves into compliance.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prosecutions have also 
not been part of the ministry's enforcement practices because 
non-compliance was dealt with “through other enforcement actions,” reads
 the ministry's statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other enforcement actions
 include increased inspections and staff, high-tech equipment for 
detecting emissions and a $69-million inspection reporting database 
(which can't be accessed by the public).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, complaints of illness from residents and workers continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I will sometimes get 
faint, like I will fall over and I have to find a seat quickly,” says 
Lori Erhardt, a United Church minister and musician living near Oxbow 
who believes her chronic illness is related to emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I have had a variety of 
diagnoses, most of them end with “i-t-i-s,” which means inflammation … 
If something gets inflamed, if it's blood vesicles, you feel it through 
your body.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the five years' 
worth of documents obtained by this investigation is an April 2012 
PowerPoint presentation to CAPP members by the director of the 
province's petroleum and natural gas division. It includes a map of 
southeastern Saskatchewan showing a bloom of red and orange circles, 
labelled “critical sour gas locations.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sources say ministry 
staff pushed to make the data public but senior government officials 
said “there's no goddamn way that is going to be released,” according to
 the former ministry source.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's an institutional
 reluctance to make this information public,” he said. “The public 
should be able to see all the information that legislators have 
identified as public information such as sour gas and inspection 
reports.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry statement 
says the map was never approved for release because some data was out of
 date, not comprehensive and “could provide the public and industry with
 a false understanding of risk associated with a particular well or 
facility.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the Galloway 
incident, the ministry inspected 11 oil and gas facilities. All failed 
“with serious infractions,” including releasing H2S at lethal levels 
“that may be exceeding 150,000 (parts per million),” Brad Herald, CAPP's
 Saskatchewan operations manager, wrote to the board of governors in 
December 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those levels are 150 times the amount that could cause instant death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the causes: “It is 
believed that inadequate training on the installation and operation of 
equipment is … contributing to the air quality issues.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPP's Abel said in an interview the “unsafe” facilities responsible for those breaches should not have been operating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They should have been 
shut down,” he said. “When you follow the rules, processing and 
production of sour gas is absolutely safe. If you don't follow the 
rules, it can pose a health risk. So ultimately, those operators at 
those facilities were responsible.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither CAPP nor its industry partners made the health risks public. And no ministry fines or prosecutions followed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Internally, CAPP quickly mobilized to develop a public relations and damage control plan:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are growing public
 concerns regarding the air quality issues in southeast Saskatchewan,” 
Herald wrote, noting a petition and a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The Ministry fields one 
to two public complaints concerning odours per week and the issue is 
garnering increasing political attention . . . This has the potential to
 become a broader industry reputation/<b>social license</b> concern and 
warrants immediate attention by operators in the region . . . 
Communications is preparing key messages in the event that there is 
media profile.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPP received a warning 
the next month after consulting a scientist with expertise on managing 
toxic substances, internal emails show. The scientist expressed 
disappointment noting that H2S failures were “so easy to avoid.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientist urged the 
industry lobby group to develop and implement a new code of practice to 
control dangerous emissions and get ahead of the problem by publicly 
denouncing unacceptable practices. The scientist also recommended that 
the industry group pressure the province to step up inspections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry, in meetings with industry, proposed similar reforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter sent in March 2013 then-<b>energy</b>
 minister Tim McMillan — now president and CEO of CAPP — warned 
companies to meet “compliance obligations” or face “escalated 
enforcement, penalty and/or prosecution.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ministry and industry met
 four times between 2012 and 2014 to plot strategy, including emergency 
planning zones, a public communications document, a code of practice and
 a licensing regime for high-risk, single-well batteries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those plans were never adopted, a ministry statement confirms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Instead, the Ministry 
chose to take a risk-based approach to managing the sour gas issue that 
included increased field inspections and improved data collection.” 
Eighteen wells that had been venting sour gas were ordered to be 
“shut-in” in 2012/2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 2013 to the summer 
of 2014, the ministry began implementing “an aggressive inspection and 
enforcement schedule to reduce sour gas emission” that included 
suspension orders against 30 facilities owing to “H2S management 
issues,” the statement reads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During that effort, H2S would claim its most high-profile victim in Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Bunz, a salesman 
for Nalco Champion, died on May 22, 2014, while taking samples in a shed
 located in a provincial park between Carlyle and Kipling. A valve on 
the tank broke and oil, water and H2S spewed into his face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An incident report submitted by the tank's owner, <span class="companylink">Harvest Operations Corp</span>., states simply: “Spill occurred as a result of a failed valve.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nowhere does it mention Bunz's death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, his death is 
marked by a gravestone in a small cemetery near Wawota, where the father
 of two young daughters lived a few doors away from his parents, Dianne 
and Allan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The black, polished 
stone, with an image of Bunz wearing his Saskatchewan Roughriders jersey
 and hat, calls him “Bunzy” and reads: “In loving memory of Emma and 
Olivia's Daddy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He didn't really talk 
about those dangers,” Dianne says. “We knew what it's like to work in 
the oil industry. My husband did for 20 years. We knew about H2S but I 
wasn't aware that he was going on site and doing the testing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The summer before he 
died, Allan drove his son to the Nalco office to quit. Michael's 
brother-in-law, who had worked there, had left and “things had been 
pretty tough,” Michael said, marked by long days and heavy workload.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He was going to hand his
 company truck in, and his boss was there … he talked (Michael) out of 
it,” Allan says. “This company wanted him because he never ever phoned 
in sick or anything. He'd just go to work. And they offered him more 
money, so he stayed.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nalco Champion is facing 
three charges under the province's occupational health and safety 
legislation for failing to provide Bunz with a respirator and to ensure 
he entered a dangerous situation with a second worker. A conviction 
would result in a fine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family says they were
 told by Nalco that the concentration of H2S in the fluids was estimated
 at 40,000 parts per million, more than enough to bring near-instant 
death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company sent reporters a written statement, declining further comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We remain deeply 
saddened by the loss of our colleague, Michael Bunz. The safety of our 
associates, customers and communities is vitally important, and we 
remain committed to our robust safety policies, protocols and training 
programs, which include those related to hydrogen sulfide,” it reads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allan, who spent most of 
his working life in the oil industry, says he learned more about H2S 
protection when he worked on a pig farm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Every person had to wear
 an H2S monitor. And I'm talking about the pig industry,” he says. “To 
me, they were protecting us … more at this simple small hog operation in
 Saskatchewan than the oil industry ever did the entire time I was 
working out there.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple reviewed the 
records documenting years of discussions between government and industry
 about public health risks and failed audits that were never made 
public. The couple called it “devastating.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I go to work every day 
and I drive down the highway and I talk to my son sitting beside me,” 
says Allan. “I say to him “tough day there, son” and I tell him how I 
feel . . . I feel him sitting there beside me.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How often H2S incidents happen or happened in Saskatchewan remains a mystery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officially, ministry 
officials count one death and five “documented incidents where a member 
of the public was exposed to unsafe levels of sour gas near a well or 
facility site.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of them triggered a public statement by the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There was no need for public notification since the incident was quickly dealt with at the site,” reads the ministry statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after dozens of 
interviews it is clear that H2S incidents involving residents are more 
common but go unreported or are not recorded properly. This is also true
 for workers in the oilfield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only months after Bunz 
died, Trina Hansen, an oilfield worker and part-time voice actress, was 
clearing a pipeline near Carlyle, Sask.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I could have died,” she 
says. “It's almost like you could feel like a heavy air hit your face. 
It's a really weird feeling. Your first reaction is to inhale. When it 
hits your face, you breathe it in. It's the weirdest thing. You don't 
think to hold your breath. It happens so fast. I stumbled backwards. I 
was so shocked.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disoriented, Hansen got 
back in her truck and drove a couple of kilometres until she noticed she
 was losing her peripheral vision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There were white 
sparkles, iridescent, swirly, super-shiny and bright. I jumped out and 
started feeling nauseous and couldn't breathe very well. I was trying to
 catch my breath and dry heaving. My head started pounding.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hansen, suffering debilitating headaches, nausea and sickness, lost her voice for two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This happened three 
years ago and I still have a hard time catching my breath if I talk too 
fast. I'm very short of breath. I've never in my life felt like that. It
 was horrible.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her voice has changed for good — it is far deeper and lower than before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I do a cartoon on <span class="companylink">APTN</span> network and they said my voice totally changed. It changed two octaves pretty much. It used to be high and now it cuts out.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hansen never reported the incident, fearing she would lose her job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Nobody wants to say 
anything. We know it's bad and dangerous. But no one wants to raise a 
fuss. And being a woman and trying to prove yourself out there, I never 
claimed WCB (Workers Compensation Board). The economy went down and I 
have to pay off debt with my trucking money.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four months after Bunz's 
death, a secret ministry report listed 161 facilities “that may be in 
violation of (the ministry's) sour gas emission control.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The catch: “time and 
resources required to investigate and verify violations would take all 
available field officers over a year.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2014, inspections of 
60 suspicious wells in 2014 turned up 36 — more than half — that were 
leaking so badly they had to be shut down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another audit found 11 
out of 12 facilities failed inspection “due to H2S venting” and found 29
 locations that are too close to facilities with high levels of H2S 
concentrations. Of the 1,352 active sour gas facilities, only 421 — 31 
per cent — had “proper emission control systems.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Almost every site had 
improper gas measurement,” the report reads. “Discovered major 
contamination at two facilities as a result of spill which were not 
reported” to the ministry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry believes 
that the H2S issue is under control, saying air quality standards are 
being met and that inspections confirm that companies' sour gas 
management practices have improved. Today 27 full-time inspectors are 
responsible for the province's 126,000 wells and its estimated 118,000 
kilometres of pipelines and flowlines, operating with a budget of $3.9 
million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2016-17, ministry staff inspected 18,340 wells, facilities and pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, a team of 
researchers from Harvard and Northeastern Universities collected data in
 collaboration with this investigation using the same instruments 
employed by ministry inspectors to detect emissions invisible to the 
naked eye.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In my experience 
measuring oil and gas activities in Texas, what struck me was that about
 a third of the sites we looked at had what we believed to be fugitive 
emissions and the high density of pump jacks,” says Lourdes Vera, a 
doctoral student in environmental sociology at <span class="companylink">Northeastern University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Michanowicz, a 
post-doctoral researcher at Harvard University's School of Public Health
 who led the survey in Saskatchewan, said about one in five of the 
facilities they visited showed black smoke rising from the flaring 
stacks of production facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If there is black smoke,
 there is particulate matter that if inhaled is certainly associated 
with human health effects,” he said. “If sources of these air pollutants
 are constantly impacting individuals where they live, work and play, 
there is the worry that they are experiencing health effects.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In interviews with 
landowners and records in the government database, this investigation 
has found recent H2S accidents, including three people who say they were
 sickened by H2S clouds near their homes in the past year. One said they
 required hospitalization after a near-fatal incident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, more than 
four years after the H2S incident in Galloway's front yard, she and her 
husband were driving home when they encountered a plume of what she 
believes was H2S gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She fell ill and stayed home for three days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I've had arrhythmias, really wicked headaches … I've had bouts of nausea. I wake up at night and have heart palpitations.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Galloway wrote to public officials demanding a response.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were no 
consequences or fines as a result. And no official report of an incident
 anywhere near the Galloway property that day was filed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, says Galloway, is just the way it works in Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As a person living in 
the middle of the oilfield, you have no protection. The government 
doesn't care. Your MLA doesn't care. The oil companies don't care.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unprecedented Collaboration Behind the Project</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the past nine 
months, an unprecedented collaboration of more than 50 journalists and 
editors from three Canadian media outlets, four journalism schools and a
 think tank have worked to chronicle the hidden price of oil in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Collectively, reporters 
examined thousands of industry and government documents, analyzed 
terabytes of data and delved into dozens of freedom-of-information 
requests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The project started with the people,” says Patti Sonntag, a managing editor in the <span class="companylink">New York Times</span>'
 news services division, who launched the project with a grant from the 
Michener Awards Foundation. Following a tip from a colleague at the 
Corporate Mapping Project, she did some research and reporting in 
Saskatchewan last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working with the previous
 year's Michener winner, Toronto Star journalist Robert Cribb, Sonntag 
created a team of students at the Ryerson, Concordia and UBC journalism 
schools. <span class="companylink">Concordia University</span>'s Department of Journalism volunteered to act as host and headquarters for the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">University of Regina 
students reported on the ground locally, shot video and developed 
sources, while students at the other universities aggregated and 
analyzed data and interviewed experts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're pulling these four
 different schools from across the country and looking at it from all 
different aspects,” says Janelle Blakley, a University of Regina student
 reporter whose team mapped spills data and met local farmers and 
residents. “This collaboration allowed us to really dig into it, where 
all schools were pulling apart different pieces of it and then coming 
back and putting it all together.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The significance of the 
data quickly drew intrigue. What emerged was a picture of a few 
dedicated regulators — and even some industry leaders — who tried to 
introduce greater accountability, but these efforts were ultimately 
overwhelmed by larger forces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You start to understand 
these figures really do play a huge role in dictating the direction of 
the Canadian economy and that plays out in the lives of everyday 
Canadians,” says Lauren Kaljur, a graduate of UBC's master of journalism
 program who has been investigating the concentration of corporate power
 in Saskatchewan's oil and gas industry since the beginning of 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Matthew Gilmour, a recent journalism graduate at <span class="companylink">Concordia University</span>,
 after spending months populating spreadsheets and ledgers, “there's the
 human moment where you realize it's not just a pocketbook story. It's a
 human story. And people's lives are affected.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work continued past 
the end of the semester in April 2017, with students working alongside 
veteran reporters at the Star, the National Observer and Global News to 
shape the stories, seek comments from all sides and publish hundreds of 
pages of government and industry records, detailing concerns about 
potentially deadly gas emissions for the first time. — Steph Wechsler/
