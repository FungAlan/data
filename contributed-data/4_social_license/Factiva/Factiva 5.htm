<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently
 in Ontario, Premier Doug Ford summarily scrapped Ontario's cap-andtrade
 program, which would have burdened Ontario companies with costly carbon
 accounting and sent millions of Ontario's dollars to California to buy 
carbon credits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2017, Ontarians paid nearly $2 billion annually as the cost of cap-and-trade was passed onto consumers.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover,
 Ontario will cancel some 758 contracts for renewable power, saving the 
province another $790 million while helping reduce power prices for 
Ontarians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides partying at 
Stampede and doing aerial acrobatics, what has Premier Rachel Notley 
done to increase investment attractiveness in Alberta? Let's review. 
Since coming to office, she raised corporate income taxes to 12% from 
10% - a hike of about 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And discouraged wealthier folks, who might live and invest here, by killing Alberta's highly attractive flat income tax rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Due to this tax hike, 
which went from 10% up to 15% for high earners, Albertans who earn more 
than $300,000 per year saw their taxes rise 50%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP government has 
also stacked a daunting pile of regulatory bricks onto the back of a 
prostrate industry when it was reeling from a massive drop in oil 
prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Canada's energy 
sector was down, they were hit with Premier Notley's "Climate Leadership
 Plan," which expanded and increased Alberta's carbon tax to $30/tonne 
of emissions, and will ostensibly follow the Trudeau government's 
federal plan to raise the tax to $50/tonne by 2022, as her contingent 
condition of getting a <b>pipeline</b> built was satisfied by Ottawa's purchase of the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain expansion project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the tax 
hikes, the government put a hard cap on the emissions of greenhouse 
gases from the oilsands, limiting them to 100 megatonnes per year, a 
constraint which could start to bite in the mid-2020s, threatening the 
viability of longterm projects and costing the economy billions in lost 
production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's Climate 
Leadership Plan also includes a commitment to phase out coal-generated 
electricity by 2030, triple renewable energy to supply 30% of generation
 by 2030, further reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector, 
and create a new agency to spend Alberta's carbon tax revenues on 
energy-efficiency programs with a very poor record of success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drove up prices</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are the kind of policies that drove up energy prices in Ontario and drove investment and jobs out of the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simply put, as Ontario 
steps back from cap-andtrade and wind and solar power, Alberta forges 
ahead with burdensome regulations, renewable energy subsidies and higher
 taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And all of this after the spectacular failure of Premier Notley's "<b>social license</b>" dream that was never going to be granted by environmentalists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, we now have a 
precedent that, if pipelines are to be built, the government must fund 
them or indemnify them with Alberta's and Canada's tax dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the premier is serious
 about rebuilding Alberta's oil and gas sector, she should get off the 
Stampede zip-line and start removing the bricks she put on the back of 
Alberta's energy economy, to make Alberta a profitable place to invest 
with a more predictable and affordable regulatory system.</p>

 pundits should not be so quick to write off the new Doug Ford-Scott Moe
 alliance against the federal carbon tax. Yes, they were the only two of
 the 10 premiers in New Brunswick this week to announce their support 
for a constitutional challenge to the federal law. And yes 
constitutional experts are correct in predicting that this legal 
challenge is not likely to succeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But winning in the legal 
battle does not mean winning the policy war. Obstructionist provincial 
governments can gum up federal policies whose effective implementation 
require provincial co-operation. Witness how B.C. Premier Phil Horgan 
and his anti-<b>pipeline</b> allies have succeeded in delaying the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> <b>pipeline</b> expansion despite losing 17 consecutive court decisions.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With
 respect to the carbon tax, the law may be on the side of Ottawa, but 
time and politics are not. Saskatchewan's reference to its court of 
appeal won't be decided for another nine months. Whoever loses will 
appeal to the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>, 
which will take another year or more to be heard and then decided. By 
then, there will have been a spring election in Alberta and a federal 
election in the fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Alberta, Conservative 
leader Jason Kenney is promising to scrap that province's carbon tax if 
he wins next year's election. All current polling suggests that he will.
 Manitoba has adopted its own version of a carbon tax, but the price it 
places on CO2 is below the minimum demanded by the federal plan. Premier
 Pallister has warned that if Ottawa tries to force it higher, "we'll 
see you in court." PEI has adopted a climate change plan with no carbon 
tax - a policy that clearly does not meet federal regulations. And if 
anti-tax momentum builds, the Newfoundland and New Brunswick premiers 
have warned that they are not going impose a tax on their voters that 
consumers and businesses in six or seven other provinces are not paying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Jason Kenney speaks to the media at his first convention as leader of 
the United Conservative Party in Red Deer, Alta., Sunday, May 6, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With next year's federal 
election fast approaching, this is potential nightmare scenario for 
Trudeau and the Liberals. Do they want to make the ballot-issue a new 
tax that will make it more expensive for voters to fill up their cars, 
heat their homes and turn on their lights? Maybe this won't make any 
difference in Saskatchewan and Alberta, where the Liberals only have 
five MPs. But in Ontario - where Doug Ford just won by promising to 
scrap the tax - the Liberals have 80 MPs seeking re-election. Losing 
even a quarter of these would jeopardize their 183 seat government, 
which is only 13 over the 170 minimum required for a majority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2015, many 
centre-right voters supported Trudeau simply because they were tired of 
Stephen Harper. But in 2018, they supported Doug Ford because they were 
tired of sky-rocketing electricity and gas prices. If in 2019 Trudeau 
takes a hardline on bringing back the very carbon tax that Premier Ford 
has just repealed, he risks losing some of these former supporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the alternative - 
backing off on the carbon tax - has its own risks. Promising action on 
climate change was one of the issues that helped Trudeau win in 2015. 
With the help of the U.S.-financed environmental NGO (ENGO) LeadNow, the
 Liberals targeted 29 Conservative-held ridings in which their polling 
indicated that climate change was a priority for voters. Liberal 
candidates subsequently won 25 of these seats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these same 
centre-left voters that supported Trudeau in 2015 are no longer so happy
 with him. Many are angry about the federal government's $4.5 billion 
bailout of the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> <b>pipeline</b>
 expansion in B.C. If Trudeau now backs down on his national carbon tax 
pledge, many of his 2015 supporters for whom climate action is still a 
priority may drift off to the NDP in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underlying the Liberals' carbon tax dilemma is the spectacular failure of the Trudeau-Notley "<b>social license</b>"
 gambit: their belief that in return for their various carbon reduction 
policies, climate change ENGOs would acquiesce in Canada's economic need
 to build the Kinder Morgan TransMountain expansion. Whatever 
plausibility this trade-off strategy may have had initially has now been
 destroyed. The anti-Kinder Morgan forces - the Horgan government, U.S. 
and Canadian climate ENGOs and B.C. aboriginal groups - have accelerated
 their opposition to TransMountain, not backed off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor are they shy about 
explaining why. When CBC asked Bill McKibben( 
http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1100225603963[http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1100225603963]
 ), founder of <span class="companylink">350.org</span>, why he would 
not give Trudeau and Notley any credit for Canada's carbon reduction 
policies, he stated a simple fact: that at only two per cent of global 
emissions, what Canada does on the domestic "demand" side to reduce our 
emissions is too small to make any difference. What will make a 
difference, McKibbon continued, is preventing the further development of
 the Canadian oil sands - the third largest reserve on the world. "To 
stop the oil sands, we have to stop all pipelines."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The failure of his <b>social license</b> strategy forced Trudeau to rescue the TransMountain expansion with the $4.5 billion dollar purchase of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada</span>.
 This did not win him many new friends in Alberta or Saskatchewan, but 
infuriated many of his erstwhile climate change supporters in Ontario 
and British Columbia. With an election only a year away, the carbon tax 
issue threatens to push the Liberals even deeper into a political corner
 with no easy way out.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario Premier Doug Ford
 is using his first appearance at a gathering of premiers to assemble a 
national coalition to fight the federal government’s climate plan in 
court, setting up a direct challenge to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less
 than three weeks after his swearing-in, the rookie Progressive 
Conservative Premier has taken his province from a stalwart supporter of
 carbon taxes to a fierce opponent, upsetting the balance on the issue 
that Mr. Trudeau reached with premiers more than two years ago in 
Vancouver. That deal led Ottawa to pass legislation this year that will 
impose a national carbon tax in provinces that have not set up an 
equivalent carbon-pricing regime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ford is scrapping the
 cap-and-trade system his predecessor introduced, and now wants to stop 
Ottawa from imposing a carbon tax on Ontario and other provinces that 
don’t want one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with Saskatchewan, 
which has already promised a legal battle against any federal carbon 
tax, Mr. Ford will court other provincial leaders at the meeting who 
might become allies in a showdown that could end up at the Supreme 
Court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Premier Ford is not 
sitting back on this,” Ontario Environment Minister Rod Phillips said on
 Wednesday. “He’s going to be in New Brunswick, talking to other 
premiers – the meetings are arranged – talking to them about the plan to
 chop this Trudeau carbon tax. It’s important to this country."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manitoba’s Premier told 
The Globe and Mail on Wednesday his province is not interested in 
joining a court fight. Mr. Ford was to meet with Saskatchewan Premier 
Scott Moe on Wednesday evening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s a changing environment,” Mr. Moe said of the provincial political landscape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premiers began arriving 
at a seaside resort in Saint Andrews, N.B., with a wide range of 
pressing issues on their minds in addition to the climate file.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Explainer: Doug Ford Year One: What’s happened so far in the new Ontario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the meeting, 
various premiers said they want to discuss pipelines, federal 
equalization payments, a national pharmacare plan, cannabis 
legalization, immigration and reducing internal trade barriers. But a 
provincial response to the federal climate-change legislation will be 
among the most pressing items on the agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ford government 
expects to table environmental legislation later this summer to repeal 
the cap-and-trade system former Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne 
introduced. During the election campaign, Mr. Ford promised to spend 
$500-million over four years to increase inspections of major polluters,
 invest in new technology and reduce garbage in city parks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saskatchewan launched a 
constitutional challenge earlier this year arguing that the federal 
government does not have jurisdiction to impose a federal carbon price. 
Mr. Ford has indicated he wants to join that case or launch a similar 
one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview with The 
Globe, Mr. Moe said the Ontario election results and recent comments 
from the PEI government questioning Ottawa’s climate plans suggest there
 is growing concern from provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said new carbon taxes 
hurt Canadian businesses at a time when they are concerned about staying
 competitive with the United States, where Washington has cut U.S. taxes
 and imposed tariffs on imports from Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We will have a good 
discussion on competitiveness, including ineffective policies such as 
carbon taxation, of which province after province seems to be coming to 
that realization as the deadlines loom,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Brunswick Premier 
Brian Gallant, the summit host, has not said the province intends to 
challenge Ottawa’s carbon tax plans in court. New Brunswick’s climate 
change plans include using revenue from the province’s existing gasoline
 tax, a move that Environment Minister Catherine McKenna has criticized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">British Columbia, Alberta
 and Quebec remain as large provinces that have already adopted a carbon
 price and support the national plan. However, Quebec’s Liberal 
government is trailing in the polls with an election coming on Oct. 1. 
Alberta Premier Rachel Notley’s NDP government faces a vote early next 
year, and her chief rival, Jason Kenney of the United Conservative 
Party, is a staunch carbon-tax critic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supporters of a national price on carbon have said it would give governments the <b>social license</b> to approve new pipelines, but B.C. and Alberta are bitterly divided over the planned expansion of the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> <b>pipeline</b>, which Ottawa agreed to buy earlier this year in an effort to ensure it goes ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manitoba’s fiscally 
conservative Premier, Brian Pallister, told The Globe he will not join 
Ontario and Saskatchewan in taking Ottawa to court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I know that the federal 
government is very serious about their [carbon-tax] backstop. We got 
constitutional, legal, expert advice that told us they are in their 
realm of authority, and so ‘Just say no’ [to] Trudeau isn’t an answer 
for Manitoba,” Mr. Pallister said. “We’ve designed our own plan. We 
believe our plan will work better.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Phillips made his comments on Wednesday as he hosted his first formal meeting with his federal counterpart, McKenna.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal Environment 
Minister did not pass up an opportunity to take a shot at Ontario’s 
Progressive Conservatives, saying they “don’t seem to have a plan” to 
tackle climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you don’t have a 
climate plan, you also don’t have a plan for the economy,” she said, 
adding later that “I’ve still got to do my job [and I] explained to 
Minister Phillips that we spent a year negotiating a climate plan.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenge for premiers will be to achieve any cohesive decisions by the time the gathering wraps up on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pallister said he’s 
hoping the concern over rising protectionism around the world will push 
the premiers to finally act on eliminating the many trade barriers that 
still exist between provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’ve got a real opportunity here to take barriers down that really shouldn’t have been there,” Mr. Pallister said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a report from Jack Hauen in Toronto.</p>

government. Incorrect information appeared in an earlier version of this

<span class="companylink">Horizon Petroleum</span> Announces NI51-101 Reserves and -2-</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">History and Development Plan</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lachowice field is at
 an early stage of conventional natural gas development. Lachowice-1, 
Lachowice-7 and Stryszawa-2K are the primary wells of interest on the 
field and, despite being essentially vertical in their design and 
utilizing sub-optimal drilling and completion methods for naturally 
fractured formations, tested at rates of up to 5.8 MMcf/d, 8.9 MMcf/d, 
and 2.5 MMcf/d, respectively. Each of these wells was drilled and 
tested, with reservoir depths of 3,000-4,000 meters targeting a 
naturally fractured carbonate reservoir of Middle Devonian age. The 
natural gas is sweet, with up to 91% methane and 7 bbls/MMcf of 
condensate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following receipt of the 
Reserves Report, Horizon is currently in the process of finalizing its 
development plan. In general, it is currently anticipated that the 
development plan would begin with a new vertical well offsetting the 
Lachowice-7 location. Provided Horizon successfully closes the 
Acquisition, it is targeting to drill and test the well in the first 
half of 2019, with first production to occur by late 2019, with natural 
gas sales initially facilities constrained at approximately 3.0 MMcfe/d.
 The wells will produce natural gas under primary drive via the natural 
fractures and the matrix porosity within the reservoir. The project is 
considered pre-development and is expected to cost approximately US$7.5 
million to first production. In a previous press release dated September
 19, 2017, Horizon had stated it was targeting first production from the
 Lachowice field by the second half of 2018. The regulatory process has 
proceeded slower than anticipated, and therefore the conversion of the 
concessions to the new Polish concession laws, and approvals related to 
Horizon taking operatorship of the concessions, has taken longer than 
expected. It is Horizon's understanding that the Polish government is 
currently considering these concessions, and the conversion and 
approvals are expected within the next six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new horizontal or 
highly deviated well and a horizontal or highly deviated re-entry of the
 new vertical well (targeting &gt;300m natural gas column) would be 
drilled in mid-2020, increasing production to 17.5 MMcfe/d at a new 
processing facility expected to be operational in late 2020. Drilling 
would continue with production increases to over 30 MMcfe/d thereafter. 
Operating netbacks are expected to be approximately US$6.80 per Mcfe, 
based on current pricing. Timing of the development is subject to 
regulatory approvals, and Horizon has initiated efforts to begin and 
fast-track the regulatory process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other Assets - France</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In France, the government
 passed a law on December 30, 2017 preventing new oil and natural gas 
licences to be issued, and all production on existing permits to cease 
by 2040. The Company has allowed its Ger licence to expire and has 
applied for a three-year extension on its Ledeuix licence. To the 
Company's knowledge, other companies operating in France have received 
extensions, and as such the Company has no reason to believe that it 
will not receive approval on the extension in 12-18 months. Currently, 
as there is no clarity on timing to first production, the Company will 
initiate the seismic and drilling applications but reduce all 
expenditures in France to minimum levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">C$5 Million Financing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horizon proposes to raise
 up to C$5 million through a private placement, issuing up to 
100,000,000 common shares at a price of $0.05 per share. The net 
proceeds are to be used to close the Acquisition, prepare the assets for
 development and for general corporate purposes. Horizon has entered 
into an engagement agreement with Gneiss Energy Limited, a London, 
United Kingdom based energy-focused advisory practice, for the purposes 
of raising new equity in Europe. In addition, Horizon will raise 
additional funds from Canadian and certain UK investors on a 
non-brokered basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horizon is currently 
examining options for improving the Company's trading liquidity, access 
to new equity capital in Europe and profile alongside its international 
E&amp;P peers. As part of these deliberations, Horizon may consider 
listing on another exchange, such as the <span class="companylink">London Stock Exchange</span>. In the event the Company decides to undertake an additional listing, it expects to execute a plan within the next 6-12 months.</p>

estimates contained in this press release have been prepared in 
accordance with NI 51-101, is dated as of January 31, 2018 and prepared 
by APEX.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reserve and resource 
estimates of natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves provided in 
this news release are estimates only, and there is no guarantee that the
 estimated reserves and/or resources will be recovered. Actual reserves 
and resources may eventually prove to be greater than, or less than, the
 estimates provided herein. It should not be assumed that the estimates 
of future net revenues presented herein represent the fair market value 
of the reserves and/or resources. There are numerous uncertainties 
inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and natural gas liquids
 reserves and/or resources and the future cash flows attributed to such 
reserves and/or resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These risks and 
uncertainties include but are not limited to: (i) the fact that there is
 no certainty that the zones of interest will exist to the extent 
estimated or that the zones will be found to have natural gas with 
characteristics that meet or exceed the minimum criteria in terms of net
 pay thickness and/or porosity, or that the natural gas will be 
commercially recoverable to the extent estimated; (ii) the fact that 
there is no certainty that any portion of the probable reserves and 
contingent and prospective resources will be commercially viable to 
produce; (iii) the fact that the Company must hire an operations team 
and executive team in both Calgary and Poland in order to execute on the
 development plan, and there are no guarantees that suitably qualified 
technical and professional staff and/or consultants will be available; 
(iv) the lack of additional financing to fund the Company's development 
activities and continued operations; (v) the risks associated with 
obtaining approvals to access land to drill wells or install 
infrastructure and facilities in a reasonable time frame; the Polish 
regulatory regime is relatively stable but is marked with long approval 
processes relative to North American jurisdictions; (vi) the risks in 
acquiring or constructing adequate natural gas infrastructure to produce
 and sell natural gas, and whether capacity will be available in the 
existing main <b>pipeline</b> system at reasonable costs; (vii) the risk
 that there may not be a drilling rig available to drill the required 
wells, and the risk that if a rig mobilization is required from outside 
of Poland, that the costs may be prohibitive; (ix) risks inherent in the
 international oil and natural gas industry; (x) fluctuations in foreign
 exchange and interest rates; (xi)the number of competitors in the oil 
and gas industry with greater technical, financial and operations 
resources and staff; (xii) fluctuations in world prices and markets for 
oil and natural gas due to domestic, international, political, social, 
economic and environmental factors beyond the Company's control; (xiii) 
changes in government regulations affecting oil and natural gas 
operations; (xiv) potential liabilities for pollution or hazards against
 which the Company cannot adequately insure or which the Company may 
elect not to insure; (xv) contingencies affecting the classification as 
reserves versus resources which relate to the following issues as 
detailed in the COGE Handbook: ownership considerations, drilling 
requirements, testing requirements, regulatory considerations, 
infrastructure and market considerations, timing of production and 
development, and economic requirements; (xvi) the fact that there is no 
certainty that any portion of the prospective resources will be 
discovered and if discovered, there is no certainty that it will be 
commercially viable to produce any portion of the resources; and (xvii) 
other factors beyond the Company's control.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resources are defined in the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook (COGEH) Volume 1, section 5 as follows:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources are 
those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from known accumulations, but the applied 
projects are not yet considered mature enough for commercial development
 due to one or more contingencies. Contingent Resources may include, for
 example, projects for which there are currently no viable markets, or 
where commercial recovery is dependent on technology under development, 
or where evaluation of the accumulation is insufficient to clearly 
assess commerciality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingencies may include
 factors such as economic, legal, environmental, political, and 
regulatory matters, or a lack of markets. It is also appropriate to 
classify as contingent resources, the estimated discovered recoverable 
quantities associated with a project in the early evaluation stage. 
Contingent Resources are further classified in accordance with the level
 of certainty associated with the estimates and may be sub classified 
based on project maturity and/or characterized by their economic status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all technically 
feasible development plans will be commercial. The commercial viability 
of a development project is dependent on the forecast of fiscal 
conditions over the life of the project. For Contingent Resources, the 
risk component relating to the likelihood that an accumulation will be 
commercially developed is referred to as the "chance of development." 
For contingent resources, the chance of commerciality is equal to the 
chance of development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development Pending are 
contingencies that are being actively pursued; expect resolution in a 
reasonable time period; are directly influenced by the developer with 
both, internal approvals and commitment and development timing and; have
 a high chance of development (&gt;80%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development on Hold are 
contingencies with major non-technical contingencies identified; have a 
reasonable chance of development (&gt;50%); have contingencies that are 
beyond the control of the developer including but not limited to: 
external approvals, economic factors, market access, political factors 
and <b>social license</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development Unclarified 
are contingencies that have not been clearly defined; the project is 
currently under active evaluation; significant further appraisal may be 
required; progress is expected in a reasonable time period; chance of 
development is difficult to assess and could be a big range (20%-80%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development Not Viable 
are contingencies that have been identified; the project was evaluated 
and considered not viable or significant further appraisal may be 
required; progress is not expected in a reasonable time period and; has a
 low chance of development (&lt;&lt;50%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources 
--Development Pending and --Development On Hold are considered economic,
 Contingent Resources --Development Unclarified have economics that are 
undetermined, and Contingent Resources --Development Not Viable are 
considered sub-economic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective Resources are
 those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application 
of future development projects. Prospective resources have both an 
associated chance of discovery and a chance of development. Prospective 
Resources are further subdivided in accordance with the level of 
certainty associated with recoverable estimates assuming their discovery
 and development and may be sub classified based on project maturity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all exploration 
projects will result in discoveries. The chance that an exploration 
project will result in the discovery of petroleum is referred to as the 
"chance of discovery." Thus, for an undiscovered accumulation, the 
chance of commerciality is the product of two risk components -- the 
chance of discovery and the chance of development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estimates of resources 
always involve uncertainty, and the degree of uncertainty can vary 
widely between accumulations/projects and over the life of a project. 
Consequently, estimates of resources should generally be quoted as a 
range according to the level of confidence associated with the 
estimates. An understanding of statistical concepts and terminology is 
essential to understanding the confidence associated with resources 
definitions and categories. These concepts, which apply to all 
categories of resources, are outlined below. The range of uncertainty of
 estimated recoverable volumes may be represented by either 
deterministic scenarios or by a probability distribution. Resources 
should be provided as low, best, and high estimates as follows: </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">   -- Low Estimate and/or 1C in the case of Contingent Resources: This is 
      considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity that will 
      actually be recovered. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities 
      recovered will exceed the low estimate. If probabilistic methods are used, 
      there should be at least a 90 percent probability (P90) that the 
      quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the low estimate. 
 
   -- Best Estimate and/or 2C in the case of Contingent Resources: This is 
      considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will actually be 
      recovered. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities 
      recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate. If 
      probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50 percent 
      probability (P50) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or 
      exceed the best estimate. 
 
   -- High Estimate and/or 3C in the case of Contingent Resources: This is 
      considered to be an optimistic estimate of the quantity that will 
      actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual remaining 
      quantities recovered will exceed the high estimate. If probabilistic 
      methods are used, there should be at least a 10 percent probability (P10) 
      that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the high 
      estimate. </pre>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This approach to 
describing uncertainty may be applied to reserves, contingent resources,
 and prospective resources. There may be significant risk that sub 
commercial and undiscovered accumulations will not achieve commercial 
production, however, it is useful to consider and identify the range of 
potentially recoverable quantities independently of such risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main contingencies 
identified in the Lachowice Reserves Report are the successful 
recompletion of existing abandoned wells, the expected decline rates and
 the approval and completion of new development and new re-entries.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This press release 
contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information 
(collectively "forward-looking information") within the meaning of 
applicable securities laws relating to the Company's plans and other 
aspects of our anticipated future operations, management focus, 
strategies, financial, operating and production results, industry 
conditions, commodity prices and business opportunities. In addition, 
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this press release
 contains forward-looking information regarding anticipated netbacks, 
anticipated potential of the Acquisition, the closing and timing of the 
Acquisition, the timing of the remaining regulatory approvals to close 
the Acquisition, the closing and timing of closing of the Financing, the
 use of proceeds from the Financing, decisions regarding additional 
listings, production guidance, capital program and allocation thereof, 
future production, development and drilling plans, well economics, 
future cost reductions, potential growth, the extension of the Ledeuix 
licence and the current operating plans with respect to the Company's 
assets in Franceas well as the source of funding the Company's capital 
spending. Forward-looking information typically uses words such as 
"anticipate", "believe", "project", "expect", "goal", "plan", "intend" 
or similar words suggesting future outcomes, statements that actions, 
events or conditions "may", "would", "could" or "will" be taken or occur
 in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The forward-looking 
information is based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by
 Horizon's management, including expectations and assumptions noted 
previously in this press release under oil and gas advisories, and in 
addition with respect to prevailing commodity prices and differentials, 
exchange rates, interest rates, applicable royalty rates and tax laws; 
future production rates and estimates of operating costs; performance of
 future wells; reserve and resource volumes; anticipated timing and 
results of capital expenditures; the success obtained in drilling new 
wells; the sufficiency of budgeted capital expenditures in carrying out 
planned activities; the timing, location and extent of future drilling 
operations; the state of the economy and the exploration and production 
business; results of operations; performance; business prospects and 
opportunities; the availability and cost of financing, labour and 
services; the impact of increasing competition; the ability to 
efficiently integrate assets and employees acquired through 
acquisitions, including the Acquisition, the ability to market natural 
gas successfully and Horizon's ability to access capital. Although the 
Company believes that the expectations and assumptions on which such 
forward-looking information is based are reasonable, undue reliance 
should not be placed on the forward-looking information because Horizon 
can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct. Since 
forward-looking information addresses future events and conditions, by 
its very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Horizon's
 actual results, performance or achievement could differ materially from
 those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking information and,
 accordingly, no assurance can be given that any of the events 
anticipated by the forward-looking information will transpire or occur, 
or if any of them do so, what benefits that we will derive therefrom. 
Management has included the above summary of assumptions and risks 
related to forward-looking information provided in this press release in
 order to provide securityholders with a more complete perspective on 
future operations and such information may not be appropriate for other 
purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Readers are cautioned 
that the foregoing lists of factors are not exhaustive. These 
forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this press release
 and we disclaim any intent or obligation to update publicly any 
forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, 
future events or results or otherwise, other than as required by 
applicable securities laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This press release 
contains future-oriented financial information and financial outlook 
information (collectively, "FOFI") about Horizon's prospective results 
of operations, operating netbacks and components thereof, all of which 
are subject to the same assumptions, risk factors, limitations and 
qualifications as set forth in the above paragraphs. FOFI contained in 
this press release was made as of the date of this press release and was
 provided for the purpose of providing further information about 
Horizon's anticipated future business operations. Readers are cautioned 
that the FOFI contained in this press release should not be used for 
purposes other than for which it is disclosed herein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Non-GAAP Measures</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This press release 
includes non-GAAP measures as further described herein. These non-GAAP 
measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by International 
Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS" or, alternatively, "GAAP") and 
therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures
 by other companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operating netbacks are 
determined by deducting royalties, net profit interest, production 
expenses and selling expenses from oil and gas revenue. Operating 
netbacks are per mcfe measures used in operational and capital 
allocation decisions. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre"> 
The assumptions used to generate the netback (US$/Mcfe) in this press release 
are as follows: 
Daily Production(1)                                 17.65 MMcfe/d 
Commodity Revenue (2)                                 US$4.57 MM

Operating Netbacks                                   US$6.82/Mcfe 
 
 
(1) Daily production and operating costs are management's best estimate of the 
production and operating costs from the anticipated wells and is based on all 
of the assumptions outlined in the above paragraphs; (2)Based on Lachowice 
Natural Gas Price = US$8.63/mcf, Condensate Price = US$72.00/Bbl, CAD/USD=

 executed a Letter of Intent with a senior exploration and production 
company (the “LOI”) to settle outstanding litigation and acquire all 
their assets in the St. Lawrence Lowlands, Quebec (the “Lowlands”).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, President and Chief Executive Officer of Questerre, 
commented, “On closing, we will gain operatorship of our acreage in the 
Lowlands. We will be in a much better position to communicate directly 
with municipalities and address local concerns and acceptability. Our 
approach is that good relationships with local communities comes first 
and development second."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, “We will 
continue our step by step approach of working with the government and 
municipalities. This project will proceed by adequately addressing their
 concerns and making sure they participate in the benefits. We are 
confident that, with success, this project will help Quebec greatly 
reduce its hydrocarbon import problem and meet its 2030 energy policy 
targets.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pursuant to the LOI, 
Questerre will acquire the exploration rights to 753,000 net acres in 
the Lowlands, associated wells and equipment, geological and geophysical
 data and other miscellaneous assets. Upon closing of the transaction, 
both parties will release each other from all claims related to the 
outstanding litigation. Other consideration including cash and the 
security required for the assumption of abandonment and reclamation 
liabilities (“A&amp;R Liabilities”) is approximately $16.10 million in 
aggregate. Questerre may post a letter of credit as security for the 
A&amp;R Liabilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Closing of the 
transaction is subject to the enactment by the Ministry of Energy and 
Natural Resources (“Ministry”) in Quebec of the following regulations 
(the “Regulations”): (i) the Regulation Respecting Petroleum 
Exploration, Production and Storage in a body of water; (ii) the 
Regulation Respecting Petroleum Exploration, Production and Storage on 
land; and (iii) the Regulation Respecting Petroleum Exploration, 
Production and Storage Licenses, and <b>Pipeline</b> Construction or Use

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trudeau government's decision to spend $4.5 billion to acquire the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> <b>pipeline</b> must be a wake-up call for Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a sign that we've 
gone too far. Consultations and regulatory processes have become 
disconnected from their initial purposes of informed decision-making. 
Project approvals and permitting are regularly subjected to lengthy 
delays and costly uncertainty that have nothing to do with the 
environment, science, or our economic interests.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've enfeebled our economy as a result. The case of the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b> should bring this into stark clarity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A private company wanted 
to invest $7.5 billion - more than half the federal government's annual 
infrastructure budget - in our country's energy infrastructure. It 
represented a substantial investment involving 15,000 construction jobs 
alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company, by all accounts, followed the rules. It submitted a project application at the end of 2013. The <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>
 recommended its approval in May 2016. The government accepted the 
recommendation - including 157 conditions - in November 2016. <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> spent $1 billion going through the painstaking consultation and regulatory process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet in spite of all 
this the company ultimately decided the project wasn't viable due to 
ongoing policy and legal uncertainty. No other firm would touch it. 
Ottawa had no choice but to buy it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How did we get to a point
 where a private company that abided by the process and sought to invest
 billions of dollars in our country was precluded from doing so? How did
 we get to a point where public capital needed to replace private 
capital to finance a profitable project? This isn't a nascent industry. 
It isn't a case of market failure. We already have 840,000 kilometres of
 <b>pipeline</b> operating in Canada. Most has been financed and constructed by private capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a case of 
government failure. In fact, it's a failure by all of us. We've 
permitted a build up of government rules and processes that amounts to 
what conservative columnist George Will calls "economic enfeeblement."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trudeau government 
certainly contributed to the problem. Opportunistic critiques of the 
major project review process diminished public confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vague commitments about 
the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People raised
 the spectre of a First Nations "veto". New regulatory burdens 
exacerbated the already slow and cumbersome process. Notions of "<b>social license</b>" were predictably used as a foil by ideological activists to stall progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is all true. But the problem is bigger than one government, one <b>pipeline</b>, or one sector. It now permeates every level of government and crosses the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One example: Condo and 
real estate developers in Toronto typically face nearly a 
year-and-a-half for approvals and spend an average of $46,570 per unit 
on compliance costs. The result is less housing supply and in turn 
higher prices at a time when people are rightly concerned about housing 
affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another example: federal,
 provincial, and local governments pledged funding for the Spadina 
subway extension in 2006 and yet the service only commenced more than 10
 years later in December 2017 following various delays and cost 
overruns. No wonder it represented the first new subway stops in 
decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The list could go on and on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trans Mountain episode is merely the most recent and highest profile example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It should cause us to 
restore common sense to government decision-making and project reviews. 
It's time to end the enfeeblement. We need to start building things 
again.</p>

 - To understand the counterintuitive political calculus behind Justin 
Trudeau's controversial decision to buy the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b>,
 one has to go back to the fundamental equation that has governed this 
prime minister's energy and climate change policies since his days in 
opposition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That Trudeau had no choice but to take over the <b>pipeline</b>
 if he wanted to ensure that the plan for its expansion did not die on 
the drawing board is not in question. By the time Finance Minister Bill 
Morneau announced the federal decision Tuesday, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> - the <b>pipeline</b>'s parent company - was about to pull the plug on the project.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But
 the real question is why would the Liberal government be willing to put
 an open-ended amount of political and financial capital on the line to 
keep it alive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If one connects the dots 
between most major policies that past governments have deemed to be in 
the national interest, one almost always finds they conveniently 
intersected with a ruling party's election prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Stephen Harper's decision to bail out the auto industry in 2009 was not 
unrelated to the fact that his path to a coveted majority government ran
 through Ontario. His conversion to deficit financing at the time of the
 global economic crisis was a deathbed one, at least in part dictated by
 the need to survive confidence votes in the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by that measure, Trudeau's Trans Mountain move is an outlier. The electoral math does not add up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the face of it, the 
prime minister has at best shored up half a dozen Liberal seats in the 
Prairies at the cost of potentially putting in play at least triple that
 number across the country. Along the way, Trudeau has put himself on a 
collision course with many Indigenous constituencies, and he has 
destroyed his international reputation as a climate change crusader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the stakes, the prime minister's <b>pipeline</b>
 gamble has even been compared to Brian Mulroney's decision to roll the 
dice in his relentless quest for constitutional reconciliation with 
Quebec in the early 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mulroney had a 
compelling incentive to stick with the constitutional file to the bitter
 end. After the Meech Lake accord failed, he could not have let it go 
without risking his governing majority as the result of defections to 
the nascent Bloc Québécois and without fuelling support for Quebec 
secession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is an economic case to be made for ensuring the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b>
 is completed. Of the projects designed to link the Alberta oilfields to
 tidewater that were on the drawing board when Trudeau became prime 
minister, it is the only one that is still actively pursued. Until the 
last B.C. election, it was also considered the most likely to get to 
completion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Trans Mountain 
expansion has also become as politically indispensable to Trudeau's 
agenda - at least in the mind of its Liberal overseers - as it may be to
 Canada's oil industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was always meant to be
 the poster project for the federal contention that it is possible to 
balance Canada's energy ambitions with a more aggressive approach to 
mitigating climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Trudeau came to 
power, the emphasis has been the part of the equation that involves 
putting a price on carbon pollution as a necessary step to earn a <b>social license</b> for a <b>pipeline</b> projects such as Trans Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Liberal government believes the flipside of the equation - that a <b>social license</b> for a carbon tax cannot be sustained if it is earned on the back of Alberta's energy industry - to be just as essential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allowing the Trans 
Mountain expansion to die this week would have cost Trudeau the support 
of Alberta's NDP government for his national climate change framework. 
Back in March, Premier Rachel Notley tied meeting Ottawa's carbon tax 
targets to the future of the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking to next year's 
federal election, the demise of the Trans Mountain expansion would have 
meant giving opponents of Trudeau's carbon pricing strategy - starting 
with the federal Conservatives - a prime exhibit in their prosecution of
 the havoc they argue his policy will wreak on the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As so it is that while 
Trudeau is widely portrayed as having picked the polluters' side in the 
climate change debate, the Liberals will argue that they have done what 
they needed to do to continue to advance a pro-environment agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only time will tell 
whether this government has trapped itself in an intricate web of 
twisted logic. If so, as of this week's Trans Mountain announcement 
Trudeau is unlikely to untangle himself from that web in time for next 
year's election.</p>

Sunday[https://www-theglobeandmail-com.ezproxy.lib.ucalgary.ca/business/article-quebec-indigenous-chiefs-hundreds-of-activists-stage-kinder-morgan/].
 Since early March, more than 200 people, young and old, have been

 Behind them stand over twenty thousand Coast

Indigenous-led movement that has already stopped the Northern Gateway

that Indigenous people hold Title and Rights. Trudeau's false assurances
 are not fooling anyone, and Canadians are well aware that he has placed
 liability onto everyone in this country. <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> got our message that without consent of the many Nations along its path, the <b>pipeline</b>
 would not be built - now it's time for the Trudeau government to get 
the message," said Chief Judy Wilson, Neskonlith, Secwepemc Nation, and 
Secretary-Treasurer of the Union of BC Indian Chiefs (UBCIC).</p>

 Six have filed legal challenges to the project. In addition, 150

opposition to the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> <b>pipeline</b> and all other attempts at allowing even more tar sands production, including Enbridge's Line 3 and <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s Keystone XL pipelines.</p>

 it wasn't so darn important to our city, there'd be some degree of smug
 satisfaction with the awkward position in which both the premier and 
prime minister now find themselves embroiled in with this whole <b>pipeline</b> brouhaha.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, it was Premier
 Rachel Notley, when ensconced in opposition with barely a thought of 
ever getting the top job, who would regale the then-ruling Tories about 
the urgent need to wean the province off the endless energy 
rollercoaster.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And
 it was Prime Minister Justin Trudeau who once campaigned on a platform 
promising Indigenous groups and environmentalists there'd be a new dawn 
in Canada under his steel-eyed steerage, which would ensure the age of 
dastardly Big Oil would melt faster than any 21st century Arctic 
glacier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, Notley is now 
desperately clinging to that same disparaged roller-coaster with a 
white-knuckled fervour unmatched in modern-day Alberta politics. If it 
doesn't quickly kick into gear and help reduce the recession still 
lingering in Calgary, then the only coasting her party will do is into 
the Prairie political history dustbin this time next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, those Grits in
 Ottawa might as well be wording a help wanted ad aimed at anyone with a
 big shovel and broad back daft enough to try their hand at building a <b>pipeline</b> in this hopelessly divided country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reap what you sow springs to mind at this complete and utter farce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley set the scene in the early days of her premiership with all that long-since ditched blather about <b>social license</b>.
 Believing that the rest of Canada consisted of scrupulously fair folk 
without an ounce of self-interest, we were treated to the strange 
spectacle of marauding bands of ardent light bulb changing missionaries 
saving us from environmental Armageddon whether we liked it or not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that was then; this 
is now. (Though, to be honest, I've not noticed any real change in my 
monthly power bill since getting the blessed bulbs, other than the 
notorious carbon charge.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certainly, there's been 
no change either among many in the rest of Canada, despite our 
self-imposed emissions cap and carbon levy. Yep, they're quietly 
continuing to enjoy the fruits of those extra taxes Alberta generates, 
while merrily complaining we're turning the planet into some big black 
blob.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there's the prime minister, who happily stuck a stake through Enbridge's planned $7.9-billion Northern Gateway <b>pipeline</b> to Kitimat in B.C., while allowing his government to disparage the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span> and let a bunch of loudmouths, grandstanders and liars destroy <span class="companylink">TransCanada Corp</span>.'s $16-billion Energy East project aimed at shipping Alberta crude to New Brunswick refineries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just like Notley, he believed in this <b>social license</b> silliness. In Trudeau's case, he no doubt expected the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b> expansion to get a relatively easy passage as a type of payback for his government's success in screwing up the other national <b>pipeline</b> projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As we all now know, it didn't quite work out that way. So now the federal government is on bended knee to <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>,
 promising no doubt some huge taxpayer-funded payoff if the company 
agrees to continue putting up with the relentless sticks and stones of 
protest in B.C. and actually completes the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if they pull out as 
they have threatened to do at the end of this month? Well, according to 
federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau, there are other outfits that 
could step in to finish the job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, pray tell, who could they be? Maybe Morneau is thinking of those experienced Canadian <b>pipeline</b> builders. Yes, <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> and Enbridge - the same ones the Grits skewered a year or so ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And what would their 
reaction be, we wonder? Hold on a moment, folks. Can anyone else hear a 
strange, almost maniacal laughter emanating from those downtown Calgary 
office towers? Chris Nelson is a Calgary writer.</p>

 The midweek break week strategists don't join us nearly often enough, 
but they're here today. Sarah Bain is with Hill+Knowlton. And there's 
our happy couple in Toronto. Robin Sears, who is with Earnscliffe 
Strategy Group; Jason Lietaer, who is with Enterprise Canada. Nice to 
have you all here. I want to quickly talk about this <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 announcement today, guys, and Sarah. Is it smart to, sort of, sort of 
float the idea that you'll backstop losses without taking an equity 
position, and frankly, is it wise to say you'll invest in a project that
 they say is already pretty viable on its own? What do you make of this,
 Robin?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ROBIN
 SEARS (Earnscliffe Strategy Group): I was thinking Peter Lougheed would
 be spinning in his grave, Don, because this is the sort of play where 
he would have insisted on an equity stake. Insisted on a hard number and
 a commitment of what that would mean. Instead, we've got this quote, 
indemnification for amounts of money that range from millions to 
billions, and unknown. I don't think it solves anything. I think it's 
just kicking the can again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Hmm. Jason?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JASON LIETAER (Enterprise
 Canada): I mean, this is, there's that old poker saying, you know, when
 you look around the table and you can't find the sucker, the sucker's 
you. And I've got to say, I don't know what the <span class="companylink">government of Canada</span>
 has been doing on this for the last number of, they've backed 
themselves into this weird corner. You know, Stephen Harper would've 
gone to, gone to Houston and negotiated, negotiated a, we're going to 
give you, you know, hundreds of millions or a billion dollars to build a
 <b>pipeline</b> that you're going to make money for with nothing in 
return, I think you would have been laughed out of the place, and you 
know, they've, they've taken all the other options on the table, they've
 backed themselves into this corner. They've finally figured out it's in
 the national interest, and now they're a desperate government trying to
 do what its, what they can to, to save it. And I just, I don't know 
what they're doing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Wow! The reviews are lukewarm here, Sarah...</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SARAH BAIN (Hill+Knowlton Ottawa): Wow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: I would say, to 
understate. I mean, some people would argue it's a smart position not to
 buy in, but on the other hand, what are we getting for this?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAIN: Right. Well, I 
think today is announcement obviously was because of the shareholder 
meeting and this is an effort by the government to show clearly to 
shareholders that they are committed to having this project move 
forward. By indicating today that one of the concerns, obviously very 
clear concerns that the company and the shareholders have is that 
there's risk involved. That necessarily doesn't exist for other projects
 because you have a <b>social license</b> that's required. You have 
governments that are sparring on this. So you, the government is simply 
indicating to this company, you are concerned about the risk, we are 
providing a guarantee so that that risk can be removed, that political 
risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEARS: Yeah but, what, 
what have they made clear, Sarah? They haven't made anything clear to 
the government, to the shareholders of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>.
 All they've said to them is we'll indemnify you, indemnify you against 
Point Grey grandmothers lying in front of bulldozers for two years? I 
mean, there is no such guarantee that can be offered apart from making 
this a federal public project, and they're refusing to do that...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAIN: Well, it's an insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEARS: They're refusing to invest. It's not insurance. It's just words.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAIN: It is, absolutely. 
It's indicating to, their commitment to a project by indicating that 
they will remove that risk. It's very simple.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEARS: Good luck. Good luck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LIETAER: You know, you know, yeah, good, good luck. Good luck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: I don't think Jason thinks it's that simple.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LIETAER: Well, I just, 
you know, when Trudeau, you know, walked around the country for the last
 couple years saying if you just believe me with my carbon tax, if you 
just send me into Alberta and BC, I'll be able to get all these 
pipelines built. And here he is, he's got to buy it for a billion 
dollars? I mean, I just...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAIN: Jason, the previous government had no luck getting any.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LIETAER: Yeah. I think 
Keystone, the Alberta Clipper, Line 9 reversal, there's tons of 
pipelines that were built under the last guy. This guy hasn't built an 
inch. So, just to turn it around on you, I don't see it happening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEARS: I don't either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Okay. I want to 
move, I want to move on because there's some other juicy topics here. I 
want to start, we'll stick with sort of Alberta issues. Jason Kenney, we
 all know him, former federal cabinet minister and now he's the official
 leader of the official opposition in Alberta. Man, he unleashed in the 
"Calgary Sun," he gave them a bunch of quotes about Justin Trudeau. I'll
 just put the comments up here. He says, he's talking about Justin 
Trudeau, he says: "This guy was my critic in opposition for three years.
 I don't think he has the foggiest idea what's going on. I know Justin. 
He doesn't have a clue what he's doing. This guy's an empty trust fund 
millionaire who has the political depth of a finger bowl. He can't read a
 briefing note longer than a cocktail napkin." Now, I, I've heard a lot 
of slam dunks on rival politicians before. That's got to be the most 
acerbic. What do you make of that, Jason? I mean...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: I mean, should Jason Kenney not be toning it down a little bit? He might have to work with this prime minister one day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LIETAER: I thought he was pretty measured, Don. I thought that he was pretty restrained there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAIN: Jason!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LIETAER: No, I'm joking. 
You know, the problem, the problem that, you know, the issue here is Mr.
 Kenney, who's at 50 or 60 percent in Alberta is running against a 
politician, Mr. Trudeau, who' at a, you know, slightly less popular than
 Kathleen Wynne is in Ontario. So, you know, it's, you know, the truth 
is, this kind of politics will work. He's probably going to have to tone
 it down a little bit. I mean, that was probably as hot as you're going 
to see it and I know Robin and Sarah won't like it very much but I've 
got to say, politics works and the Trudeau name in Alberta these days, 
he's not winning any more seats in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Oh, man, I 
tweeted it and it's been getting re-tweeted like a madman. I mean, 
Robin, really, is this not a little over the top?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEARS: Well, the funny thing about Mr. Kenney is he used to talk that way in private about Mr. Harper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEARS: I mean, he has a 
rather delusional, self-importance for a politician who thinks that he 
can say anything about anybody and it won't come around and bite him. 
No, it's vulgar. It's silly and it reflects, I'm afraid the kind of guy 
he is, for whom truth has never been his best friend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Hmm. I'm not sure Justin Trudeau will easily forget that one, but maybe he will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAIN: Well, I, I think 
there are parts of both of what Robin and Jason have said that I want to
 emphasize. I think Jason is right in saying that the...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Jason Kenney's right?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAIN: No, our Jason! Our Jason, on the panel...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: All right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAIN: ...is right in 
saying that this is certainly a tactic I think to attack his opponent 
here that he thinks is going to help him get into the premier's office, 
is actually the prime minister, and it's never hurt any candidates in 
Alberta to attack the prime minister...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Absolutely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAIN: ...in our country. 
So I think that's a reasonable tactic. But this is a former colleague of
 his. This is the prime minister, the sitting prime minister. It is 
completely inappropriate and disrespectful to speak about him, or 
anyone, in that way. And on this panel, we absolutely attack each other 
on our policies but never the people, and I think that he's gone, I 
can't even understand what would have motivated him to go this far. I 
know, obviously he said it, I believe he meant it, and I don't think 
he's going to apologize for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LIETAER: Just for what 
it's worth, just for what it's worth, Don, some of the things that 
Liberals and others say about Jason Kenney both publicly and privately, I
 don't think, you know, some of that will strip the paint off the walls 
as well. So, you know, it goes both ways on this one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEARS: Yeah, but there's one difference, Jason. Private is not public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAIN: We have an actual example of someone who has said something.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Final topic, 
Justin Trudeau, we just saw Kevin's report about, he's in New York, but 
he's also down there, I guess, to sort of try and whip up support for <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>. This is his 16th trip to sell <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>
 in the States, ten since Trump became president. There's a bit of an 
unofficial deadline tomorrow. And I guess I'm wondering, has Trudeau put
 maybe too much skin in the game himself on this one. Is the success of <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> now an imperative for him politically, or will he be able to get away from this if <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> falls apart without too much damage to his reputation? Robin, what do you think?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEARS: There are not many
 foreign policy files in which I give the Liberals much credit, but this
 is one of them. They have managed the <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>
 file, I think, with exceptional strength and wisdom by bringing all 
kinds of Canadians, from Rona Ambrose to Jerry Dias to all kinds of 
business leaders into the tent to help them do this. So if it fails, 
they can say, we did everything. We pulled out all the stops, and still,
 it failed. If it succeeds, they'll get the credit for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LIETAER: I'm going to say
 that (inaudible) you know that I agree with what Robin just said. So, 
I'm going to spend a little bit of time talking instead about Trudeau's,
 you know, sort of, laugher at this speech about how we've got to listen
 to some of our opponents and we've got to, you know, take the other 
side and all this kind of stuff. I didn't understand a word that he was 
saying, given the tone of the discourse coming out of the PMO over the 
last little bit, and how that they, they basically, all their enemies, 
they've, they laughed at them. I will say this, the <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> file, they've done a very good job, and I agree with Robin. If it fails, it's on Trump, not on Trudeau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: All right. I'm 
going to actually talk about what you're referring to there a bit later 
with our journalists, Jason. Last word to you, Sarah.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAIN: Well, I agree with my colleagues on the panel...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: I know. They're saying nice things about you. I guess you do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAIN: I agree with them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: But tomorrow, we could be in trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAIN: I would say that 
one of the things that's really important to the Trump government is not
 only to be heard, but to be seen, and I think the fact that the prime 
minister has been going regularly is a clear indication of the 
commitment that he has to this, this agreement, and the prime minister 
speaking to Mr. Trump regularly. On the other side of it, I think it's 
really interesting, and certainly a point of pride for myself, that our 
prime minister gets invited to events like this at <span class="companylink">NYU</span> and to, you know, 10,000 plus individuals at the Yankee stadium. It's a pretty big deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Well, that is a 
heckuva segue, but let's talk about Wayne Easter. He basically said that
 all this talk, he's an MP and he's on the parliamentary group. He says 
this whole idea of sunset clauses is stupid. That's not exactly a nice 
set-up to tomorrow's, sort of, unofficial deadline, is it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAIN: Well, I would 
simply say that I have not seen those comments, but he is not part of 
the negotiating team. Not in Washington right now. So I am certain that 
he will have some explaining to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Okay. All right. 
We'll leave it at that. Thank you, everybody. We will see you the next 
break week. It's still not too, still a little ways away, but we would 
like to get you back as soon as we can.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEARS: Thanks, Don.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LIETAER: Thanks very much. Thanks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: All right, coming up, the North Korea shuffle leaves Donald Trump in limbo. Please stay with us.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As
 a Canadian visiting Ottawa - in a nod to our selfie-friendly Prime 
Minister - have you ever taken a photo on Parliament Hill at the 
Centennial Flame? For shame. You might have missed the opportunity. The 
federal government has now taken its fine-toothed climate comb to that 
Centennial Flame by studying options to cut the natural gas and 
extinguish the flame to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. In the 
meantime, Ottawa is spending $20,000 tax dollars every year to purchase 
carbon offsets for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a bit silly. As the 
developing world is dramatically ramping up its demand for fossil fuels 
thanks to undeniably positive progress, Canada is looking at ways to 
turn a small flame into a LED light bulb.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's
 the latest move in the federal government's fourpronged climate plan: 
first, collect and spend more money; second, make life less enjoyable 
for Canadians; third, ensure politicians like Justin Trudeau and 
activists like David Suzuki carry on their carbon-intensive lifestyles; 
and fourth, look mildly ridiculous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If our politicians want 
to give the illusion that they're saving the planet with symbolic 
gestures, how about starting with themselves? Stop taking international 
flights to meetings discussing why people should take fewer 
international flights. Perhaps Face-Time the Aga Khan instead of flying 
all the way to his private island. Live a little less high on the hog. 
But their hypocrisy knows no bounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At present, Prime 
Minister Trudeau is still flying all over the world for luxury 
vacations. Minister of Environment and Climate Change Catherine McKenna 
tweets often about jetting off to climate meetings with groups of people
 who have evidently never heard of Skype. Carbon taxing premiers and 
provincial ministers are no better. And how many homes does Suzuki own? 
Politicians and bureaucrats are shuttled around using a lot of energy. 
Those trips are taxpayer-funded, so regular Canadians foot the bill 
twice - once on their own travel costs and again for the increased 
travel costs of the government class.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To what end? Those who 
supported Justin Trudeau's carbon tax schemes, hoping for tangible 
returns - via the intangible so-called <b>social license</b> - must surely be frustrated with the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain <b>Pipeline</b>
 expansion. The project got a technical go-ahead from the federal 
government a year and a half ago, yet is at a total stand-still. It 
failed to win <b>social license</b> with British Columbia gatekeepers, 
despite Albertans swallowing the carbon tax for nearly 18 months and the
 Trudeau government promising to punish all Canadians with the same tax 
grab.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Social license</b> has
 always been a false bill of goods, but it convinced some in the oil and
 gas industry that they first must be punished to achieve progress. 
(How's that working out?) Thankfully, fewer Canadians will be forced to 
stomach this political hypocrisy as the provincial defense against 
Trudeau's $35-billion annual carbon tax is mounting. Saskatchewan is 
taking the federal government to court and Manitoba's premier says he'll
 do the same, Atlantic provinces are not moving closer to carbon taxes, 
and polls show anti-carbon tax political leaders are likely to win the 
next elections in Ontario and Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign demand for fossil
 fuels makes carbon dioxide taxes here essentially pointless - unless 
you agree shipping jobs to China is a good way to lower Canada's CO2 
emissions. But if our politicians are so convinced that changing 
Canadian behaviour is the key to saving the world, the least they could 
do is lead by example. Until they do, their scolding will be 
hypocritical and their gestures will be silly at best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the day comes when the
 carbon tax is imposed on all Canadians by a heavyhanded federal 
government, take heart: together, we can gather 'round the Centennial 
LED, partaking collectively in one very long eye roll - or to ensure we 
keep warm, perhaps a louder political protest.</p>

 easy to miss amid the understandable political uproar over Canadian 
pipelines (or perhaps more appropriately, our apparent inability to 
build them) was the <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span> Monthly Merchandise Trade Report in February that tracks Canada's international balance of trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report indicated 
Canada's trade deficit amounted to $2.7 billion, which widened from $1.9
 billion from the prior month, with imports advancing 1.9 per cent 
month-over-month, mostly due to higher purchases of energy products.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hidden
 within those summary numbers was the revelation that imports of energy 
products into Canada advanced by a material 15.4 per cent to $3.4 
billion, the highest level since November 2014, with the largest share 
of those imports originating from the U.S. The importation of crude oil 
and bitumen advanced 15.4 per cent, with imported refined petroleum 
products up by 24.1 per cent, the latter due largely to increased 
imports of gasoline into British Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's increased importation of oil and its products reflects a growing trend in the past two years. In December 2015, the <span class="companylink">U.S. Congress</span> ended a 40-year ban on oil exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accompanied by surging 
U.S. production, crude oil exports from the U.S. to Canada (seasonally 
adjusted), have risen from $6.4 billion from September 2015 to February 
2016, to $8.4 billion from September 2017 to February of this year, or 
by about a third.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While these numbers 
fluctuate monthly, the point is that in February, while Canada exported 
$8.8 billion in energy, it also imported $3.38 billion from 
international sources which, according to <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span>, represents a year-to-year increase of 12.3 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada produces far more 
oil than it can consume, and hence it is the world's fourth largest 
producer and third largest exporter of oil. In 2016, Canada was the 
largest foreign supplier of crude oil to the U.S., with 99 per cent of 
our oil exports directed there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada accounted for 41 per cent of total U.S. crude oil imports and 20 per cent of U.S. refinery crude oil intake. However, <span class="companylink">Natural Resources Canada</span>
 also indicated that in 2016, Canada imported crude oil and equivalents 
from many countries, including the United States (62 per cent), Saudi 
Arabia, Algeria, Nigeria and Norway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when Canadian attentions, both public and political, are riveted on our pernicious lack of <b>pipeline</b>
 access to international oil markets, we question why so little 
attention is being paid to Canada's increasing importation of petroleum 
products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It cost Canadians $3.4 
billion in February alone. To be clear, we are not arguing that a trade 
surplus or deficit is an appropriate barometer of a country's health. 
However, we do suggest that growing U.S. exports, due to deregulation, 
and our inability to build infrastructure to export our energy, is not 
beneficial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada could enhance its 
security of supply, reduce its trade deficit and produce fewer global 
greenhouse gas emissions if we used more of our Canadian crude oil 
production. A recent study by the <span class="companylink">Canadian Energy Research Institute</span>,
 using 2016 data, indicates that substituting Canadian oil wherever 
possible using space on existing pipelines, railcars and ocean tankers, 
could reduce foreign oil imports into Eastern Canada by a whopping 47 
per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This would save 
refineries $210 million and reduce Canadian emissions of carbon dioxide 
by the equivalent of more than two million tonnes, or about 5.7 per cent
 annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute also found 
that eastern Canadian refineries process just over one million barrels 
of oil per day, of which only 39 per cent originates from Western Canada
 and five per cent originates from the eastern Canadian offshore; fully 
56 per cent is imported from the United States (amounting to 260,000 
barrels of imported oil per day).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly, lower regulatory and fiscal costs would benefit all Canadians. Hence, we urgently need better policies to resolve our <b>pipeline</b> infrastructure problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a precarious B.C. 
government opposes oil pipelines, the Trudeau government's avowed 
transition away from fossil fuels appears to be directed solely at 
penalizing Canadian producers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is over-regulating
 domestic producers with misdirected policies that allow foreign 
petroleum imports - unimpeded by Canadian environmental laws, so-called <b>social license</b>,
 greenhouse gas reduction strategies and associated taxes - to flood 
into Canada to displace jobs and discourage investment. Ron Wallace has

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It affects us immensely."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Viersen, 
alternatives for oil transportation such as railways should be ruled out
 due to the increased danger and inefficiency. Using railways also takes
 up space that could be used for other products, such as grain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's just very expensive
 to ship oil by other processes other than by pipelines," Viersen said. 
"When we already have a discounted oil price, to then have to put that 
extra cost on it just makes it a nonstarter for oil companies."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Viersen explained that less exploration leads to less people in the area, which negatively affects the local economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He noted that the region had a high of 1,800 drilling rigs in 2013, but now has only around half that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Just that alone means there's thousands of people not working," Viersen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> recently announced it would suspend work on the Trans Mountain <b>Pipeline</b> expansion after pushback from British Columbia and environmental activists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Since Prime Minister 
Justin Trudeau has taken power, we've seen Northern Gateway get 
cancelled, we've seen the Energy East project get cancelled as well, and
 now we're look at Trans Mountain, which is probably the last major <b>pipeline</b> project that was in the cue," Viersen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also noted how the carbon tax was supposed to give Alberta "<b>social license</b>" for the building of more pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've been underneath 
the weight of a significant carbon tax before many of the other 
provinces and it doesn't seem to be helping," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Viersen said 
conservatives, including himself, are now calling on Trudeau to take 
action and convince the opposition to allow more <b>pipeline</b> projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's his job to convince
 these folks that these projects are in the national interest," Viersen 
said. "Coming from Alberta, all of us live on top of pipelines-steel

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EVAN SOLOMON: Well the <b>pipeline</b> is in limbo. British Columbia has turned to the court to find out if they have the power to stop the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> <b>pipeline</b>.
 And guess what? They say it's highly unlikely their court challenge 
will get a decision before the May 31st deadline, which is the deadline <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> has set to pull the plug on the <b>pipeline</b>. Coincidence? Not sure. The federal government still insists though that the <b>pipeline</b>
 will get built. The question is how will they do it? But here's the 
twist. They now have a summer jobs program, and the federal government 
will be providing an environmental group with money that will be used to
 stop the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b> from ever getting built. Is 
this just a case of free speech, or is it a sign that the federal 
government isn't really behind this project at all? Joining me now to 
talk about that and more, the Conservative leader Andrew Scheer. Good to
 have you here, sir.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
ANDREW SCHEER (Conservative Leader): Great to be on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: What do you 
think of, if you were the federal government, if you're the prime 
minister right now, what would you do? What would the response be to 
BC's reference to their superior court? SCHEER: Well if I could just put
 this in context a little bit, because we have to understand why the May
 31st deadline is so important. It's important because the confidence in
 our energy sector has been shattered. The ban on tanker traffic, 
killing Northern Gateway, the Liberals killed Energy East, the carbon 
tax, now bill C-69. So the government needed to not do things months 
ago. We called on Justin Trudeau to meet with Premier Horgan in January 
and February. They only met a couple of weeks ago. So they've been so 
late to this game. We need a federal government that's going to stand up
 for federal jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: How though? 
SCHEER: Well there are tools at the government's disposal to ensure that
 this project can get built by declaring it in the national interest, by
 ensuring that other aspects around the <b>pipeline</b> cannot be used...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Okay, one of the
 big things is, and Jason Kenney has talking about this, stop transfers 
to BC to force their hand. Would you support that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: I think when 
we're talking about levels of action like that, we're kind of losing the
 big picture, which is that we shouldn't have a government that has to 
punish the people of a province because they failed to take leadership 
for months. When you look at why <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 is saying this, they're not saying this because there is something 
magic happens on May 31st. They're saying this because there's no signal
 that this federal government is going to champion...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: But how do they give signal?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: Repeal C-69, 
scrap the carbon tax, lift the tanker ban which would allow Northern 
Gateway to be built, invite Energy East back to the table. That would 
all send confidence to say, okay, we may have an issue with the 
premier... SOLOMON: But how would that, but how would stopping a price 
on carbon in anyway do anything for a <b>pipeline</b>?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: Because right now
 what's happening is people around the world understand that under 
Justin Trudeau there will not be new pipelines built, that there will 
not be new big energy projects built because of all these other things. 
If we had a federal government that was sending the signal that Canada 
was a place that you can do business in, then they would say, okay, 
we'll wait out the British Columbia court decision because we have all 
these other things that give us confidence that we can get a successful <b>pipeline</b> built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: To be fair, 
through, first of all linking the price on carbon, I do not see the link
 there, but let's just... SCHEER: It's a huge cost to the energy sector.
 It's another cost that makes them less effective, less competitive 
versus other countries. SOLOMON: Does it bother you that, because you 
campaigned against a price on carbon a lot, that BC which has had a 
price on carbon, Quebec now, Ontario, and Alberta, those have all been, I
 mean BC and Ontario, the fastest, and Quebec, the fastest growing 
economies. The price on carbon, in fact according to Eco Fiscal 
Commission, has not hurt those economies, it's helped those economies. 
Those are the fastest growing economies. In other words, the link 
between a price on carbon and hurting the economy is not there. What do 
you say to that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: Well I believe 
absolutely it has hurt Canadian families in those provinces. I don't 
support a carbon tax. I'll leave it up to voters in individual provinces
 to decide what they want their provincial government to do. I do not 
believe that the federal government should impose a carbon tax. I will 
repeal the Liberal carbon tax. SOLOMON: And people will say to you, all 
right Andrew Scheer, you don't like that, what will you do about climate
 change to reduce carbon? Anything? Do you have a plan?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: Well exactly. And
 the Liberals would love to have people believe that the choice is a 
carbon tax or nothing. I reject that. The previous Conservative 
government took real steps to lower emissions working with industry, 
finding way to incentivize efficiencies in terms of emitting into the 
atmosphere. The Liberals...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: You're not even 
close to reaching your own target to be fair. SCHEER: The Liberals 
signed on to the exact same targets that we had. We will be unveiling a 
very detailed and comprehensive plan, because we believe that Canada has
 to be part of the solution. We're about a year away from the next 
selection, a little bit more, I guarantee you we will have a 
comprehensive message to Canadians that doesn't just focus in on...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: That will reach,
 I'm just asking because you know this is a big issue, because it ties 
in with pipelines as you said, the former Harper regulations would not 
come close to meeting this, the targets that the Harper government set, 
and you want to keep those. Will you unveil a plan that will actually 
meet the Paris targets?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: Of course I will 
unveil a plan that reaches the targets that we have already voted in 
favour of. We believe that Canada has to be part of the solution. We 
want to have, we will, we will have a meaningful plan to reduce 
emissions and that will also tackle other major environmental issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Let's talk about
 the summer jobs program, been pretty controversial. The federal 
government has this plan where they say you can apply, you can get money
 to support an intern, but you have to, if you're a group that in anyway
 shape or form opposes pro choice and their views on reproduction, they 
have to have an attestation that you cannot use any of the money for 
that. Many religious groups say, no way, it's against our principles. 
Now we, so Bible camps in Alberta are not getting any money, they are 
not eligible. In the meantime, an advocacy group called Dogwood, which 
is specifically going to use the money to oppose the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b>, got the money. Is it hypocrisy, or is it something that you have defended, free speech?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: It's complete 
hypocrisy because it's not quite, as you led into it, the Liberal 
attestation was not required solely for groups that were involved in 
advocacy, it was obligatory for everybody. If you were trying to hire 
someone to work in a rural museum, they had to sign on to that 
attestation. A local municipality, the town administrator would have to 
sign that attestation. So what they were doing was forcing people to 
believe the same thing that Justin Trudeau believed to hire a summer 
student to do anything. Now here we have a situation where, in British 
Columbia, an organization is using the funding to specifically organize 
protests, to advocate, to block a project that is in the national 
interest. So this Liberal government is taking tax dollars from people 
who have lost their jobs in the energy sector and giving it to a group 
of people...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Do you think they shouldn't give it to Dogwood?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: I don't believe 
that, I believe that we need to have a look at this program and say why 
is the federal government funding advocacy groups? You know advocacy 
groups are free to raise money on their own. SOLOMON: Do you think they 
should fund religious groups? What's the difference? I'm just trying, my
 confusion on this is the Conservative government didn't want to fund 
groups like <span class="companylink">Planned Parenthood</span> because 
they used reproductive issues as a litmus test for funding, as the 
Liberals have, okay? So both Conservatives and Liberals have used this 
issue as a litmus test. Then, on the other side though, there is not a 
litmus test for other groups, and that's what I don't understand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: We've never 
argued the point that the government doesn't have the right to choose 
what types of activities are funded. We just said the government 
shouldn't force a view on your, peer inside your conscience and dictate 
what you should...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: But on reproductive issues, the Conservative government would pull funding, as had the Liberals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: We never forced people to take a position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: On maternal health you wouldn't fund groups like <span class="companylink">Planned Parenthood</span>. You know that. And by the way, the Conservatives funded Dogwood, right. The same group got money from the Conservatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: I'm not sure what
 that money went for. This grant went specifically to organizing 
protests. It literally says in there in black and white.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Do you think they should pull the money?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: I don't believe 
that groups that are using those funds to actively advocate protests, I 
don't know that we... SOLOMON: So are you saying, I thought you were a 
free speech guy. You campaigned on the free speech guy. Let people who 
disagree with talk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: Free speech is 
different than using government funds to advocate or to protest. The 
difference here is that we, in fact what the Liberals are doing is, 
they're taking away someone's right of free speech, or free thought, 
free opinion by pulling their funding if they don't share the same view.
 What we're saying is the government has the right to say these types of
 activities aren't funded. They don't have the right to impose their 
values or their beliefs on someone, and that's the difference here. It's
 a huge issue. I know the Liberals would love this to be characterized 
as a free speech issue. It's not. It's about them funding the very 
people that they say need to get grant permission. Justin Trudeau has 
invented the term of <b>social license</b> and empowering all these 
protestors, and then he goes out and gives them money to block the very 
thing that he's trying to get built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: I got to leave it there. Andrew Scheer, great to have you here, Sir.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: Always fun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: All right, 
coming up on this program. In the wake of the mass murder in Toronto, is
 it time for the government to redefine what qualifies as terrorism? MPs
 are joining us and we'll look at the darkest part of the internet where
 hatred for women is prevalent. That's next. Stay right here on 
"Question Period".</p>

 is not just pipelines that Canada has a hard time getting done. Putting
 money where the country's mouth is on climate change is turning out to 
be at least as hard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, two provinces 
turned to the courts to challenge core elements of Prime Minister Justin
 Trudeau's plan to reconcile Canada's energy ambitions with its 
climate-change obligations.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As
 previously announced, the government of British Columbia is asking that
 province's top court to clarify whether it has the constitutional 
authority to regulate the amount of bitumen oil that transits through 
its territory. The answer will not be forthcoming for a while and 
certainly not in time for the May 31 deadline set by <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> to fish or cut bait on its expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A favourable court ruling
 for B.C. could have consequences for the profitability of all future 
interprovincial pipelines, starting with the Trans Mountain expansion. 
In the immediate future, the move by the province's minority NDP 
government means that project will likely not go ahead without an 
injection of public funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If he loses the court battle, Premier John Horgan says he will consider the <b>pipeline</b>
 matter closed. But that might only happen once the province has 
exhausted all its legal recourses. If the case makes its way to the 
Supreme Court, this debate could stretch beyond the next B.C. election. 
The government of Saskatchewan has also gone to its top court to 
challenge the federal government - Trudeau's plan to impose a carbon tax
 on provinces that fail to take steps to meet the carbon-pricing 
threshold set by Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ontario and Alberta, 
the Conservative opposition parties support Saskatchewan's move. If 
elected to power later this spring and next year, Doug Ford and Jason 
Kenney have both said they would fight Trudeau's carbon-pricing policy 
in court. Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is planning to campaign next
 year on a promise to repeal the Liberal climate-change framework.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all the drama 
surrounding the battle to stop the Trans Mountain project, the political
 forces aligning against Trudeau's climate-change strategy are no less 
consequential. They are also just as uncompromising in their stance as 
the anti-<b>pipeline</b> foes, whose intractable opposition to the Trans Mountain project they so vehemently denounce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he set out the terms 
of his province's carbon tax challenge on Wednesday, Saskatchewan 
Premier Scott Moe argued that provinces are not subsidiaries of the 
federal government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent Supreme Court 
beer ruling demonstrated that contention has a constitutional 
foundation. But the irony that Saskatchewan is invoking the same 
federalism principle to fight Trudeau's carbon tax as B.C. is in its 
challenge to the federally backed <b>pipeline</b> is apparently lost on Moe and his federal and provincial allies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau came to power 
touting a two-pronged approach to energy and climate change. His 
government would put in place a national framework for carbon pricing 
and make a start toward meeting Canada's international obligations to 
reduce greenhouse gases. But it would also have the back of the fossil 
fuel industry as it sought to expand its reach to markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two-and-a-half years 
later, few of the protagonists in the debate have bought into Trudeau's 
proposed compromise, they have sidestepped it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notwithstanding the prime
 minister's carbon-pricing initiatives, climate change activists in B.C.
 and elsewhere and their like-minded Indigenous allies are not about to 
give a <b>social license</b> to <b>pipeline</b> projects. Opposition to 
the Trans Mountain expansion is more deeply rooted in concerns over the 
increased risk of oil spills at sea than in the project's contribution 
to greenhouse-gas emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other side of the 
debate, the Conservative opposition to Trudeau's carbon-pricing policy 
is not tied to the obstacles standing in the way of the Trans Mountain 
expansion. If those obstacles were removed tomorrow, Scheer, Ford, 
Kenney and Moe would not blink an eye in their battle against a federal 
carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Trudeau, winning the <b>pipeline</b>
 battle would not translate into winning the carbon-pricing war. It 
would only impose on his government an even greater obligation to ensure
 its carbon-pricing plan is equally implemented. The prime minister has 
said he will see the Trans Mountain project done, even if that means 
forcing the hand of B.C.'s government and losing support in B.C. before 
next year's federal election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By all indications, 
Trudeau will have to show the same determination to ensure his national 
climate change framework becomes a reality in every province - again, at
 some potential risk to his party's electoral fortunes.</p>

 the understandable political uproar over Canadian pipelines (or perhaps
 more appropriately, our apparent inability to build them) was the <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span> Monthly Merchandise Trade Report in February that tracks Canada's international balance of trade.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 report indicated Canada's trade deficit amounted to $2.7 billion, which
 widened from $1.9 billion from the prior month, with imports advancing 
1.9 per cent month-over-month, mostly due to higher purchases of energy 
products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hidden within those 
summary numbers was the revelation that imports of energy products into 
Canada advanced by a material 15.4 per cent to $3.4 billion, the highest
 level since November 2014, with the largest share of those imports 
originating from the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The importation of crude 
oil and bitumen advanced 15.4 per cent, with imported refined petroleum 
products up by 24.1 per cent, the latter due largely to increased 
imports of gasoline into British Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's increased importation of oil and its products reflects a growing trend in the past two years. In December 2015, the <span class="companylink">U.S. Congress</span> ended a 40-year ban on oil exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accompanied by surging 
U.S. production, crude oil exports from the U.S. to Canada (seasonally 
adjusted), have risen from $6.4 billion from September 2015 to February 
2016, to $8.4 billion from September 2017 to February of this year, or 
by about a-third.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While these numbers 
fluctuate monthly, the point is that in February, while Canada exported 
$8.8 billion in energy, it also imported $3.38 billion from 
international sources which, according to <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span>, represents a year-to-year increase of 12.3 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada produces far more 
oil than it can consume, and hence it is the world's fourth largest 
producer and third largest exporter of oil. In 2016, Canada was the 
largest foreign supplier of crude oil to the U.S., with 99 per cent of 
our oil exports directed there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada accounted for 41 per cent of total U.S. crude oil imports and 20 per cent of U.S. refinery crude oil intake. However, <span class="companylink">Natural Resources Canada</span>
 also indicated that in 2016, Canada imported crude oil and equivalents 
from many countries, including the United States (62 per cent), Saudi 
Arabia, Algeria, Nigeria and Norway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when Canadian attentions, both public and political, are riveted on our pernicious lack of <b>pipeline</b>
 access to international oil markets, we question why so little 
attention is being paid to Canada's increasing importation of petroleum 
products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It cost Canadians $3.4 
billion in February alone. To be clear, we are not arguing that a trade 
surplus or deficit is an appropriate barometer of a country's health. 
However, we do suggest that growing U.S. exports, due to deregulation, 
and our inability to build infrastructure to export our energy, is not 
beneficial to Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada could enhance its 
security of supply, reduce its trade deficit and produce fewer global 
greenhouse gas emissions if we used more of our Canadian crude oil 
production. A recent study by the <span class="companylink">Canadian Energy Research Institute</span>,
 using 2016 data, indicates that substituting Canadian oil wherever 
possible using space on existing pipelines, railcars and ocean tankers, 
could reduce foreign oil imports into Eastern Canada by a whopping 47 
per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This would save 
refineries $210 million and reduce Canadian emissions of carbon dioxide 
by the equivalent of more than two million tonnes, or about 5.7 per cent
 annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute also found 
that eastern Canadian refineries process just over one million barrels 
of oil per day, of which only 39 per cent originates from Western Canada
 and five per cent originates from the eastern Canadian offshore; fully 
56 per cent is imported from the United States (amounting to 260,000 
barrels of imported oil per day).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly, lower regulatory
 and fiscal costs would benefit all Canadians through the more efficient
 utilization of Canadian resources. Hence, we urgently need better 
policies to resolve our <b>pipeline</b> infrastructure problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a precarious B.C. 
government opposes oil pipelines, the Trudeau government's avowed 
transition away from fossil fuels appears perversely to be directed 
solely at penalizing Canadian producers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is over-regulating
 domestic producers with misdirected policies that allow foreign 
petroleum imports - unimpeded by Canadian environmental laws, so-called <b>social license</b>, greenhouse gas reduction strategies and associated taxes - to flood into Canada to displace jobs and discourage investment.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trail Daily Times -- The Trans Mountain Expansion <b>pipeline</b> has dominated news in the past few weeks. The public is divided over whether we should build this <b>pipeline</b> and allow Alberta oil sands output to increase, or whether it presents too much risk to BC's rivers and coastal environments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many experts described 
the original project approval process as deeply flawed. The Liberals 
ignored their campaign promise of a new, improved process and instead 
sent a ministerial panel along the <b>pipeline</b> route in the summer 
of 2016. Many communities and First Nations governments criticized this 
process as inadequate as well. However the panel did write a report that
 ended with a list of six clear questions for the government to answer 
before making a decision.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think it would be useful to review those questions to see more clearly how we got into this quagmire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Can construction of a new Trans Mountain <b>Pipeline</b> be reconciled with Canada's climate change commitments? Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr often proclaims "This <b>pipeline</b> will be built", but I have never heard him say "We will meet our Paris targets." For many <b>pipeline</b> opponents this is the crux of the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. In the absence of a 
comprehensive national energy strategy, how can policy-makers 
effectively assess projects such as the Trans Mountain <b>Pipeline</b>? 
Canada needs a national energy strategy that would answer broader 
questions such as: what role new pipelines would play in a world where 
world oil demand (according to the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>
 itself) will begin declining in 2019; how we might refine our oil 
resources for our own use rather than exporting bitumen and importing 
foreign oil on the Atlantic coast; and how we can create good jobs in 
renewable energy as the world shifts to a low carbon future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. How might Cabinet square approval of the Trans Mountain <b>Pipeline</b>
 with its commitment to reconciliation with First Nations and to the 
UNDRIP principles of "free, prior, and informed consent?" This is 
perhaps the key question that the federal government failed to answer 
before it approved the Trans Mountain Expansion. There is strong 
opposition to the project from many First Nations, and a number of 
lawsuits are in the courts arguing that the approval process did not 
involve proper consultation. If this is found to be the case (as it was 
in the Northern Gateway <b>pipeline</b> decision) it could delay the project another year or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. Given the changed 
economic and political circumstances, the perceived flaws in the NEB 
process, and also the criticism of the Ministerial Panel's own review, 
how can Canada be confident in its assessment of the project's economic 
rewards and risks? According to Nanos Research only 2% of Canadians have
 strong confidence in Canada's energy regulation system, a fact that 
bears on the discontent seen on both sides of this debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. If approved, what 
route would best serve aquifer, municipal, aquatic and marine safety? 
Kinder Morgan has not yet asked the government for approval of the exact
 route for much of the <b>pipeline</b>; in many cases the old route will not be followed, especially in the Lower Mainland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6. How does federal policy define the terms "<b>social license</b>"
 and "Canadian public interest" and their inter-relationships? Through 
the election campaign, Justin Trudeau repeated the mantra "governments 
can grant permits, but only communities grant permission". The federal 
government now finds itself in a very difficult situation, having to 
tell coastal British Columbians that the project is in the national 
interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is now too late to 
answer these questions before Kinder Morgan's self-imposed deadline of 
May 31, but we would have been in a much better situation had the 
government fully dealt with them before approving the Trans Mountain 
expansion project.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime
 Minister Justin Trudeau is traveling through Europe this week, standing
 shoulder-to-shoulder with world leaders as he charmingly promotes 
Canada as a nation that is open for investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, we at home are
 left to muse about Trudeau's seeming inability to ensure that such 
opportunity truly exists in Canada and for Canadians.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite his many promises, Trudeau has done nothing to ensure the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> <b>pipeline</b>
 will become a reality. His unwillingness to take an authoritative and 
supportive stand behind the project now has investors in the 
$7.4-billion <b>pipeline</b> prepared to take their dollars elsewhere. 
Thousands of jobs, the viability of Alberta's economy and Canada's "open
 for business" status are all at stake, yet Trudeau appears content to 
remain on the sidelines as tensions rise across the country, with 
threats of interprovincial trade wars and constitutional challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years of careful reviews and innumerable environmental studies, the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>, the federal government and the prime minister all concluded that the <b>pipeline</b> is safe. Every court challenge has ruled in favour of the project going ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet noisy protestors have
 somehow managed to strip away the legitimacy of the authority that 
stands behind those decisions. They refuse to recognize the rule of law,
 in part because Trudeau himself has allowed them to become legitimate 
influencers of his energy policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2015, he said that 
pipelines were the most responsible way to get oil to markets, but then 
added that pipelines "have to achieve the public trust and the <b>social license</b> that is necessary." <b>Social license</b>? Cue the protestors. With that one comment, Trudeau has given them equal standing with facts, science and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau has long been a 
master of doublespeak, using his smile and adorable socks to take the 
edge off words that might offend. Even as he promises to build a <b>pipeline</b>, he has promised to "phase out" the oilsands (the very same oilsands for which he claims he is building the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> <b>pipeline</b>).
 He has said he is committed to moving oil out of Alberta, yet has sold 
his soul to the environmentalists with his unquestioning support for 
carbon taxes as a means of influencing climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunday's <b>pipeline</b> 
summit in Ottawa lasted just a couple of hours and proved to be just one
 more demonstration of Trudeau's inability to exert federal authority 
for a project that is, in his own words, "of vital strategic interest to
 Canada." He offered his usual prime ministerial promises to get the <b>pipeline</b>
 built and even vowed to invest Canadian dollars as a surety of his 
government's support. In doing so, Trudeau played the kind of politics 
that Canadians most loathe - throwing taxpayer money at a problem that 
could (and should) have been handled previously and sans lucre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, Trudeau did 
nothing to reduce interprovincial tensions. Alberta Premier Rachel 
Notley has since introduced legislation to stop the flow of oil to B.C.,
 while Premier John Horgan has vowed to continue to resist just so he 
can stay in power. Saskatchewan and Quebec are now getting involved and 
investigating possible actions in support of Alberta and B.C., 
respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The whole country seems on the cusp of a crisis. Well done, Mr. Trudeau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, when a Vancouver Sun online poll asked readers if they were surprised by the outcome of the so-called <b>pipeline</b> summit, 80 per cent agreed with the comment, "No, this is exactly how I thought it would play out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not exactly support 
for Trudeau as a man of action. Rather, it's confirmation that Trudeau 
has played both sides of this debate for too long - neither side sees 
him as able to restore federal authority over the provinces or provide 
the necessary support for a megaproject of vital interest to Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Lead, follow, or get out of the way." It's a basic axiom for successful leadership. Mr. Trudeau would do well to consider it.</p>

get right to this Trudeau thing. He has this emergency summit on the

 and then you have a law that's going to be tabled to reaffirm that you 
have jurisdiction, but if you have jurisdiction, why do you need the law
 reaffirm it. It's very unclear. Basically, he's trying to buy time and,
 and reassure investors. But it's still a stalemate. There's still no, 
no progress. We'll see what happens.</p>

 best-case scenario is they pour a bunch of public money into this, and 
then you get the grandmothers still turning out to stand in front of the
 bulldozers. I mean, the biggest thing that is going to stop this <b>pipeline</b>
 is not going to be money. It's not going to be legalities. It's not 
going to be regulations. It's going to be, does this government have the
 stomach to, for day after day of really ugly, public confrontations? 
And in past, the answer generally is no, and I'm not sure this 
government is any different.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: I guess, and 
particularly with a lot of indigenous people might be joining that

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HARRISON: Yeah, there's 
no doubt that this is a political hot potato for the Liberals, and I 
don't think any opposition party envies the situation that, that they're
 in. I think we can all agree that the meeting itself was the right 
thing to do, and the right call, but where we might disagree is at what 
point that meeting should have happened. So, certainly had this 
conversation started a bit earlier, maybe five, six months ago, or you 
know, not long after John Horgan got elected in, in June last year, 
maybe we would be in a different position than we are now. But 
certainly, it's a, it's a challenging file but had intervention happened
 earlier, we may have not had the need for the meeting on Sunday.</p>

GREG MACEACHERN (Proof Strategies): The meeting, absolutely. I think for
 one thing, Canadians aren't really familiar with the British Columbia 
premier. Now they've gotten a chance to see him. I think they are 
familiar with Notley. And I think, you know, you just need to do this so
 that you can say this has been done. To Kate's point, though, I think 
there have been conversations between the prime minister and the BC 
premier where he's been offered things about, I think Trudeau 
understands the political position that he's in. I think the NDP 
understand it. You and I both know the column last week where the NDP 
had to reveal in BC that on day one, they received advice that if they 
chose to live up to their campaign promise...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACEACHERN: ...which was to fight this <b>pipeline</b>
 at any cost, they would be sued. You notice now the premier of BC has 
changed his language on this. I think the other thing is we've seen from
 the opposition party no great ideas, and I think that is kind of 
telling about how tough a situation it is. Jagmeet Singh got laughed out
 of Ottawa within minutes by the premier of Alberta. And Scheer, I, was 
it budget day? What was the rush to try to get a message out before the 
meeting even happened? So, I don't think you can look to the opposition 
parties and say, well, they've got great ideas. The prime minister 
should listen to them. This is an easy out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Greg, I'm curious if you...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WESTON: Could I just say one thing to this, Don.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Okay. Always.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WESTON: Sorry. I think 
the most important thing about what happened yesterday was the photo-op.
 You know, Canadians hear this great barrage of we're going to do this 
and you're going to do that and we're against this and it all becomes 
just white noise after a while. What they saw yesterday was the prime 
minister sitting down with the premiers of the two provinces. There's a,
 a photo of them smiling. There's a clip of them all smiling for the 
cameras. And the prime minister is kind of seated at the, what looks 
like the head of the table. It's actually in one chair versus two sofas 
that the other two were on. So I think that sort of gives people the 
sense that, okay, this is Canada. Our brawls at least are friendly. 
Everybody's still smiling. There's something happening there. There's at
 least hope for this that we're not into a stand-off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HARRISON: Unless things don't go through, because then that's the photo they'll use on June 1st if <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> actually decides not to proceed with this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: I'm still 
bedazzled by the fact that Greg Weston, who I've known for 20 years, is 
bedazzled by a photo-op. I've never heard that before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: But you know, one
 thing that was missing in that photo, Karl, I don't know if you think 
it's a big deal, or not - no indigenous representation at all. Was that 
smart that we kept that just to the premiers and the prime minister? Or 
should they have had someone there, because they're divided? There's a 
lot of division in the First Nations community along that route.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BELANGER: There is a lot 
of division. But I think it's probably a mistake to keep them at bay 
here, and especially considering the promise that the prime minister 
made during the campaign, which was basically to consult Aboriginals and
 First Nations, all, all along this process. Not doing it. And the key 
thing is that, you know, to build this <b>pipeline</b>, the prime minister needs <b>social license</b>. If he doesn't have <b>social license</b>, he needs political will. At this point, I'm not sure he's got either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WESTON: And who exactly is the indigenous leader, or representative, who is going to be there?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACEACHERN: Well, that's probably why they're not in the room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BELANGER: But...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACEACHERN: I don't know.
 Trudeau keeps saying that this is going to be built. I think that's 
huge political will. That's what you're going to see. Not that photo. 
You're going to see clips and clips of him saying this <b>pipeline</b> is going to be built. That's why I think I'm very confident that they're going to find a way to do this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Hmm. Are you?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HARRISON: He has been 
saying that since the beginning. Now, he actually hasn't waffled on his 
position that he wants to see this built. But what's been missing is the
 action to get there. And he has been saying it for a long time, and we 
still have <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> wavering about
 whether, or not, they have the climate to proceed. So, we'll see what's
 in the legislation. We'll see how much money the government is willing 
to put behind this because that has, that wasn't answered yesterday...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HARRISON: ...is how much are they actually going to pay for this?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: And whether it's equity or just backstopping losses...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HARRISON: That's right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: ...is another question, you know?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACEACHERN: Or <span class="companylink">environmental safeguards</span> .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Okay. I want to 
move along. I was going to ask about Daniel Jean, but I'm not sure, did 
anyone think that was a really huge...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACEACHERN: This was the 
worst case of broken, game of broken telephone ever. And we just saw how
 Ottawa breaks down between reporters, the opposition and government. I 
think if they had put him out earlier, the government would be in a much
 better place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Yeah.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACEACHERN: I think he 
did a great job for the government today. He really cooled things. Mr.

win today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: You were wincing a little bit there, Mr. Weston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WESTON: Well, you know, 
one thing, and I'll just mention it, having been around for a few years,
 I think this is the first time that I've ever seen the national 
security advisor inject himself into a public discussion about anything.
 I mean, they just don't show up very often.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WESTON: And so it's kind 
of interesting from that perspective. Why would, why would he go out 
there and do this? And I think he, I think he did it for all the right 
reasons. If there's one person in government who I would actually trust,
 for what they're saying, for what they're telling you, it would be the 
national security advisor. And if he says it didn't happen, I would be 
inclined to believe him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Yeah. Kate, I'm 
wondering what the missing part of this narrative is now, because it 
looks to me like he said the story that he basically told the 
journalists. I didn't see a whole lot of things he told the journalists 
that are yet to be unclassified, if you will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HARRISON: Right. Well, 
and that kind of begs the question as to why the government was, sort 
of, dragging their heels on having him appear at committee in the first 
place. I think we all agree that had they come out earlier, we'd be 
maybe in a different situation. But there was this...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACEACHERN: ...precedent, as Greg Weston just said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WESTON: Well, not only 
that, but the guy who's got all the secrets in government, and all the 
secrets, he is the national security advisor. He's the guy who deals 
with the CIA and the NSA and...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HARRISON: Of course, but that's what makes for...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WESTON: You don't want to put him in front of a parliamentary committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HARRISON: That's what 
makes his testimony so, so important, though, is that gravitas and that 
knowledge and that power he has. So, for this initial story to come out 
saying that he was, you know, putting this idea forward that the Indian 
government was involved or that was alleged national security, or senior
 authority and national security, that's what made today so important. 
We still don't have an answer on Atwal in spite of that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WESTON: It, it's possible
 that everybody in government was as stunned as I was that this became, 
is still actually a story over this one guy who showed up for lunch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Karl?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BELANGER: I think, I 
think that the reason they were dragging their heels is because this was
 embarrassing. They were embarrassed, and I think the story is now 
probably winding down because there's not...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WESTON: Oh, thank god.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BELANGER: ...there's not 
much here, but the opposition dragged it along for a very long time, so 
in that sense, I disagree with G-Mac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Yeah.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BELANGER: It's a win for the opposition to have to carry this quite so long.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACEACHERN: I don't know if I said that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Well, let's 
quickly go down here. We've only got a couple of minutes left. The 
Liberals are huddling in Halifax at the end of this week to sort of push
 the, get some policy ideas, the last time they gathered as a group to 
come up with some new ideas before the election campaign. But I'm 
wondering, do they need a reset? Do they need a reset, this government? 
Or are they doing fine the way they are?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BELANGER: I don't think 
they need a reset. I don't think they need new ideas. They just need to 
look at their last platform and start implementing it. That would be a 
nice thing to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Greg? That's you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WESTON: This is, this is...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: It's you, Greg. Not this Greg. He's G-Mac. You're Greg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WESTON: Okay. All right. 
Every once in a while you need to get all the troops together and at 
least have a pep rally. They're eighteen months before the next 
election. They're very much starting to move into election mode. There 
are, this is unusual for this government. This is the first time that 
they've had a sustained dip in public opinion polls. It's making a lot 
of the backbenchers and a lot of the ground troops are going to need for
 that election campaign who they need them to start working now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Yeah.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WESTON: Are going to need
 to hear a little bit of pep rally and know that the world is still 
good, that it's not really falling apart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Kate?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HARRISON: Yeah, it's 
going to be a rah-rah in Halifax for sure. And conventions have the 
potential to be a bit of bloodletting, as well, and we may see a bit of 
that on the fringe, although, you know, I, I'm doubtful about that. You 
know, it's a tricky time in the mandate, and when you are going into 
convention having, you know, not had a platform or ads, etcetera, which 
is what Scheer will benefit from later this year. For the existing 
government, that's a little bit more of a challenge because they have to
 defend the record and put their plan forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Thirty seconds to you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACEACHERN: If you look 
at the mandate letters, a lot of stuff is done, but I think if they 
prorogue, the problem is, you look at the record. The House has not been
 their strength. I think they need a number three person who loves 
parliament like they love a church, and that they really try to get the 
mandate through there, but I think if they prorogue, people are going to
 look at the record, not the mandate letters. It's the last convention 
before the election. So I'm just hoping not to be the broken man on the 
Halifax pier by Sunday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: You are bad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BELANGER: What's the over/under on that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(LAUGHTER)</p>

 SOLOMON: Welcome back to "Question Period". Well, the stakes could not 
be higher. The prime minister is, right now, in an emergency meeting 
with the premiers of BC and Alberta. He's clearly desperate to emerge 
with a way to get the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b> built. Earlier in 
the program, the natural resource minister, Jim Carr, strongly hinted 
that the government will financially support the <b>pipeline</b>, so <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 doesn't pull the plug on it before their May 31st deadline. Clearly 
though, BC opposes it. And Alberta's ready to start a trade war over it.
 What does the prime minister have to deliver today? We're waiting for 
them all to emerge from this meeting. So, it could happen at any moment,
 and we'll go live to that, but the scrum is here waiting for that. 
Laura Stone, reporter with the Globe and Mail is here; Craig Oliver, 
CTV's chief political commentator is here; and Bob Fife, the Globe and 
Mail's Ottawa bureau chief is here. Look, we don't know. At any moment, 
they could emerge. We're expecting, actually, the BC premier, Mr. 
Horgan, to emerge first. I don't know, he seems intractable. Bob, what 
are you expecting the government to emerge from this meeting with?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ROBERT FIFE (The Globe 
and Mail): Well, federal officials are saying they did not expect any 
kind of significant movement from Premier Horgan on that. So they 
already have their game plan. Their game plan, as one official said to 
me, the main objective is to remove during the period of construction, 
the risk that the company can't or won't do. And so what we're going to 
expect later today when the prime minister makes an announcement, I 
think, around 1:00 o'clock, he will announce that Finance Minister Bill 
Morneau will now open discussions with the company on a number of 
options. One of them is, do you take an equity stake in this? Or do we 
provide some kind of risk insurance? There are other options. A big 
trigger is, do they expropriate the <b>pipeline</b> route? That's 
probably going to be mentioned in that meeting, which may give heart 
palpitations to Premier Horgan. Whether we'll actually go that route, I 
don't know. And they will certainly be told with, raise the issue of 
let's take this to the Supreme Court. The feds have already done their 
homework on that. They do not believe that the court would see this as 
an emergency, and besides that, it would take twelve to eighteen months 
for a court to make that kind of hearing, and we have the deadline 
marching on to May 31st.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: All right. 
Likely financial backing, likely invoking what's called expropriation, 
which means the government can just expropriate the land, and that's a 
flexing of federal jurisdiction muscles. Sources also telling me, don't 
expect a firm detailed plan financially. It's not like Bill Morneau and 
the prime minister are going to come out and say we're buying this <b>pipeline</b>. They are going to outline a process to get there. So, I would not look for details. That's what I'm hearing right now. Laura?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAURA STONE (The Globe 
and Mail): I think it's four against one in that room, in the prime 
minister's office, right now, on Parliament Hill. There is immense 
pressure on John Horgan to save face, and I think that the message to 
him is how little do you want to be humiliated in this fight? They're 
going to try to paint him as extremely unreasonable on this. The prime 
minister is going to come out with all the environment protections that 
they've given to the oceans. That's going to be a big focus of his media
 availability today, I suspect. And so the message in there, I think why
 they're going so long is they're trying to pitch to John Horgan, how 
can you get out of this alive, because they know he's not going to 
change his mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Craig?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CRAIG OLIVER (<span class="companylink">CTV</span>
 News): Well, for Alberta, this is really the last chance saloon. I 
mean, that's what's at stake here. They will never have another chance, 
probably, to get Alberta oil to Canadian tidewater. The country has a 
lot to lose here, too, many will, many will say. I think this meeting 
will come out, if Bob is right, and he always is, with all sides having 
taken a decision, say good-bye to the great old Canadian compromise. 
They will have been taken an irreconcilable position from which they 
cannot retreat. The question is, is it going to be enough for <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Right. Here's 
what we, we do expect Premier Horgan to be the first one out of this 
meeting. We'll take it live. Just expect him to say he is not giving an 
inch. There's no indication, and the federal government sources have 
told all of us this, that Horgan will give an inch. For him, Bob, is 
this all just political theatre? He's got to show his constituency, 
which is the Green party, I ain't going to be bullied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FIFE: Well, what he is, really, is the puppet of the Green leader in BC, who is really, he's, he's the guy who's...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Andrew Weaver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FIFE: Andrew Weaver's the
 man who's making this guy go up and down. Mr. Trudeau had tried, early 
on, to work with Premier Horgan. He said, in privately, to him, look, 
let's, we've got to get this <b>pipeline</b> built. Ask me what 
concessions you want. You come out. I'll say, oh, I had to give into 
these things. It'll make you look good. And he wouldn't do so. And so 
they don't really trust this guy anymore, because they've given him some
 options, and he doesn't want to play. And he doesn't want to play 
because he doesn't want to lose his government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: I'll tell you 
now, now, Laura, you said it's four against one, because the finance 
minister, the natural resource minister, Jim Carr, the prime minister 
are all in the room with Rachel Notley and Premier Horgan. I'll tell 
who's not in the room? There is no First Nations representative. And we 
spoke to the national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, Perry 
Bellegarde, about this. And they are livid that they have been excluded 
from this summit. Here's what Perry Bellegarde said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NATIONAL CHIEF PERRY BELLEGARDE (<span class="companylink">Assembly of First Nations</span>):
 I think it's a very big miss for the government. You've got the federal
 crown. You've got the provincial crowns. You're missing out the rights 
and titleholders. And that's the most important element. We have the 
right to self-determination. The rights and titleholders have to be 
involved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Okay, Perry Bellegarde saying it's a big mistake. How big a mistake?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STONE: This is a huge 
oversight on the part of the federal government. How can they say that 
they're negotiating in good faith with First Nations when you hold this 
extremely important meeting on Parliament Hill, and you exclude a voice 
from that community? I'm very shocked, in fact. I think it just shows 
how quickly this whole meeting was slapped together, as the prime 
minister was taking off for Peru. So, I think it's a big oversight, and 
it's going to do damage, I believe, to their reconciliation agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: I'm not so sure that it is that big a mistake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STONE: Oh, Craig...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: An awful lot of First Nations don't agree with the coastal chiefs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STONE: But that doesn't mean they have to be against it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: And furthermore, 
if they're there, why are they there? Are they there, is that suggesting
 that they have a veto over resource development? And that's a huge 
issue. The Supreme Court has never said they do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STONE: Well, it says they have a voice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: But Perry...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: So, are they there just to listen? That's not power. This is a time for political decision-making.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Perry Bellegarde
 said that First Nations, of course, are divided on this, as many other 
Canadians are. But this was the most important file for Justin Trudeau. 
To exclude a First Nations voice there, and Perry Bellegarde...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FIFE: Well, you know, I disagree with Laura, as well because that's not the place for the <span class="companylink">Assembly of First Nations</span>
 to be dealing with the provincial government, dealing with two resource
 issues. And I'll tell you the other thing, who does Perry Bellegarde 
speak for? There are 600 status bands that he represents, and they are 
at each other's throats, too. I mean, he can't get agreement on a lot of
 things. So...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: This, this is optics. This is about <b>social license</b>. And Laura, I've got to tell you, I believe that the prime minister...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: ...not, not having a First Nations voice...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FIFE: If you had them in that meeting, it would be more of a mess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STONE: And it doesn't 
mean it's in opposition. It's representing all the diverse views. It 
doesn't mean he's going to go and say we want to stop the <b>pipeline</b>, but he could present the different points of view of First Nations that he represents. Of course, it's on everyone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Perry Bellegarde, Perry Bellegarde was adamant. He said that <b>pipeline</b>,
 without First Nations, cannot be built. And when they're not there, the
 optics, I think, are very bad for that. And I think that, that could be
 very damaging. And I wonder, Craig, if that leads to very big protests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: This will be, if this <b>pipeline</b>
 goes ahead, it will be the biggest example of civil disobedience in 
Canadian history. It will be violent. It will be massive law breaking. 
Remember, Clayoquot Sound in 1993, 900 people went to jail. But that was
 way out in the woods. Nobody could get there. This is downtown 
Vancouver. It will be ugly and the prime minister will be seen to be 
behind those bulldozers and the people in front of the bulldozers will 
be the people who, for years, have been his biggest supporters. 
Indigenous people and environmentalists. It will be a mess for Trudeau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: All right, Bob, last word.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FIFE: Well, I'm just not sure that the people who are going to be campaigning against the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 are supporters of Justin Trudeau. I think they're supporters of the 
Green party. They're supporters more of the NDP - not the Liberal party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: All right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: Like the Trudeau of the past, who was an environmentalist, and campaigned as an environmentalist...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Well that, well,
 listen, okay. So, here's where we are right now, folks. As we're 
standing by on a special edition here of <span class="companylink">CTV</span>'s
 "Question Period" and the scrum, we are waiting for the first premier 
to emerge from this meeting. They were supposed to emerge about 40 
minutes ago. Clearly, that's maybe a good sign that it's not short. We 
were all wondering if Horgan walks out quickly, that's a bad sign. 
They're still in the meeting right now. We don't expect Horgan to have a
 concession, but the longer they're there, the more there's a 
possibility that there's some movement. We do expect the federal 
government to come out and announce some kind of support for the <b>pipeline</b>. We are standing by right here for that. Stay with us here. Live coverage of this emergency <b>pipeline</b> summit going on literally right behind us, right now, right here, on <span class="companylink">CTV</span>'s "Question Period". Stay with us.</p>

JUSTIN TRUDEAU (Canadian Prime Minister): The question is not whether the <b>pipeline</b> is going to get built. The question is how the <b>pipeline</b> gets built. And we are looking at all options.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON:
 Well the stakes could not be higher for the prime minister today. 
Rushing back from the conference in Peru, Justin Trudeau is now hosting 
an urgent meeting with the premiers of BC and Alberta to try to find a 
way to make sure the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b> is going to get built. But the company, the proponent, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>, they own the <b>pipeline</b>,
 they've set a deadline, get this going before May 31st or we will kill 
it. Now we just heard from the minister of natural resources, Jim Carr, 
tell us that the government is ready to do everything they can to make 
sure the <b>pipeline</b> gets built. He used the word de-risk, which 
might mean paying for it. Is that enough? Joining us from Calgary, 
Conservative MP Michelle Rempel; and in Victoria, we're joined by the 
NDP MP Murray Rankin. Great to have both of you here. Michelle Rempel, 
let me start with you. What more do you think the government can do to 
make sure this <b>pipeline</b> gets built?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MICHELLE REMPEL 
(Conservative – Alberta): They can invoke section 92.10 C of the 
Constitution Act to ensure that any remaining issues that have 
provincial jurisdiction fall into federal purview. They can make sure 
that any court cases that Premier Horgan might put forward to try and 
delay the <b>pipeline</b> becomes directly referred to the Supreme Court. They can scrap Bill C-69 which the <b>pipeline</b>
 association has said if this bill goes through there will be no more 
pipelines built in Canada. They can enforce the rule of law in terms of 
protests. You know, I could go on and on. The thing that you just said, 
de-risk, this is what Jim Carr just said to you. They want to use 
taxpayer dollars to, I'm assuming it will be like a guarantee or 
something, Evan, all they want to do is kick this down the road past the
 election so that their BC Liberal MPs can get re-elected. So when you 
think about that, when you think about the fact that they ask Canadians 
to pay a carbon tax to get <b>social license</b> to get this built, 
which it didn't, and now they want federal tax dollars to de-risk it for
 them. This isn't about de-risking it for <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 or for energy sector workers, this is about politically de-risking it 
in the hopes that it will die somewhere after the election. And that is 
disgusting, and every Canadian, regardless of what side of the <b>pipeline</b> debate they're on, should be holding the government to attack. It's just fekless arrogance. It's disgusting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Okay, strong 
words there. They say they're trying to de-risk it, Murray Rankin. In 
other words, to try to get out of this May 31st deadline in some way, 
and support Rachel Notley's idea of investing in the <b>pipeline</b>. What's your view of what they're doing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MURRAY RANKIN (NDP – BC):
 Well, first of all, May 31st is a deadline set by a Houston-based 
company. Since when do allow American companies to tell us what to do in
 Canada? We have a federal government. We have provincial governments 
that do that. We wouldn't be in this mess, as you know, I think, if it 
weren't for the fact that Mr. Trudeau came to my riding of Victoria in 
the election when he was a candidate and said, you know, we're going to 
redo this whole process, and look at how diluted bitumen performs in 
marine environment, get First Nations better involved, etcetera. They 
didn't do any of that. Now we are faced with two things. We're faced 
with massive opposition to this on our coast, and we're faced with a 
provincial government of Mr. Horgan that has a strong mandate from the 
people to oppose the risk, to deal with the risks that this <b>pipeline</b> is going to create.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Now this 
meeting, this summit, Michelle Rempel, he's have got Rachel Notley in a 
room, and he's got Mr. Premier Horgan in the room, and he's got to come 
up with something. Horgan's political life depends on opposing this. 
He's in a coalition with the Green Party. They don't want the <b>pipeline</b>.
 They're trying to either, "A", delay it to death, they don't want to do
 it. They say they have jurisdiction over the environment. What does 
Justin Trudeau have to say to Premier Horgan right now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: Find his spine 
and be the prime minister of Canada. This is a project that's in the 
national interest that passed one of the most rigorous environmental 
review processes in the world. We are not talking with Venezuela or 
Saudi Arabia. And, you know, Murray's comment about we won't let 
Houston-based organizations tell us where to go, that organization is 
about to put $7.4 billion into the Canadian economy. And, frankly, how 
much money have American environmental NGOs put into the opposition of 
this pipe <b>pipeline</b>? So I find it a little rich that an NDP MP, who many organizations that are funding the anti-<b>pipeline</b>
 protests have money from outside of the country. To me this is about a 
project that unites the country. I mean I have a lot of respect for 
Murray. The reality is, though, is that this isn't just about British 
Columbia, this isn't about Alberta. This is a project that's in the 
national interest. To me, this is, it's mindboggling that Trudeau won't 
just come out and say there are five or six things that need to be done.
 Bailing out this project will not do those things. He has to get those 
things done first. And I just, you know, it's very frustrating. RANKIN: 
Evan, I respect Michelle enormously, but we're proud Canadians on the 
west coast too, and I resent this notion that Mr. Trudeau is brandishing
 the term the national interest around as if somehow be standing up for 
our oceans, standing with First Nations, standing in favour of 
endangered killer whales, that somehow we're less Canadian. I resent 
that implication tremendously. People out here are proud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Mr. Rankin, just
 to be fair, the term national interest is a legal term of what's in 
the, to invoke what's in the national interest and the federal 
jurisdiction. But let me just try to understand, just a second. Let me 
just, and you're a lawyer, so you know this, I'm trying to appreciate 
the NDP's position. Your leader, Jagmeet Singh, says he doesn't support 
the <b>pipeline</b>, but then he says he wants to go to court to try to 
understand if the government, the federal government has the 
jurisdiction to build it. My question to you, if the courts decide, if 
it went to court, that the government does have the jurisdiction, would 
he flip his support and suddenly the federal NDP would support this <b>pipeline</b>?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RANKIN: His position has been I thought constructive to try to suggest that we have a reference to the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>, which we can do very quickly with the support of the government of British Columbia, the <span class="companylink">government of Canada</span>,
 perhaps First Nations, perhaps Alberta. We can go and get a quick 
ruling on whether or not British Columbia's jurisdiction over air, land,
 and water, which all provinces have, give it some ability to stop this 
project, or at least to have a change in regulations at the provincial 
level to address the legitimate concerns that a province like British 
Columbia has. Now if the court comes up with a clear statement that, no,
 British Columbia, you have no jurisdiction at all in the face of a 
federal undertaking, then of course we believe in the rule of law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Okay, so then you would support, that's interesting. So then Mr. Singh would say, yes, I support the <b>pipeline</b>. I just want to get that clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RANKIN: He would, he's a 
lawyer. He understands that the court has spoken. Now whether or not 
there are other issues that need to be addressed outside of the legal 
process is another thing. But you're asking what that would mean in 
terms of a legal argument, of course he would have to abide and accept 
the judgment of the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Michelle Rempel?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: What you have here, Evan, is you've got two political parties that do not want this <b>pipeline</b>
 built. So what we have seen over the last 10 years is these two 
political parties use the environmental review process to put in place 
uncertainty with the hope that these projects will just die or go away 
without them having to make the political decision, or the words coming 
out of their mouth we do not want this <b>pipeline</b> built. And that's
 what Murray just danced around. This is really the shamefulness of 
this. I would actually, I would rather have the discussion where, you 
know, I remember sitting with an NDP candidate during the election on 
national TV where she just said, you know, oil should stay in the 
ground. I would rather have that debate than the sort of...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RANKIN: We're not talking about that. That is not our position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: Yeah, but we are. We are. That is where the...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RANKIN: No. Absolutely 
not! REMPEL: That is where, that's where the debate is at right now. So 
why should we raise taxpayer resources guaranteeing things, tying up the
 court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RANKIN: Well the debate is Mr. Carr is talking about de-risking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: De-risking for who? For politicians!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RANKIN: Yeah, exactly. Exactly! What does that do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: This just needs to get built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RANKIN: What does that do? What does the ownership of part of this <b>pipeline</b> by the governments of Alberta and Canada have to do the legal jurisdiction at all? Nothing!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> didn't ask for the nationalization. <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 did not ask for the nationalization of energy infrastructure. And 
frankly the last time a socialist nationalized Canada's energy industry,
 it didn't go so well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Okay. I got to 
leave it there, Murray Rankin and Michelle Rempel. We'll find out more 
today what does happen. Thanks so much for joining us. Coming up, after 
the missile strikes in Syria, what is next? Was it really mission 
accomplished, or is the situation about to spin out of control? Retired 
Major General Dave Fraser and Canada's former top spy Dick Fadden are 
here next. Stay right here with "Question Period".</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government is still 
examining its options, Carr said, but won't commit to a course of action
 before Sunday, when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau jets home from Peru 
for a hastily organized meeting in Ottawa with British Columbia Premier 
John Horgan and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What
 we're now faced with is to find ways to make sure there is more 
certainty than there is now," Carr said in an interview with The <span class="companylink">Canadian Press</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One of the ways to make 
sure there is more certainty is to look at possible financial 
arrangements that would help de-risk the project."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Pipeline</b> builder 
Kinder Morgan has halted all non-essential spending on the project until
 it gets assurances from Ottawa that the issues will be resolved. The 
federal government has until May 31 to respond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau has put a lot of 
political eggs in the Trans Mountain basket, risking political capital 
among climate-change activists in search of middle ground that allows 
for <b>pipeline</b> construction alongside improved <span class="companylink">environmental safeguards</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau, who is currently
 in Peru for the Summit of the Americas, was originally supposed to fly 
to Paris directly from Lima on Sunday for meetings with French President
 Emmanuel Macron. Instead, he'll be back in the national capital in 
search of a resolution to an intractable — and politically perilous — 
dispute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carr refused to discuss 
the specific financial options available, other than to say there are 
many of them on the table and they're all being considered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of those options, however, is to buy a stake in the <b>pipeline</b>, something Notley has already said Alberta would be willing to do. Canada and Alberta could jointly buy the <b>pipeline</b> outright, or at least a significant stake in the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another option is to provide a guaranteed source of revenue for private investors if the <b>pipeline</b> completion date misses the target for when returns on their investments were supposed to start flowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company had targeted May 31 as the make-or-break deadline to start construction if the <b>pipeline</b> was to hit those investment targets. That date is now the drop-dead date <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> has given Canada to prove the company should have the confidence to move forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Political strategist 
Robin Sears, a principal at Earnscliffe Strategy Group, said another 
option would be to increase spending on the environmental protection 
side, including on improved research into preventing and mitigating the 
impacts of a diluted bitumen spill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The company has not done
 what it needs to have done to satisfy the people of B.C. they have 
taken the steps necessary to protect the environment," said <span class="companylink">Sears</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sears said the Trudeau 
government has an oceans protection plan on paper, but hasn't done much 
if anything to put it into action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carr was only prepared to
 say Sunday's meeting between Trudeau and the premiers would be a chance
 for the various sides to share their positions and try and talk things 
out — not necessarily a day when further action would be announced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, said <span class="companylink">Sears</span>, would be a bad political move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If they come out of that
 meeting on Sunday and (Trudeau) says, 'We've made good progress and I'm
 off to Paris,' it will cost them severely," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">University of British 
Columbia politics professor Kathryn Harrison said she doesn't know that 
there is a way for everyone to come out of Sunday's meeting with a win.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They have drawn lines in the sand that are simply incompatible," said Harrison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau and Carr have 
spent more than two years accusing the former Conservative government of
 themselves failing to build pipelines because they stacked the deck 
against environmental concerns, failing in the process to get the <b>social license</b> necessary to allow the projects to proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals introduced 
new review processes that accounted for things like the potential 
greenhouse gas emissions resulting from increased oil flows. The <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>'s 2016 approval of Trans Mountain required monitoring and upstream emissions offsets related to construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But environmental 
concerns remain — including the risk of higher emissions from increased 
oilsands production and the environmental impact of a spill. As a 
result, environmentalists who helped get Trudeau elected are now 
doubting his commitment to the cause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harrison said Trudeau has staked a claim on being able to reconcile both interests, offering up the <b>pipeline</b>
 — and the resulting ability to get resources to market — as a quid pro 
quo to get provincial and stakeholder support for a carbon price and 
environmental investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That was the compromise 
and they got pretty far with it," Harrison said, noting all provinces 
but Saskatchewan signed onto the climate change framework.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're at that point now 
where the trains are colliding. This is a moment of truth for Canada and
 a country that relies heavily on producing fossil fuels."</p>

 )</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome to government, 
where events never pause and most days are an endless series of bad and 
worse choices. Trudeau is certainly down to bad and worse on the 
question of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s crown jewel, which happens to double as his fig-leaf on oil and gas policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau the green carbon-taxer might really, really (really) want this singular <b>pipeline</b>
 built, but if the company building it is now wavering, and the Green 
party dependent NDP premier of the province through which it must pass 
hasn't yet found a body he won't chuck in front of it, at what point do 
you call a spade no spade and concede the Earth will not be moving?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps fearing for its economic and constitutional credibility, the answer from Team Trudeau is a ringing "not now, not ever."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are determined to see
 (Trans Mountain) built," Trudeau has told reporters. "It is in the 
national interest. It doesn't make any sense for us to continue to have a
 $15-billion discount on our oil resources because we are trapped with 
an American market. We need to get our resources to new markets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed. The same words could have - and did - come out of Stephen Harper's mouth. Trudeau now has to bell the cat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Green Party Leader Elizabeth May, centre, is arrested by RCMP officers after joining protesters outside <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s facility in Burnaby, B.C., on March 23, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't meant to be this way. Harper's confrontational "cram-them-down-your-throats" <b>pipeline</b> policy was to be replaced with Trudeau's more charismatic approach that would accrue the "<b>social license</b>"
 needed to grease construction, a canard that happens to be, despite the
 environmental hysteria, the only fauna killed to date along the <b>pipeline</b>'s route.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To frame the debate as pro-economy versus pro-environment is to miss the point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Trans Mountain 
ultimately proves is the past 20 years of debate in Canada has split 
people into two irreconcilable camps: pro-oil and anti-oil. Preening at 
climate summits and taxing carbon won't make exporting oil kosher to 
those who are resolutely opposed. Over their dead bodies is the message 
being passed to Trudeau at the minute. It's not a question of law, it's a
 matter of will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Giddy though the 
opposition parties might be, now is not the time for them to revel in 
Trudeau's mire. Seeing your opponent hoist with his own petard is 
satisfying, but if the <b>pipeline</b> really is in Canada's national 
interest - and it is - the opposition should offer some constructive 
suggestions along with any withering scorn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the rather shouty and petty state of modern politics, this won't happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The partisan urge to 
nanny-nanny-boo-boo is too strong and besides, Conservatives will say, 
the Liberals didn't exactly lift a finger of support in opposition 
before assuming office and turning the matter into a constitutional 
crisis. Further disincentivizing bipartisan efforts is the Trudeau 
carbon tax, a big part of the government's <b>social license</b> play that is not particularly well-read by any capital-C Conservative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Alberta Premier Rachel Notley talks to cabinet members about the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> <b>pipeline</b> expansion, in Edmonton on Monday, April 9, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here, Trudeau shoulders a
 good chunk of the blame. For all his talk of kumbaya, Trudeau's Pan 
Canadian Framework for Clean Energy and Climate Change - with its plan 
for carbon "pricing" - was effectively crammed down provincial throats. 
And with Rachel Notley and Kathleen Wynne's governments now in severe 
financial distress, voters there and across Canada will surely begin to 
wonder why the hell they're on the road to higher taxes if those uppity 
British Columbians aren't holding up their end of the <b>social-license</b> bargain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is where federal NDP
 leader Jagmeet Singh should have a useful intervention to make, given 
it's his provincial brethren on opposite sides of the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 dispute. But to hope for substance from Singh is to wish for unicorns. 
Singh has done the easy thing and sided with B.C. and its brighter 
federal electoral prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where does this leave Trans Mountain? Shorn of friends and solutions, but all is not yet lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government can, and should, re-assert its constitutional right to build the <b>pipeline</b>. And yes, the feds can join Alberta in slapping down money and insurance guarantees. But that's only half the battle.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the communities along the <b>pipeline</b>
 route remain ready to obstruct its construction it's going to take a 
lot more than bucks and words to clear the way. Even the stern words of a
 judge urging protesters out of the way might not do the trick. What 
then?</p>

not a continuation of a Goldilocks not-too-hot, not-too-cold mantra that
 works as a sound bite, but not always as policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau has allowed 
himself to be held hostage by a Texas-based energy corporation so tone

defining moment for the Trudeau government, with the clock ticking; a

Conservative MPs have been hit by a collective amnesia that makes them 
forget 10 years of Stephen Harper championing various pipelines

infamous Harper declaration that Obama's approval of the Keystone XL <b>pipeline</b>, was a "no-brainer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Harper okayed the Northern Gateway <b>pipeline</b>,

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DON MARTIN: And we expect
 that premiers meeting with the finance minister to wrap up in the next 
while, and we'll bring Bill Morneau's response when it happens. In the 
meantime, let's bring in the lead minister on the <b>pipeline</b> file. 
And Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr joins us from Winnipeg. Minister
 Carr, I appreciate you can't break cabinet confidence, but time is 
ticking away. You huddled with your colleagues yesterday to come up with
 a Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b> rescue plan. What's emerged from those discussions beyond the revelation that all options are still on the table?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
JIM CARR (Natural Resources Minister): Well, for Canadians to know that 
the government is 100 percent behind the construction of this <b>pipeline</b>.
 It's not a question of whether it will be built or not, it's the 
question of how. We're looking at financial and regulatory options that 
are available to us. Legal options too. We're certainly keen to have 
conversations with willing partners, and that would be the government of
 Alberta, it would be <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>, 
and one can maybe even hope the government of British Columbia. I don't 
know if that's going to happen because most of all they have been 
sending out cloudy signals and trying to create a climate of 
uncertainty, which is the last thing our proponent wants. This is a <b>pipeline</b>
 as you know that's in federal jurisdiction, and we believe we have the 
legal authority, and we have even as important as that, we believe we 
have the good argument that most Canadians will understand about why it 
should be built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Are you ready for
 what's coming, though? You know you're going to encounter very strong 
protests as construction moves ahead. You know you're coming against a 
province that is going to fight you tooth and nail in the courts and in 
any other way it can. You're saying that no matter what happens, no 
matter what obstacles go up before you, that <b>pipeline</b> is going through?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CARR: I'm saying that 
people are allowed to protest. It's what makes us special as a nation, 
as long as they protest legally. If they don't, and we have seen it, 
people will get arrested. That's the way the system works. It's the rule
 of law. And they're free to protest if they disagree with the 
government. We believe that we have the jurisdiction that has been 
proven time and time again by the courts, including the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>. So we have the jurisdiction, we think we've got the good arguments, and we have the determination to see the <b>pipeline</b> built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: But, but your prime minister, our prime minister always said we need the, quote, "<b>social license</b>" to move these through. Do you have that as well?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CARR: We consulted 
British Columbians and Canadians in a way that had never been done 
before. After the decision in the Northern Gateway case we knew we had 
to do a lot better than the Harper government had done, so we asked an 
expert panel to go up and down the line. They did. Tens of thousands of 
people weighed in, including British Columbians, and we believe that it 
was a very thorough process that gave us what we believe to be all of 
the good arguments for families, for the Canadian economy, for the 
expansion of export markets, for a $1.5 billion investment in the ocean 
protection plan. We think that the elements of the good decision were 
there, and we made it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Just make sure, 
just to make this interview a little different from the one Monday, I 
want to ask you a couple questions if I can. Is the withholding of BC 
transfer payments as advocated by Alberta's Jason Kenney, is that an 
option?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CARR: You know we're not 
looking to ratchet up rhetoric here. We're making the arguments of why 
we think this is good for the country, and we're looking at all kinds of
 options that will make it clear to British Columbia and to all of 
Canada that the federal government is determined to see this <b>pipeline</b> built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Well, withholding
 transfer payments would make it very clear to British Columbians what 
you're up against. Just asking if that's one of the options that you've 
got on the table?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CARR: You know, don, I've
 said, yeah, you know, we've been I think pretty clear about the buckets
 of options that are available to us and that we're considering 
carefully, and financial and regulatory are two of them. So we'll see 
how things develop over time, but the message, the clear message is that
 this <b>pipeline</b> is good for the Canadian economy and it is good for Canadian families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: We got that. 
Quick final point. Jagmeet Singh, the NDP leader, comes out today and 
says his game plan is to send this to the Supreme Court for some sort of
 reference, joint reference. Is that an option? Do you think that's a 
good idea, or is that something you're not even considering at this 
time?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CARR: I think that Mr. 
Singh constructively could do the country a favour if he called a 
meeting with the two NDP premiers of British Columbia and Alberta to see
 if he can't help broker a national unity consensus in his own party. 
And that consensus would be this is good for Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: All right. I'll say at this time go Jets go tonight. Thank you, Minister, appreciate you joining us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CARR: Thank you! My pleasure.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's well known that 
Canada's regulatory environment is among the most robust in the world, 
ensuring the highest regard for the environment, including limiting 
greenhouse gas emissions. In recent years, Alberta has imposed a carbon 
tax and capped oilsands emissions in the naive hope of securing

shipping industry is meeting in London this week to see if it can agree 
on a strategy to reduce emissions from the cargo ships, oil tankers and 
other vessels that traverse the planet's oceans. This is serious work, 
because such emissions were excluded from the Paris Climate Agreement in
 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This means that when 
Eastern Canada buys its fuel from countries such as Saudi Arabia, 
Azerbaijan, Nigeria and Angola, the oil isn't just produced using less 
rigorous environmental standards than those in Canada. It also means the

to controls on their greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet Eastern Canadians welcome the tankers with open arms, while vehemently opposing Canadian pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If action isn't taken, 
the organization says emissions from shipping could grow by up to 250 
per cent by 2050. International shipping emissions are not assigned to 
any one country, according to The <span class="companylink">Canadian Press</span>,
 but on their own, they are higher than the total emissions from all but
 the six biggest national emitters - China, the United States, India, 
Russia, Japan and Germany.</p>

 projects to calculate the upstream and downstream environmental 
emissions - which is pollution produced during extraction and when the 
fuel is burned in vehicles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No such burden is placed 
on Eastern Canadian carmakers or plane manufacturers, of course. Or on 
ships that deliver foreign oil to Eastern ports.</p>

 Gateway, Energy East, and now the suspension of the Trans Mountain 
expansion has confirmed that this promise was worthless."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pointed to the 
"uncertainty" created by the opposition of the B.C. government as the 
reason for the sudden announcement and said it will take until May 31 to
 consult with stakeholders to determine whether the project will 
continue construction through B.C. and whether shareholders can be 
protected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the company cannot 
reach an agreement with the various stakeholders by the May 31 deadline,
 Kinder Morgan chairman and CEO Steve Kean said it is "difficult to 
conceive of any scenario in which we would proceed with the project."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a Sunday press conference, Premier Rachel Notley said "this <b>pipeline</b>
 will be built". and threatened government action against B.C. if John 
Horgan's government - whom she called "short-sighted" - continued to 
oppose the project. She called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to act 
in defence of the project, which the federal government has approved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Albertans have been clear: Get this <b>pipeline</b> built. And Albertans are right," said Notley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Never count Alberta out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This <b>pipeline</b> will
 be built. Tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars to the 
economy. Better public schools. Better public hospitals. That's what 
this <b>pipeline</b> means for us and for our country as a whole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are also calling on 
the federal government to act in the defence of Alberta and working 
people in Western Canada in the way they have in the past for other 
parts of this country. A federal approval of a project must be worth 
more than the paper it's written on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warkentin said he shares "the frustration of Albertans" but is not surprised to see the project "faltering".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Canadians have come to expect this lack of progress, given the Prime Minister's track record of failure," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Canadians deserve a 
government that will actually get the job done. On behalf of the 
residents in the Peace Country and across Alberta and Canada, I'll 
continue to fight for economic opportunities in the energy sector and 
advocate for important pipelines that will help export our products to 
the world."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late Sunday, Trudeau tweeted the federal government "will act within national interests".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Access to world markets 
for Canadian resources is a core national interest. The Trans Mountain 
expansion will be built," tweeted Trudeau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley said Sunday the province is prepared to invest in the <b>pipeline</b>
 directly if it would help keep investors on board - a notion opposition
 rival, UCP Leader Jason Kenney, said he would support as long as Ottawa
 also puts money on the table.</p>

 SACHEDINA: Hello everyone, and welcome to "Power Play" for Friday, 
April 6th, the day when of fears of a US trade war with China sent the 
Dow plunging more than 500 points to the end week. More on that in just a
 moment. Coming up on the show, we'll talk to federal Conservative 
leader Andrew Scheer about trade tensions between Canada and the US, and
 his new demand that he will only accept a private classified briefing 
about the prime minister's trip to India after MPs get an unclassified 
one first. Also ahead, the prime minister's trip to Canada's oil 
heartland and how successful he was in winning over those who say his 
leadership on the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b> expansion has been 
weak. And mega millionaire Kevin O'Leary talks to us about the money 
troubles stemming from his failed Conservative campaign bid. But first, a
 steep sell-off on the markets today after Donald Trump threatens China 
with an additional $100 billion in new tariffs, but the US's trading 
relationship with Canada and Mexico was also in the spotlight today. 
With his take on how <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> talks are 
going, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer joins me now. Mr. Scheer, it's 
great to have you on. I want to play a clip of the prime minister who 
was in Fort McMurray today and then get your reaction on that if we can.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
JUSTIN TRUDEAU (Canadian Prime Minister): We're pleased at the amount of
 chapters that have been closed, at the progress that has been made on a
 number of issues, but we're going to keep going and demonstrate that we
 take this issue very seriously. We'll continue to defend Canadian jobs,
 but we're hopeful to get positive news in the coming times. We're going
 to accept a good deal for Canada, not just any old deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: There is word 
that there may be an agreement in principle they may be ready to sign 
and approve at the Summit of the Americas next week. Can you at least 
give the government credit for coming as far as they have?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
ANDREW SCHEER (Conservative Leader): Well I'll give the government 
credit in the sense that dealing with President Trump on trade is no 
easy task. Usually you have a president that has a philosophical 
approach, either a free marketer or a protectionist, and you can kind of
 see that applied across. Mr. Trump seems to have a sector-by-sector 
approach all through the lens as to whether or not the US has a trade 
surplus or deficit in each specific commodity, which is not a 
conventional way to adopt that. We've been critical of the Liberal 
response early on. We think that they were late to the game in building 
the alliances throughout the US that we needed to build to get American 
pressure on the US administration. That started to happen recently, but 
we would have liked to have seen it earlier. We've been supportive of 
the government's efforts. I led a Conservative delegation down to 
Washington to show that united front. We want to help. We want Canada to
 get the very best deal that we can. It's so important. It transcends 
political lines. Encouraged to see the focus on actual market access and
 trade. You'll remember the Liberals were trying to bring in a lot of 
social policy into the negotiations, that didn't seem to go well. We 
hear a lot of talk that they've now pulled back from that and are 
focusing more on the economics and the reduction of trade barriers. 
We'll have to wait and see what comes out, though. No one has any 
details on specifics. We don't know if this is a general agreement with 
not a lot of details, or if this is a more substantial conclusion. We'll
 have more to say once we know what's in the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: One of the 
issues that you have not been supportive of is the government's plan 
when it comes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. You have spoken out 
strongly about the carbon tax, and this was one of the issues that has 
come up during the prime minister's tour of western Canada. First of 
all, do you believe that global warming is manmade? SCHEER: I believe 
that human beings absolutely have an impact on climate change. I believe
 that human beings emit all kinds of things into our environment that we
 need to address, that we need to reduce what we do emit into the 
environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: So if it's not
 a carbon tax, I haven't heard you talk much about what your plan is to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. SCHEER: Well keep in mind that the 
previous Conservative government actually reduced emissions without a 
carbon tax. We did that through incentivizing efficiencies, with, in 
encouraging people to, all kinds of things, from retrofitting their 
homes to regulating emissions on a sector-by-sector approach. I believe 
it's possible. But I'd like to flip this around a little bit, because 
here we have the environment minister and the prime minister both not 
being able to say how much the carbon tax will reduce emissions by. They
 were asked point blank questions, the minister of environment at 
committee, Justin Trudeau by myself in question period, I asked him by 
how much will emissions go down with a carbon tax. They don't have an 
answer. So I would challenge them to say what is the proof that the 
carbon tax actually works? Canadians don't support it. It hasn't given 
us the so-called <b>social license</b> to get important energy projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: But there are 
targets that Canada has signed on to in the Paris accord. So if you were
 to be prime minister after next year's election, is that an accord that
 you would stay in, or would you withdraw from that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: Well, we voted in
 favour of the motion upholding the Paris accord targets. I would also 
point out that after campaigning against the Conservative targets for 
reductions of greenhouse emissions, Justin Trudeau went to Paris and 
signed on to the exact same targets the Conservatives were proposing. So
 he's adopted our approach on this. But one thing that's not our 
approach is a carbon tax. I'm against it. I will repeal it. I don't 
believe it will reduce emissions. I think there's a more positive way to
 incentivize people and companies to reduce emissions without just 
grabbing more money from the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: I want to talk
 a little bit about the Atwal affair and switch gears. Today you are now
 saying that you will not accept this private classified briefing until 
MPs get one that's unclassified. Is there a danger here? Are you worried
 that you're overplaying your hand? I mean you know there's a filibuster
 in the house. MPs were up for a long time. You can basically just claim
 victory and walk away. Why this new demand now? SCHEER: It's not a new 
demand. When you look at the letter that I sent the clerk of the Privy 
Council, it was saying, look, we'll have a briefing, and we'll have it 
all together, and we'll go through all the publicly available 
information that can be disseminated publicly, and then anything 
classified I will stay and receive that. In a counter response, the 
clerk, Daniel Jean, has effectively indicated he'd be willing to go to 
committee. The reason why I'm concerned about this is because just a few
 weeks ago, Justin Trudeau used his majority on that committee, on the 
very committee that now Daniel jean is offering to go in front of, used 
his majority to vote against inviting him to committee. So their track 
record on this is not one that I have a lot of confidence in. They voted
 against the motion to invite him to testify. They put their MPs through
 20 hours of a marathon vote in order to avoid the very thing that now 
we're seeing. So all I've said to the Privy Council office is, great, 
happy to have a classified briefing, let me know when the public 
briefing takes place and then we can work on a date after that. I 
believe it's so important. Why the cover-up? Why they're going to such 
great lengths to avoid what was already told to reporters and 
journalists being told to parliament. We have conflicting information. 
Ralph Goodale , the minister of public safety, says that if we want to 
know information we can read it all in the media because it's all been 
reported, and then we have journalists who were on the call, on that 
conference call saying, no, no, we were told not to report some things. 
So there's, someone is not saying something that's true, and we want to 
get to the bottom of this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: So walk me through this. When will that briefing happen with you, and when will it happen with the committee?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: Well, as, my 
understanding is that Mr. Jean has reached out to the chair of the 
committee, the Liberal chair. We want that to happen very quickly. We 
want Liberals on that committee to support the idea of having a public 
hearing on this. We understand that there are some things that the 
national security advisor would know that's classified that can't be 
said in a public forum. That's fine. And he can instruct the committee 
as to when that happens. But everything that was said to journalists and
 reporters, I believe it's only right that the Canadian people have 
their elected representatives hear the same thing. After that I will 
very quickly find the right time to have that briefing on the classified
 side as was offered to me. I think that's important too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: I also want to
 get your reaction. We know that Rob Ford , who is vying to be Ontario's
 premier, is not going to have a campaign bus for journalists. What's 
your reaction to that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: I really don't have one. I don't know the logistics of running.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: Surely you must be able to say something about that. Do you support the idea or not?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: Look, every 
individual campaign will come up with their own media strategy. I have a
 media plan myself. I try to be as accessible as I can and speak to 
journalists when they're covering topics that they want to hear my voice
 on. We'll have our own plan for the federal campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: But this is a 
guy, if you're prime minister, you might have to work alongside. Can you
 say, you have talked about the role of the media, you know the previous
 Conservative government had somewhat of a fractious relationship with 
the media. Do you endorse Mr. Ford's...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: I really don't 
have views on how other people run their campaigns. When I ran for the 
leadership I had my own plan, I was often asked to comment on other 
people's style or other people's camps. I do my own thing. I run my own 
campaign. I'll be happy to work with the next premier of Ontario on 
issues. Hopefully it's a Conservative premier who wants to repeal the 
carbon tax, who wants to balance the budget and lower taxes. We'll work 
together on issues. I'm not going to weigh in on how he runs his 
campaign, whether or not he has a media bus or prints certain types of 
flyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: Then let me 
ask you this. Are journalists going to be allowed on your campaign bus 
in the campaign next year and on the plane?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEER: You know what, we
 haven't actually got to the point where we know exactly what we're 
doing in terms of buses and planes, but we'll have a healthy contingent 
of media officials at our events. It's important that I get my message 
out to as many people as I can, and of course the traditional media will
 be important, as will new media, as will new platforms to communicate 
to Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACHEDINA: All right, Mr. Scheer, great having you on. Thanks so much for joining us today. SCHEER: Thank you very much.</p>

 (“Questerre” or the “Company”) (TSX:QEC) (OSE:QEC) reported on the 
progress of the internal feasibility study for its oil shale project in 
Jordan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company has recently engaged <span class="companylink">Hatch Ltd</span>.
 (“Hatch”), a global engineering firm, to integrate and support its 
internal work on the technical and economic feasibility of this project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “This
 is an important milestone. Our preliminary feasibility work has been 
completed. It has not identified any red flags or unexpected technical 
challenges. It also suggests this project could be economic at today’s 
oil prices. We are looking forward to the results of the Hatch 
integration study later this summer to endorse our internal work.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commenting on next steps 
Mr. Binnion added, “Depending on the results of this integration study, 
we would move to pre-FEED engineering. These results and the subsequent 
pre-FEED and FEED engineering will form part of the proposed work 
program for the pre-development phase of a future concession agreement 
with the Jordanian government.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, the 
Company completed a review of the last of its nine studies covering all 
four aspects of the production of crude oil from its project in Jordan. 
These include mining and feed preparation, retorting, power, including 
utilities and infrastructure, and marketing and refining. The studies 
were completed by independent engineering firms including Hatch to 
develop technical and cost-effective solutions for these processes. Due 
to the size of the existing Jordanian refining infrastructure and the 
market for crude products in Jordan, the Company has included the costs 
to upgrade the produced crude oil to finished products including 
gasoline and diesel. Hatch completed four of the nine studies and will 
integrate all the studies into an independent assessment. The design 
basis for this assessment will be an initial project capable of 
sustaining production of 50,000 bbls/d.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The feasibility study 
follows the assessment of the oil shale resource completed by an 
independent qualified resource evaluator, Millcreek Mining Group, in 
accordance with National Instrument 51-101 – Standards of Disclosure for
 Oil and Gas Activities of the Canadian Securities Administrators (“NI 
51-101”) and the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook (“COGE 
Handbook”) (the “Resource Assessment”). The Resource Assessment 
estimates a best estimate of Discovered Petroleum Initially In Place 
(“DPIIP”) of between 7.8 billion and 12.2 billion barrels. The Resource 
Assessment was prepared in accordance with NI 51-101 and the COGE 
Handbook with an effective date of October 1, 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DPIIP was the most 
specific assignable category of resources at the time of the Resource 
Assessment given the preliminary nature of the Resource Assessment, the 
nature of recovery of the hydrocarbons by means of mining and retorting 
and that a program of work to determine commercial viability using 
established technology had not yet been completed. In addition, as a 
result of the preliminary nature of the Resource Assessment, it did not 
contain any estimates regarding the timing or cost to obtain commercial 
development. The accuracy of resource estimates is, in part, a function 
of the quality and quantity of available data and of engineering and 
geological interpretation and judgment. Given the data available at the 
time the Resource Assessment was prepared, the estimates presented 
therein are considered reasonable. The availability of additional data 
and analysis, after the date of the estimates, may necessitate 
revisions. These revisions may be material. There is no certainty that 
any portion of the resources will be discovered. If discovered, there is
 no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion
 of the resources.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advisory Regarding Forward-Looking Statements</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This news release 
contains certain statements which constitute forward-looking statements 
or information (“forward-looking statements”) including the discovery of
 resources in respect of the Jordan oil shale project and the commercial
 viability of producing any resources so discovered, the Company’s 
opinion that its preliminary feasibility work has not identified any 
unexpected technical challenges, that preliminary feasibility work 
suggests the project could be economic at current oil prices, the 
Company’s expectations of the timing and results from the Hatch 
integration study, the timing and decision to proceed to pre-FEED and 
FEED engineering, the Company’s plans to include this in the 
pre-development phase of a future concession agreement with the 
Jordanian government and its plans to apply for this concession 
agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forward-looking 
statements are based on a number of material factors, expectations or 
assumptions of Questerre which have been used to develop such statements
 and information, but which may prove to be incorrect. Although 
Questerre believes that the expectations reflected in these 
forward-looking statements are reasonable, undue reliance should not be 
placed on them because Questerre can give no assurance that they will 
prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements address future 
events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks 
and uncertainties. The Company choose to base their study on a 50,000 
barrel per day project, as that is the amount of production required to 
justify the cost of upgrading the product produced by the Company, such 
cost being factored into such feasibility study. There is nothing to 
indicate that this level of production will actually be achieved in 
respect of the Jordan oil shale project, as there is no history of 
production and no reserves have been attributed to such property. 
Although the Company believes that this assumption is reasonable in 
light of the current information available to it at this time, there is a
 significant risk that such level of production will not be achieved and
 that the estimated total capital and operating costs set forth above 
will not be achieved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further, events or 
circumstances may cause actual results to differ materially from those 
predicted as a result of numerous known and unknown risks, 
uncertainties, and other factors, many of which are beyond the control 
of the Company, including, without limitation: whether the Company's 
exploration and development activities respecting its prospects will be 
successful or that material volumes of petroleum and natural gas 
reserves will be encountered, or if encountered can be produced on a 
commercial basis; the ultimate size and scope of any hydrocarbon bearing
 formations on its lands; that drilling operations on its lands will be 
successful such that further development activities in these areas are 
warranted; that Questerre will continue to conduct its operations in a 
manner consistent with past operations; results from drilling and 
development activities will be consistent with past operations; the 
general stability of the economic and political environment in which 
Questerre operates; drilling results; field production rates and decline
 rates; the general continuance of current industry conditions; the 
timing and cost of <b>pipeline</b>, storage and facility construction 
and expansion and the ability of Questerre to secure adequate product 
transportation; future commodity prices; currency, exchange and interest
 rates; regulatory framework regarding royalties, taxes and 
environmental matters in the jurisdictions in which Questerre operates; 
and the ability of Questerre to successfully market its oil and natural

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resource Definitions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resources encompasses all
 petroleum quantities that originally existed on or within the earth's 
crust in naturally occurring accumulations, including Discovered and 
Undiscovered (recoverable and unrecoverable) plus quantities already 
produced. "Total resources" is equivalent to "Total Petroleum Initially 
In Place". Resources are classified in the following categories:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total Petroleum Initially
 In Place ("TPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is estimated to 
exist originally in naturally occurring accumulations. It includes that 
quantity of petroleum that is estimated, as of a given date, to be 
contained in known accumulations, prior to production, plus those 
estimated quantities in accumulations yet to be discovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovered Petroleum 
Initially In Place ("DPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is 
estimated, as of a given date, to be contained in known accumulations 
prior to production. The recoverable portion of discovered petroleum 
initially in place includes production, reserves, and Contingent 
Resources; the remainder is unrecoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources are 
those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established 
technology or technology under development but which are not currently 
considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more 
contingencies. Economic Contingent Resources (“ECR”) are those 
contingent resources that are currently economically recoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undiscovered Petroleum 
Initially In Place ("UPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is 
estimated, on a given date, to be contained in accumulations yet to be 
discovered. The recoverable portion of undiscovered petroleum initially 
in place is referred to as "prospective resources" and the remainder as 
"unrecoverable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective Resources are
 those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application 
of future development projects. Prospective resources have both an 
associated chance of discovery and a chance of development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unrecoverable is that 
portion of DPIIP and UPIIP quantities which is estimated, as of a given 
date, not to be recoverable by future development projects. A portion of
 these quantities may become recoverable in the future as commercial 
circumstances change or technological developments occur; the remaining 
portion may never be recovered due to the physical/chemical constraints 
represented by subsurface interaction of fluids and reservoir rocks. 
Uncertainty Ranges are described by the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation 
Handbook as low, best, and high estimates for reserves and resources as 
follows:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low Estimate: This is 
considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities
 recovered will exceed the low estimate. If probabilistic methods are 
used, there should be at least a 90 percent probability (P90) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the low estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best Estimate: This is 
considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will actually be
 recovered. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities 
recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate. If 
probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50 percent 
probability (P50) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or 
exceed the best estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High Estimate: This is 
considered to be an optimistic estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual remaining 
quantities recovered will exceed the high estimate. If probabilistic 
methods are used, there should be at least a 10 percent probability 
(P10) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the 
high estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certain resource estimate
 volumes disclosed herein are arithmetic sums of multiple estimates of 
DPIIP, which statistical principles indicate may be misleading as to 
volumes that may actually be recovered. Readers should give attention to
 the estimates of individual classes of resources and appreciate the 
differing probabilities of recovery associated with each class as 
explained under this Resource Definitions section.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's
 New Democratic government introduced its 2018-19 budget last week, and 
it is likely to be a pivotal moment for the grand and indubitably noble 
cause of democratic socialism, or social democracy, or whatever we're 
calling it now, in Alberta. Our next provincial election is supposed to 
happen, by statute, next spring - "on or before" May 31. If that is how 
things pan out, the New Democrats will get to introduce, and in theory 
run behind, an election budget. But in the meantime, a full year of 
campaigning will have taken place, and will have been conducted on the 
basis of last week's budget.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One
 of the key themes will be carbon taxation. In arguments about the 
Alberta carbon tax, the design of the actual instrument has mostly been 
beside the point until now. The whole idea of taxing carbon, as such, 
strikes at the heart of Alberta's cultural self-identification: to many 
Albertans, raised on tales of Leduc No. 1 and the National Energy 
Program and the Heritage Fund, it is morally offensive in itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta is about 
hydrocarbons in sort of the same deep sense in which Quebec can be 
thought of as being "about" the French language. An Alberta carbon tax 
(a pioneering, world-leading one!) was always going to play, with large 
Alberta audiences, as an act of hysterical self-mortification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP had to know that 
there would be an inherent political price to be paid for its approach -
 that its carbon policy would, for some Albertans, be altogether beyond 
rational discussion. But nobody should underestimate the number of 
Albertans who are at the far opposite end of this spectrum - equally 
beyond reason in the other direction. A lot of Albertans hate that 
Alberta is about hydrocarbons: they go about in a state of constant 
low-level eco-spleen. Almost certainly the business of 
hydrocarbon-digging brought their parents here, or their grandparents, 
but they have grown up with endless propaganda about the 
species'planet-killing error of ever using fossil fuels, and they 
naturally feel trapped or swindled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP's carbon tax 
rhetoric was designed to appeal to those who lie between these two poles
 of irrationality. The United Conservatives have already spent a lot of 
time heckling the New Democrats over their implied promise that a carbon
 tax would provide <b>social license</b> for <b>pipeline</b> projects 
that might help Alberta realize un-discounted world prices for 
ecologically laundered oil. The preferred rebuttal of carbon tax 
advocates is that "<b>social license</b>" is actually oil-industry 
jargon. But there can be no doubt that the carbon tax was designed, and 
politically marketed, on the basis of reputational benefits that have 
not yet panned out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Rachel Notley has talked a pretty good game about Alberta deserving to 
benefit from appropriately taxed carbon-grubbing, but the UCP can show 
that her caucus and her braintrust are full of former Splenetics who 
used to wave handmade protest signs about Dirty Oil. The fallback 
argument, for the NDP, is that the carbon tax is a worthwhile incentive 
in itself. The point is not merely to hoover up new revenue, but simply 
to price, and thereby discourage, carbon pollution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be useful for 
the NDP to show, in making this argument, that the tax was wholly 
revenue-neutral - that it was not being used to increase the size of 
government, but was being given back to Albertans. The 2018-19 budget 
makes that part of the case more complicated for them. Under the new 
implied provincial price of $30 per ton of carbon emitted, the revenues 
from carbon taxation are expected to come to about $1.4 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only $525 million of that
 will be handed back to Alberta taxpayers directly, in rebate cheques to
 lower-income households. The government intends to spend more than 
what's left over from that revenue - over a billion dollars - on 
carbonabatement projects under the Climate Leadership Plan. Close to 
half will go to public transit and other public infrastructure; over 
$200 million will be used to support coal towns being annihilated by the
 decarbonization of Alberta electricity; some of it will go to favoured 
"clean tech" researchers and businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New Democratic 
narrative will be that this should not really count as a tax grab, 
because the money, having most definitely been grabbed, is to be 
"reinvested" within Alberta. But if the most important point of the 
carbon tax was the price incentive, the NDP could have cut other taxes 
to make it truly revenue-neutral. It could even have provided a bigger, 
even more progressive cash rebate that wasn't a mere fraction of the 
revenue yield. (Mind you, I am aware of no leftist radical anywhere who 
is criticizing the Alberta carbon tax on this basis.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's worse, the federal
 government's umbrella carbon tax plan will increase the implied carbon 
price to $40 a ton in 2021, while passing the money along to Alberta, 
and the NDP's fiscal plan admits that, if it is still in charge, it will
 keep the additional money for use in "general revenue." If you're a 
middle-ground Albertan who is comfortable with a carbon tax as a 
concept, what do you have left to say to anyone who warned that such a 
tax could easily be increased, and might become another way of stiffing 
the taxpayer and increasing government expenditure? This is a surrender 
of moral high ground to essentially religious procarbon sentiment: those
 zanies, it seems, warned us of a millennium that is arriving fast.</p>

 River Mirror -- An enthusiastic group of around 20 environmental 
advocates gathered Friday at the constituency office of North 
Island–Powell River MP Rachel Blaney and North Island MLA Claire Trevena
 in solidarity with the rest of the protests happening across the 
country in opposition to Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b> expansion project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm a grandma," says 
protest organizer Sulyn Cedar. "I have five grandchildren and I want to 
protect the water for them and everyone else's children. This <b>pipeline</b> is a bad idea. In order to meet our climate change goals, we cannot continue to use fossil fuels. Period."</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project being opposed, Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b> expansion, is expected to triple the capacity of the <b>pipeline</b>,
 which could see oil-carrying vessels in the Strait of Georgia go from 
eight per month to as many as 37. Over 50 protests were registered on 
leadnow.org scheduled for March 23 at various MP offices around the 
province, as well as at the site of the expansion project in Burnaby, 
where Green Party leader Elizabeth May was 
arrested[https://www.campbellrivermirror.com/news/greens-elizabeth-may-ndps-kennedy-stewart-join-b-c-anti-pipeline-protest/].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a line," says 
Cedar. "There's a line that's not even in the sand anymore. It's in the 
fricken mud. We can't cross it anymore. Yes, we need jobs for people, 
but we need good, sustainable jobs in renewable resources. To keep using
 these fossil fuels, and expanding their use, isn't the right way to 
provide them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cedar says the fact that projects like the Kinder Morgan <b>pipeline</b> expansion and Site C Dam Project keep getting approved show us that we're not taking the health of our planet seriously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It makes no sense to me 
that all these things are continuing when they are polluting and 
destroying our Earth," Cedar says. "In terms of full-cost economics – 
because we don't calculate the cost of pollution, we continue on with 
the status quo – It makes no sense. It makes no eco-logic."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the protest, 
Cedar and the other protesters delivered jars of water to Blaney's 
office, "representing the fact that we have to take care of it and stand
 for what is right before it's too late," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blaney was not at the 
constituency office Friday, but those jars were received on her behalf 
by constituency assistant Lucas Schuller, who says he also delivered a 
statement on Blaney's behalf in support of the protester's efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Kinder Morgan 
expansion was given federal approval through a review process that the 
Trudeau government acknowledged was flawed, yet have refused to fix," 
the statement reads. "Our communities have legitimate environmental 
concerns that have not been addressed. Without <b>social license</b>, 
without meeting the commitments of the UN Declaration of Rights of 
Indigenous peoples, this project should not have been approved. We will 
continue to stand with those who fight for our coast."</p>

 throne speech that marked the opening of the legislature earlier this 
month was clearly aimed at more than just Albertans. One of its key 
themes was the need to get our oil to tidewater, where it will fetch a 
higher price than fuel sold to the United States, which is where the 
great majority of our energy is exported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The speech, read by 
Lt.-Gov. Lois Mitchell, had British Columbians in mind; in particular, 
Premier John Horgan, who has voiced strong opposition to the Trans 
Mountain <b>pipeline</b>.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The
 dispute British Columbia triggered with its attack on Canadian workers 
will not stand," the government said in the speech. "We won't let it. We
 have been vigilant in defending our workers and we will remain 
vigilant."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a well-crafted 
message, but when the government's budget is released Thursday 
afternoon, the Rachel Notley government must ensure Albertans' interests
 are at the heart of its fiscal blueprint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since coming to power in 
2015, the NPD has posted irresponsible deficits. Its predecessor, the 
Conservative party, also failed to balance the books under successive 
premiers, but there was nothing like the NDP has done in the supposed 
defence of front-line services such as health care and education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP has spent 
taxpayer money with abandon, to the point that credit agencies, which 
determine how much Albertans will pay in interest on the massive amount 
of borrowing, have downgraded the province's rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP is clearly an 
ally of the organized labour movement, but it needs to expand its reach 
and popularity if it hopes to win reelection next spring. Many Albertans
 are seeking some financial prudence as opposed to the spending 
free-for-all we've been witness to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worryingly, that's not 
likely to be the case when Thursday's budget is revealed. Finance 
Minister Joe Ceci said Tuesday that the document will include 
anticipated revenue from expansion of the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b>, apparently with the aim of balancing the budget within five years - well after the next election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No sensible homeowner 
would cobble together a budget with the assumption they'd be getting a 
pay increase in a few years. And yet this is what passes for NDP 
mathematics - the hope that having imposed a punitive carbon tax on its 
citizens to win so-called <b>social license</b> for pipelines, that 
politicians who are indifferent to energy infrastructure, or openly 
oppose them, are going to facilitate the flow of billions of dollars 
into Alberta's coffers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP have proven to be
 poor money managers, but surely we're not to have faith in such wild 
speculation. Opposition Leader Jason Kenney sees the danger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We obviously hope that 
Trans Mountain gets built quickly, but what we've seen is a year of 
delays already and the very strong potential of yet further delays," 
said the United Conservative Party leader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is putting a lot of eggs in one uncertain basket, and that's not how you budget."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government should 
focus instead on reducing costs. Last year's budget projected that by 
2020, Alberta's debt will be $70 billion - which is the equivalent of 
$16,500 for every person in the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists Janice 
MacKinnon and Jack Mintz argue that Alberta can learn lessons from other
 provinces, such as Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia, which spent an
 average of $9,233 per capita last year on services. Alberta spent 
$12,409 per person - that's $3,176 more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In health care alone, 
they note, Alberta spends $915 more per capita than the average of the 
other three large provinces, which means spending $3.8 billion more 
annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP shouldn't put 
revenue from incompleted pipelines in its ledgers. It should engage in 
the thoughtful work Albertans elected them to do and focus on reducing 
expenses.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there's one thing I 
hope all Albertans can agree on, it's the desperate need for more 
pipelines to get our abundant oil and gas resources to market. According
 to recent reports, Alberta is losing $7 billion per year because of 
lack of <b>pipeline</b> capacity, with industry losing $6.7 billion more annually.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While
 we disagree with how the NDP has handled the strategy surrounding the 
Trans Mountain expansion, we don't doubt the need for the <b>pipeline</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't that long ago 
when pipelines were built in this country with little controversy. Under
 the previous Harper government, four major <b>pipeline</b> projects 
were completed. Keystone, Alberta Clipper, the Line 9 reversal and 
Anchor Loop were all successfully completed under the previous 
government, adding 1.73 million barrels per day of capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, it is true that none
 of these projects were to tidewater, as the NDP is happy to point out. 
But Trans Mountain was not up for government approval under the previous
 Conservative government. The NDP's cousins in Ottawa would no doubt 
have howled with outrage if the Harper government dared to short circuit
 the regulatory process by approving a <b>pipeline</b> before a thorough review was completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northern Gateway, the one tidewater <b>pipeline</b>
 up for decision under the Harper Conservatives, was indeed approved. 
Sadly, the project was retroactively cancelled by the Trudeau Liberals 
as part of their plan to ban tanker traffic off B.C.'s northern coast 
(never mind that Alaskan tankers have travelled down that route for 
decades). And the Trudeau Liberals later rigged the approval process 
midstream to scuttle Energy East, another <b>pipeline</b> to tidewater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, radical 
activists have engaged in a concerted effort to specifically target and 
sideline Canada's oil and gas industry, viewing us as ripe for the 
picking. Millions of dollars of foreign funding have flooded into the 
Canadian environmental movement with the clear goal of starving our 
resources of markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta NDP government promised that imposing a carbon tax on Albertans would buy so-called <b>social license</b> in B.C. for a <b>pipeline</b>
 to the Pacific. We are baffled that the Alberta government bought this 
specious argument, since it's their fellow travellers - both the B.C. 
NDP and radical environmental activists such as Tzeporah Berman - who 
are leading the fight against the approved Trans Mountain expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surely, the Alberta NDP understood that their friends would not be willing to trade a carbon tax for a <b>pipeline</b>. In fact, Premier Rachel Notley finally acknowledged this reality in a recent interview with <span class="companylink">CBC Radio</span>. When asked why not put a hold on the carbon tax until the <b>pipeline</b> begins construction, she responded, "quite honestly, I don't know that B.C. would care one way or another if we did that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The truth is that the Trudeau Liberals provided paper regulatory approval for the <b>pipeline</b>,
 purportedly because of Alberta's willingness to impose a carbon tax on 
its citizens. Yet today, the Trudeau Liberals are willing to do little 
beyond rhetoric to fight for Trans Mountain in the face of vociferous 
opposition in B.C., hurting the 51 First Nations that have signed off in
 support of the <b>pipeline</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's in all Albertans interest to see this <b>pipeline</b>
 succeed. We in the United Conservative Party welcome the government's 
recent about face. After months mocking our suggestions to threaten the 
B.C. NDP with serious consequences, including potentially cutting off 
oil shipments and tolling B.C. natural gas, the premier has finally 
accepted our advice, albeit far too late.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We welcome a robust, serious debate on what's needed to get this <b>pipeline</b>
 built. But we should not be deluded into the fantasy that punitive 
taxes on everyday Albertans will appease the fringe yet extremely vocal 
anti-<b>pipeline</b> minority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, we must make it 
clear to the vast majority of reasonable Canadians that the success of 
our energy sector is critical for the success of our country, and that 
Alberta cannot be taken for granted any longer.</p>

Brad Wall Supports Alberta’s Hard Stance On Pipelines, But Not On Carbon Tax</span>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While
 they might be ideologically opposed on various issues, right-of-centre 
Brad Wall, former Saskatchewan premier, is in “totally support” of 
left-leaning Alberta Premier Rachel Notley’s promise to do whatever it 
takes to see the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b> expansion come to fruition, even if it means shutting off the flow of oil and gas to B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That would get a lot of 
attention, as a last resort, if the people in the province of Alberta 
said: ‘Alright, we are going to try and show you just how important 
these pipelines are to you economically, and to the quality of life for 
B.C. and for the rest of the country,’” he told a Calgary Chamber of 
Commerce luncheon event on Monday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Just as a has-been premier, I would cheer from the sidelines if it needs to be done.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, during his 
speech and onstage Q&amp;A session with W.Brett Wilson, Wall also 
emphasized differences he has with Alberta’s NDP government, as well as 
with the current federal Liberal government. The long-time head of the 
conservative <span class="companylink">Saskatchewan Party</span> 
discussed his concerns regarding what he calls the “new left,” which 
seems to place matters such as (what he considers) ineffective carbon 
pricing ahead of government’s primary concern — the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The problem with this 
carbon tax is that you’d be hard pressed to find it working to actually 
reduce emissions, absolutely, where it is implemented. In our own 
country, it has been around since 2008 in the province next door, and 
their emissions are up. Now, B.C. would say: ‘Wait a minute. The 
intensity of the emissions is down.’ But [the Paris Agreement] isn’t 
about intensity of emissions; Paris is about absolute emissions 
reductions.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall’s presentation to 
the chamber was his first public address since leaving office following a
 decade as premier. Earlier this year, the governing party chose Scott 
Moe as Saskatchewan’s new premier (DOB, Jan. 29, 2018).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Wall, 
federal documents suggest the carbon tax must reach $200 per tonne for 
Canada to meet those Paris Agreement targets. While that would reduce 
emissions, he noted, such a price would do so only with widespread 
hardship through such results as many people being unable to afford to 
drive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That’s where the emperor has no clothes. That’s the discussion we need to have.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: “Federally, in 
terms of the economy priorities, we’ve seen a carbon-based budget, we’ve
 seen a gender-based budget, but I long for the day for our country when
 we see an economy-based budget.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall asks: What is <b>social license</b>?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever “<b>social license</b>”
 means, Wall believes the energy sector paid for it long ago, and 
industry does not require a carbon tax to justify its existence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was paid for in the 
transfer payments that were supported because of [Alberta’s] economy and
 ours,” he told reporters following this week’s chamber event. “It was 
paid for in jobs for Canadians from coast to coast to coast, and the 
quality of life implications of that. That’s <b>social license</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It has been paid for in 
meaningful land partnerships with First Nations, who built 
transformational businesses and created jobs because of this sector. All
 of this sounds like <b>social license</b> to me.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall believes this 
“self-immolation of a carbon tax” — whereby Alberta and Saskatchewan 
punish themselves because of their oil and gas assets — is ineffective 
anyway. It will not win support from those who are anti-industry, he 
said, as those individuals will still support ENGOs, they will still 
vote in accordance to their pre-carbon tax views, and they will still 
pressure their governments to act in accordance with anti-industry 
sentiments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If someone from B.C. or 
some other part of the country doesn’t like the oil and gas sector, the 
fact you implement a carbon tax is not going to change that person’s 
opinion.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: “This is something that has frustrated me since the very beginning.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technology to tackle climate change</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Focus on developing 
technology rather than on carbon pricing: That is Wall’s proposed 
‘made-in-Canada’ solution to man-made climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Could we as a country 
have a ‘man-to-the-moon’ sort of approach of finding a way to lower the 
cost of what we are already doing in [Saskatchewan] in terms of clean 
coal technology? That is our experience at home. The technology works; 
we have to drive the costs down. Isn’t it more important to do that and 
perhaps provide a technological solution that would actually reduce 
emissions?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the former 
premier, there are 2,000 coal plants being built around the world, 
principally in Asia, as countries such as India strive to grow their 
economies. He suggested carbon taxation has taken hold in Canada, in 
part, because various sectors of the economy hesitated to point out that
 pricing does not reduce absolute emissions, but it does have an impact 
on jobs. He challenges Canadians to stand up against ineffective policy 
that hurts competitiveness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In our province, it 
wasn’t good enough just to say we weren’t going to have a carbon tax. We
 unveiled in the fall our action plan on climate change, and it is a 
serious plan. It’s meaningful. It includes the possibility of a levy on 
high emitters, the likes of which you have had in Alberta.”</p>

 Utica resources in Quebec, he added, “The reserve engineers updated our
 resource report from last year for their current price forecast. The 
best estimate of risked contingent resources net to Questerre for the 
Becancour and Lotbiniere project areas is unchanged at 214 Bcf. These 
project areas as assessed only cover 5% of our total acreage. The risked

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">December 31, 2017 Quebec Resource Information</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questerre also reported on the year-end update prepared by <span class="companylink">GLJ Petroleum Consultants Ltd</span>.
 (“GLJ”) to the independent resource assessment of its 735,910 gross 
(190,800 net) acres in the St. Lawrence Lowlands Quebec that have 
potential for the Upper Utica Shale effective December 31, 2017 in a 
report dated March 5, 2018 (the “GLJ Resource Assessment”). The GLJ 
Resource Assessment was prepared in accordance with NI 51-101 and the 
standards contained in the COGE Handbook. The GLJ Resource Assessment 
did not include any of the Corporation’s other properties. All 
anticipated results disclosed herein were prepared by GLJ, which is an 
independent qualified reserves evaluator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GLJ used probabilistic 
methods to generate low, best and high estimates of total petroleum 
initially in-place ("TPIIP"), both discovered and undiscovered. 
Recoverable Contingent and Prospective Resources over Questerre's 
acreage were estimated by analogy and based on available well data over 
the Quebec Utica and public data from US Utica and Marcellus shale 
plays. The evaluation consisted of the Upper Utica which includes the 
Indian Castle and Dolgeville members as well as the Flat Creek. The Flat
 Creek, the lower most member, was only evaluated to estimate 
undiscovered petroleum initially-in-place ("UPIIP"). No recoverable 
resources were assigned to the Flat Creek given the lack of test data 
showing established technology can support commercial development at 
this time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GLJ Resource 
Assessment is based on the results from several vertical and horizontal 
wells on the Questerre’s acreage that have all encountered pay in the 
Utica. Test data from these wells in conjunction with offset development
 and studies of the analogous US Utica supports the prospective 
commercial development of these resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Significant positive 
factors relevant to the estimate of Questerre’s resources include the 
importation of all natural gas consumed in Quebec creating demand for 
local production, premium realized pricing due to the transportation 
costs associated with importing natural gas for consumption, production 
test data from Questerre’s existing wells and the development of the 
analogous Utica shale in the United States. Significant negative factors
 include the limited number of wells on Questerre’s acreage, lack of a 
developed service sector providing uncertainty regarding estimates of 
capital and operating costs, developing hydrocarbon regulations and 
environmental legislation and the requirement to obtain social 
acceptability for oil and gas operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Questerre believes 
it will have sufficient financial capability to fund its share of costs 
associated with the development program in the GLJ Resource Assessment, 
it may not have access to the necessary capital when required. 
Conducting the development program is also dependent on the 
participation by Questerre’s joint venture partners. There is no 
guarantee that they will elect to participate in the program to the 
extent required. Questerre retains the right to conduct activities 
without the operators’ participation on an independent operations basis 
whereby it can fund 100% of the capital costs for certain well 
operations and facilities in return for net revenue equal to 400% of its
 capital investment before the operators can elect to either remain in a
 penalty position or hold a working interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The TPIIP was determined 
probabilistically on a permit basis with estimates of 45 to 145 Bcf per 
square mile for the Upper Utica. This compares favorably to analogous US
 shale plays with estimates of the Utica in Ohio at between 35 to 85 Bcf
 per square mile and 25 to 150 Bcf per square mile for the Marcellus 
shale in Pennsylvania. Of the TPIIP estimated over Questerre’s acreage, 
only land within a 3 mile radius of a successfully tested well was 
quantified as discovered gas-in-place. Based on this qualification only 
16% of the total mapped TPIIP in the Upper Utica was considered 
discovered Contingent Resource.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Upper Utica was 
considered undiscovered for approximately 84% of the total mapped TPIIP.
 Recovery factors of 18%, 26% and 37% were applied to the low, best and 
high estimates resource cases respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Summary information 
regarding contingent resources and net present value of future net 
revenues from contingent resources are set forth below and are derived, 
in each case, from the GLJ Resource Assessment. All contingent resources
 evaluated in the GLJ Resource Assessment were deemed economic at the 
effective date of December 31, 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questerre’s average 
working interest in its gross best estimate Contingent Resources is 
25.9%. In addition to Questerre’s working interest, the Company also 
holds a royalty interest in the acreage and associated resources. As a 
result, in some cases Questerre’s net volumes (after royalties) exceed 
its working interest volumes. For clarity, included in the following 
tables are Questerre’s volume before royalties, gross working interest 
volumes and net volumes after royalties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A range of contingent 
resources estimates (low, best and high) were prepared by GLJ. See notes
 5 to 7 of the tables below for a description of low estimate, best 
estimate and high estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GLJ Resources 
Assessment estimated gross risked contingent resources with a project 
maturity subclass of development on hold of 18.6 million boe (low 
estimate) to 50.0 million boe (high estimate), with a best estimate of 
30.4 million boe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GLJ Resources 
Assessment estimated gross risked contingent resources with a project 
maturity subclass of development unclarified of 8.9 million boe (low 
estimate) to 23.8 million boe (high estimate), with a best estimate of 
14.6 million boe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estimate of risked net
 present value of future net revenue of contingent resources is 
preliminary in nature and is provided to assist the reader in reaching 
an opinion on the merit and likelihood of the Company proceeding with 
the required investment. It includes contingent resources that are 
considered too uncertain with respect to the chance of development to be
 classified as reserves. There is uncertainty that the risked net 
present value of future net revenue will be realized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent resources can 
be sub-classified based on their project maturity sub-class which help 
identify a project’s change of commerciality. The project maturity 
subclasses for contingent resources are “development pending”, 
“development on hold”, “development unclarified” or “development not 
viable”, all as defined in the COGE Handbook. “Development pending” is 
when resolution of the final conditions for development is being 
actively pursued (high chance of development). “Development on hold” is 
when there is a reasonable chance of development, but there are major 
non-technical contingencies to be resolved that are usually beyond the 
control of the operator. “Development unclarified” is when the 
evaluation is incomplete and there is ongoing activity to resolve any 
risks or uncertainties. “Development not viable” is when no further data
 acquisition or evaluation is currently planned and hence there is a low
 chance of development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those areas classified as
 development on hold are primarily contingent on the passage of 
applicable hydrocarbon and environmental legislation and regulations as 
well as local acceptability. Remaining areas classified as development 
unclarified have additional contingency or risk associated with securing
 <b>social license</b> to operate and are thereby a lower priority for 
development. Additional contingencies include firm development plans, 
detailed cost estimates and corporate approvals and sanctioning. There 
is no certainty that any portion of the Contingent Resources will be 
economic to develop. Though pilot horizontal development plans have been
 proposed, the project evaluation scenario for the Contingent Resources 
is not sufficiently defined to make an investment decision to proceed to
 development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources are 
evaluated based on the same fiscal conditions used in the assessment of 
reserves, and as such, are forecasted to be economic. Contingent 
Resource values are estimated on the basis of established technology, 
namely multistage hydraulic fracturing recovery technologies that are 
widely used in the development of shale gas plays including in the 
Montney in Canada and the Utica formation in Ohio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chance of 
commerciality for Contingent Resources is equal to the product of the 
chance of discovery and the chance of development. “Chance of discovery”
 is the estimated probability that exploration activities will confirm 
the existence of a significant accumulation of potentially recoverable 
petroleum. “Chance of development” is the estimated probability that, 
once discovered, a known accumulation will be commercially developed. 
Based on contingencies related to the passage of applicable hydrocarbon 
and environmental legislation, regulations, local acceptability, and 
additional risk associated with securing <b>social license</b> to 
operate, firm development plans, detailed cost estimates and corporate 
approvals GLJ estimated the Chance of Development for the development 
unclarified subclass ranges between 10% and 25% as detailed in the table
 below. By definition the chance of discovery for Contingent Resource is
 100%. The corresponding chance of commerciality for the development 
unclarified subclass is therefore estimated at between 10% and 25% as 
detailed in the table below.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notes:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Contingent resources 
are defined in the COGE Handbook as those quantities of petroleum 
estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from known 
accumulations using established technology or technology under 
development, but which are not currently considered to be commercially 
recoverable due to one or more contingencies. There is no certainty that
 it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the contingent
 resources or that Questerre will produce any portion of the volumes 
currently classified as contingent resources. The estimates of 
contingent resources involve implied assessment, based on certain 
estimates and assumptions, that the resources described exists in the 
quantities predicted or estimated, as at a given date, and that the 
resources can be profitably produced in the future. The risked net 
present value of the future net revenue from the contingent resources 
does not represent the fair market value of the contingent resources. 
Actual contingent resources (and any volumes that may be reclassified as
 reserves) and future production therefrom may be greater than or less 
than the estimates provided herein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* GLJ prepared the 
estimates of contingent resources shown for each property using 
deterministic principles and methods. Probabilistic aggregation of the 
low and high property estimates shown in the table might produce 
different total volumes than the arithmetic sums shown in the table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* "Gross” contingent 
resources are Questerre's working interest (operating or non-operating) 
share before deduction of royalties and without including any royalty 
interests of Questerre. "Net” contingent resources are Questerre's 
working interest (operating or non-operating) share after deduction of 
royalty obligations, plus Questerre's royalty interests in contingent 
resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The risked net present 
value of future net revenue attributable to the contingent resources 
does not represent the fair market value of the contingent resources. 
Estimated abandonment and reclamation costs have been included in the 
evaluation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Low Estimate Contingent
 Resources are considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity 
that will actually be recovered. It is likely that the actual remaining 
quantities recovered will exceed the low estimate. If probabilistic 
methods are used, there should be at least a 90 percent probability 
(P90) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the 
low estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Best Estimate 
Contingent Resources are considered to be the best estimate of the 
quantity that will actually be recovered. It is equally likely that the 
actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the 
best estimate. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at 
least a 50 percent probability (P50) that the quantities actually 
recovered will equal or exceed the best estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* High Estimate 
Contingent Resources are considered to be an optimistic estimate of the 
quantity that will actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual
 remaining quantities recovered will exceed the high estimate. If 
probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 10 percent 
probability (P10) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or 
exceed the high estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Chance of 
Development (CoDev) is the estimated probability that, once discovered, a
 known accumulation will be commercially developed. Five factors have 
been considered in determining the CoDev as follows:CoDev = Ps (Economic
 Factor) × Ps (Technology Factor) × Ps (Development Plan Factor) ×Ps 
(Development Timeframe Factor) × Ps (Other Contingency Factor) wherein 
Ps is the probability of successEconomic Factor – For reserves to be 
assessed, a project must be economic. With respect to contingent 
resources, this factor captures uncertainty in the assessment of 
economic status principally due to uncertainty in cost estimates and 
marketing options. Economic viability uncertainty due to technology is 
more aptly captured with the Technology Factor. The Economic Factor will
 be 1 for reserves and will often be 1 for development pending projects 
and for projects with a development study or pre-development study with a
 robust rate of return. A robust rate of return means that the project 
retains economic status with variation in costs and/or marketing plans 
over the expected range of outcomes for these variables.Technology 
Factor - For reserves to be assessed, a project must utilize established
 technology. With respect to contingent resources, this factor captures 
the uncertainty in the viability of the proposed technology for the 
subject reservoir, namely, the uncertainty associated with technology 
under development. By definition, technology under development is a 
recovery process or process improvement that has been determined to be 
technically viable via field test and is being field tested further to 
determine its economic viability in the subject reservoir. The 
Technology Factor will be 1 for reserves and for established technology.
 For technology under development, this factor will consider different 
risks associated with technologies being developed at the scale of the 
well versus the scale of a project and technologies which are being 
modified or extended for the subject reservoir versus new emerging 
technologies which have not previously been applied in any commercial 
application. The risk assessment will also consider the quality and 
sufficiency of the test data available, the ability to reliably scale 
such data and the ability to extrapolate results in time.Development 
Plan Factor – For reserves to be assessed, a project must have a 
detailed development plan. With respect to contingent resources, this 
factor captures the uncertainty in the project evaluation scenario. The 
Development Plan Factor will be 1 for reserves and high, approaching 1, 
for development pending projects. This factor will consider development 
plan detail variations including the degree of delineation, reservoir 
specific development and operating strategy detail (technology decision,
 well layouts (spacing and pad locations), completion strategy, start-up
 strategy, water source and disposal, other infrastructure, facility 
design, marketing plans etc) and the quality of the cost estimates as 
provided by the developer.Development Timeframe Factor – In the case of 
major projects, for reserves to be assessed, first major capital 
spending must be initiated within 5 years of the effective date. The 
Development Timeframe Factor will be 1 for reserves and will often be 1 
for development pending projects provided the project is planned 
on-stream based on the same criteria used in the assessment of reserves.
 With respect to contingent resources, the factor will approach 1 for 
projects planned on-stream with a timeframe slightly longer than the 
limiting reserves criteria.Other Contingency Factor – For reserves to be
 assessed, all contingencies must be eliminated. With respect to 
contingent resources, this factor captures major contingencies, usually 
beyond the control of the operator, other than those captured by 
economic status, technology status, project evaluation scenario status 
and the development timeframe. The Other Contingency Factor will be 1 
for reserves and for development pending projects and less than 1 for on
 hold. Provided all contingencies have been identified and their 
resolution is reasonably certain, this factor would also be 1 for 
development unclarified projects.These factors may be inter-related 
(dependent) and care has been taken to ensure that risks are 
appropriately accounted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Contingent resources 
for the Lowlands have been estimated based the results from several 
vertical and horizontal wells on the Company’s acreage that have all 
encountered pay in the Utica. Test data from these wells in conjunction 
with offset development and studies of analogous US Utica supports the 
prospective commercial development on these resources. The estimated 
unrisked cost to bring these contingent resources on commercial 
production is $809.28 million and the expected timeline is between 2 and
 11 years. The specific contingencies for these resources are the 
passage of applicable hydrocarbon and environmental legislation, 
regulations, local acceptability, firm development plans, detailed cost 
estimates and corporate approvals and sanctioning.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Summary information 
regarding prospective resources and net present value of future net 
revenues from prospective resources are set forth below and are derived,
 in each case, from the GLJ Resources Assessment. The GLJ Resources 
Assessment was prepared in accordance with COGE Handbook and NI-51-101 
by GLJ, an independent qualified reserve evaluator. All prospective 
resources evaluated in the GLJ Resources Assessment were deemed economic
 at the effective date of December 31, 2017. Prospective resources are 
in addition to reserves estimated in the GLJ Report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Upper Utica was 
considered undiscovered for approximately 84% of the total mapped TPIIP.
 Recovery factors of 19%, 27% and 40% were applied to the low, best and 
high estimates resource cases respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A range of prospective 
resources estimates (low, best and high) were prepared by GLJ. See notes
 6 to 8 of the tables below for a description of low estimate, best 
estimate and high estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GLJ Resources 
Assessment estimated gross risked prospective resources of 87 million 
boe (low estimate) to 238 million boe (high estimate), with a best 
estimate of 143 million boe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chance of 
commerciality for Prospective Resources is equal to the product of the 
chance of discovery and the chance of development. “Chance of discovery”
 is the estimated probability that exploration activities will confirm 
the existence of a significant accumulation of potentially recoverable 
petroleum. “Chance of development” is the estimated probability that, 
once discovered, a known accumulation will be commercially developed. 
Based on contingencies related to the passage of applicable hydrocarbon 
and environmental legislation, regulations, local acceptability, and 
additional risk associated with securing <b>social license</b> to 
operate, firm development plans, detailed cost estimates and corporate 
approvals GLJ estimated the Chance of Development at 19 percent. 
Proximity to extensional and compressional-related fault systems 
presents risk of structuring resulting in leak off and reduced pressures
 in some prospective regions, additionally, lack of delineation data 
provides reservoir risk associated with uncertainty regarding reservoir 
quality and rock mechanics amicable to hydraulic fracturing. Therefore, 
GLJ has estimated the Chance of Discovery at 81 percent. The 
corresponding chance of commerciality is 15 percent. This also takes 
into account Questerre’s working interest and operatorship of its assets
 as Questerre is subject to the priorities of working interest partners 
for such assets. Production and development forecasts were not completed
 by GLJ as part of the prospective resources evaluation.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notes:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Prospective resources 
are defined in the COGE Handbook as those quantities of petroleum 
estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from 
unknown accumulations by application of future development projects. 
Prospective resources have both an associated chance of discovery 
(CoDis) and a chance of development (CoDev). There is no certainty that 
any portion of the prospective resources will be discovered. If 
discovered, there is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to
 produce any portion of the prospective resources or that Questerre will
 produce any portion of the volumes currently classified as prospective 
resources. The estimates of prospective resources involve implied 
assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the 
resources described exists in the quantities predicted or estimated, as 
at a given date, and that the resources can be profitably produced in 
the future. The risked net present value of the future net revenue from 
the prospective resources does not represent the fair market value of 
the prospective resources. Actual prospective resources (and any volumes
 that may be reclassified as reserves) and future production therefrom 
may be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* GLJ prepared the 
estimates of prospective resources shown for each property using 
deterministic principles and methods. Probabilistic aggregation of the 
low and high property estimates shown in the table might produce 
different total volumes than the arithmetic sums shown in the table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The forecast price and 
cost assumptions utilized in the year-end 2017 reserves report were also
 utilized by GLJ in preparing the GLJ Resource Assessmen</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* "Gross” prospective 
resources are Questerre’s working interest (operating or non-operating) 
share before deduction of royalties and without including any royalty 
interests of the Company. "Net” prospective resources are Questerre’s 
working interest (operating or non-operating) share after deduction of 
royalty obligations, plus Questerre’s royalty interests in prospective 
resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The risked net present 
value of future net revenue attributable to the prospective resources 
does not represent the fair market value of the prospective resources. 
Estimated abandonment and reclamation costs have been included in the 
evaluation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Low Estimate 
Prospective Resources is considered to be a conservative estimate of the
 quantity that will actually be recovered. It is likely that the actual 
net remaining quantities recovered will exceed the low estimate of 87 
million boe. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least
 a 90 percent probability (P90) that the quantities actually recovered 
will equal or exceed the low estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Best Estimate 
Prospective Resources is considered to be the best estimate of the 
quantity that will actually be recovered. It is equally likely that the 
actual net remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than 
the best estimate of 143 million. If probabilistic methods are used, 
there should be at least a 50 percent probability (P50) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the best estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The High Estimate 
Prospective Resources is considered to be an optimistic estimate of the 
quantity that will actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual
 net remaining quantities recovered will exceed the high estimate of 238
 million boe. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at 
least a 10 percent probability (P10) that the quantities actually 
recovered will equal or exceed the high estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The chance of 
commerciality is defined as the product of the chance of discovery and 
the chance of development. Chance of discovery is defined in COGE 
Handbook as the estimated probability that exploration activities will 
confirm the existence of a significant accumulation of potentially 
recoverable petroleum. Chance of development is defined as the estimated
 probability that, once discovered, a known accumulation will be 
commercially developed <span class="companylink">Questerre Energy Corporation</span>

 believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking

beyond the control of the Company, including, without limitation: 
whether the Company's exploration and development activities respecting 
its prospects will be successful or that material volumes of petroleum

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All evaluations and 
reviews of future net revenue are stated prior to any provision for 
interest costs or general and administrative costs and after the 
deduction of estimated future capital expenditures for wells to which 
reserves have been assigned. The estimated future net revenue from the 
production of disclosed oil and gas reserves does not represent the fair
 market value of the Company’s reserves. There is no assurance that such
 price and cost assumptions will be attained and variances could be 
material. The recovery and reserve estimates of crude oil, NGLs and 
natural gas reserves provided herein are estimates only and there is no 
guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered. Actual light 
and medium crude oil, shale gas and natural gas liquids reserves may be 
greater than or less than the estimates provided herein. All of the 
Company’s light and medium crude oil, shale gas and natural gas liquids 
reserves are located in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barrel of oil equivalent 
(“boe”) amounts may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A 
boe conversion ratio has been calculated using a conversion rate of six 
thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil and the 
conversion ratio of one barrel to six thousand cubic feet is based on an
 energy equivalent conversion method application at the burner tip and 
does not necessarily represent an economic value equivalent at the 
wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude
 oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the 
energy equivalent of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be 
misleading as an indication of value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estimates of reserves
 and future net revenue for individual properties may not reflect the 
same confidence level as estimates of reserves and future net revenue 
for all properties, due to the effects of aggregation.</p>

 (“Questerre” or the “Company”) (TSX:QEC) (OSE:QEC) announced today that
 it has entered into an agreement with an experienced operator to 
develop its 100% acreage in the Kakwa area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, President and Chief Executive Officer of Questerre, 
commented, “The first well at Kakwa North should spud next quarter, 
subject to rig availability. Given the strong condensate production and 
low sour content from nearby wells on our joint venture acreage we are 
looking forward to the results.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He further added, “With 
this joint venture we are developing our operated acreage and preserving
 capital primarily for Quebec. We are working on our Quebec Clean Gas 
pilot as we wait for the release of the final regulations later this 
spring.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The farm-in partner is an
 exploration and production company with extensive operating experience 
with the Montney Formation in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subject to the terms of 
the agreement, the farm-in partner has the right to drill, complete, 
equip and tie-in two horizontal wells targeting the Montney Formation to
 earn a 50% interest in certain acreage held by Questerre at Kakwa 
North. The partner has the option to drill, complete, equip and tie-in 
additional wells to earn a similar interest in other acreage held by 
Questerre at Kakwa North and Kakwa South. Questerre will hold a royalty 
interest in these initial wells and certain subsequent wells subject to 
standard payout provisions. Questerre currently holds a 100% interest in
 4,480 acres at Kakwa North along with 3,840 acres at Kakwa South and a 
25% interest in 10,240 acres on its joint venture block.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questerre also reported 
on plans for additional activity targeting its shallow mineral rights, 
above and excluding Montney rights, at Kakwa North. The Company was 
recently advised by the operator that it plans to drill up to six 
horizontal wells on this acreage in 2018. Questerre holds an overriding 
royalty interest in 4160 acres of shallow rights at Kakwa North.</p>

 Alberta never had a particular beef with B.C. wine. Unfortunately, the 
industry became collateral damage of sorts in a political war between 
the Alberta and B.C. governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Had B.C. not threatened to cause problems for the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b>
 expansion, Alberta would have had nothing to retaliate against in the 
first place. And the tit-for-tat approach of showing B.C. the effect of 
causing grief for one of their key industries was not exactly unpopular.</p>

 now, it would appear, one or both sides have blinked, and the B.C. wine
 ban has been dropped. That's a relief to the B.C. Wine Institute, which
 was set to go to court in Calgary to try and get the ban overturned. 
The industry group says the ban had a "severe impact" on wineries, with 
the potential of $4 million in losses by the end of this month had the

 shelf space denied to a Canadian product, to deny Alberta consumers the
 choice to purchase that B.C. wine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So now we revert back to 
how it was before. Back to the normal course of affairs, where the B.C. 
market for Alberta beer is for all intents and purposes unavailable. 
Where shelf space in B.C. liquor stores is denied to Alberta beer. Where
 B.C. consumers are denied the choice to purchase Alberta-produced craft
 beer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Funny, isn't it, how 
Alberta's treatment of B.C. wine is seen as punitive and B.C.'s 
treatment of Alberta beer is just how things are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta government 
has taken a lot of criticism, much of it deserved, over its own 
protectionist beer policies, including what some call a de facto tariff 
on out-of-province beer. What has received far less attention, however, 
is the extent to which other provinces - B.C. included - provide

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While <b>pipeline</b> 
politics have dominated the recent conversation, perhaps this is an 
opening to revisit the issue of protectionist liquor policies and point 
to the hypocrisy of various provincial governments. The pending Supreme 
Court decision in the Comeau case could blow this issue wide open and 
help advance the cause of breaking down these interprovincial booze 
barriers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's <span class="companylink">Big Rock Brewery</span>,
 for example, has gone so far as to open facilities in B.C. and Ontario,
 which in turn, makes it much easier for them to sell their product in 
those provinces. Beyond Big Rock, however, you'd be hard-pressed to find
 any other Alberta exports in either province. Conversely, though, there
 remains an abundance of (slightly more costly) out-of-province beer 
available across Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a lot easier for 
Alberta to have a laissez-faire attitude toward out-of-province wine, 
since we really don't have an Alberta wine industry that we're trying to
 protect. And I'm sure if B.C. didn't have its own craft beer industry, 
it probably wouldn't care all that much about allowing Alberta beer into
 B.C. liquor stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, too many 
governments remain beholden to the notion that they can grow their 
industries only through the imposition of protectionist policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As we've seen with the 
emergence of several craft beer meccas in the U.S., protectionist 
policies aren't the driving factor behind the growth in this industry. 
Here in Alberta, it was the repeal of restrictions on small breweries, 
more so than protectionist policies, that helped to spark the tremendous
 growth we've seen in our industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the lingering bitterness over the <b>pipeline</b>
 battle might spill over into the beer sector, with Alberta beer 
consumers thinking twice about selecting that B.C.-made product. Perhaps
 it's an opportunity for those consumers to discover what's being brewed
 here at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at least those consumers have the choice in the first place.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OK,
 so let me see if I've got this right: After three years of raising 
taxes on oil companies and everyone who works in the patch (plus just 
about everyone else in Alberta), after the carbon tax, a 50% increase in
 the tax on large industrial emitters, the coal shutdown, the hard cap 
on oilsands emissions and a pile of other red tape and regulations on 
the oil industry, the Notley government announces $1 billion in grants 
and loans guarantees for bitumen upgraders and we're all supposed to be 
blown away by their commitment to Alberta's energy industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By modest estimates, 
Alberta has lost between $30 billion to $35 billion in oil and gas 
investment since the NDP nightmare began in May 2015, and now the Notley
 government wants Albertans to be grateful that it is putting $1 billion
 back into the industry over eight years.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without
 doubt, much of the lost investment was due to the downturn in world oil
 prices and to the fact that we cannot get pipelines built that will 
take our oil to international markets - neither of which is the fault of
 the NDP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's not as if we are losing out to developing countries in the investment race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We certainly are losing out to places such Egypt and Kazakhstan and Tanzania.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But mostly we are losing 
out to jurisdictions that are the most like Alberta: Texas, Oklahoma, 
North Dakota. We are losing out to places where the geology and the 
financial landscapes are similar to Alberta. Often in the past, when 
they've boomed we've boomed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we are being passed 
by now, while they surge ahead, in large part because our New Democrats 
have been operating under the ridiculous belief that if we could just 
beggar ourselves with environmental regulations and taxes, we could buy "<b>social license</b>" that would cause "green" politicians and environmentalists to grant us permits to build pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And after that strategy 
has turned out to be such a spectacular failure, the NDP think Albertans
 can be bought off with an investment of $125 million a year for eight 
years to "diversify" our oil and gas sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industrial goal of 
the Notley government's diversification strategy, released Monday is 
sound. Indeed, it's clever and practical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Get a few upgraders built
 that don't fully refine oilsands bitumen, but rather upgrade it part 
way. That reduces the need to add diluent to the bitumen, which means 
more bitumen can fit down a <b>pipeline</b> and there is no need to remove diluent at the other end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP also want to see 
more liquification of natural gas done in Alberta so our methane and 
other gases can be shipped more easily to west coast terminals. That's 
all very sensible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the NDP hadn't 
sucked (taxed) so much money out of the patch already (not to mention 
discouraging so much investment and destroying so many jobs), maybe they
 wouldn't have to put back a billion dollars they don't have, just to 
try to stimulate some "diversification."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We should do some valueadded processing of our natural resources here, rather than always shipping our raw resources down a <b>pipeline</b> to be refined and turned into usable products somewhere else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was always 
shortsighted of former Tory governments not to get more refineries and 
upgraders built when the price of oil was high and environmental 
opposition was low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Give the NDP credit for 
taking a step in that direction. But maybe they won't have to spend tax 
dollars trying to force upgraders into existence if they hadn't 
undermined the energy sector so thoroughly in the first place.</p>

 officials dropped a bombshell on the community of Coniston earlier this
 month when, through a press release, Mayor Brian Bigger announced that 
Greater Sudbury had selected the small community as the preferred 
location for <span class="companylink">Noront Resources</span>'ferrochrome smelter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost immediately, 
officials were scrambling to provide information to stunned 
Conistonians. Coun. Deb McIntosh, whose ward includes Coniston, hastily 
arranged a public meeting for the following week. Mayor Bigger, fresh 
from his tour of the <span class="companylink">Outokumpu</span> 
ferrochrome facility in Finland, did the rounds with local media to 
assure the public that there is nothing to worry about when it comes to 
ferrochrome.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It all looked and sounded like damage control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost overnight, 
Conistonians, fearful of the impacts that a new smelter will have on 
their community, were provoked into action. A website was registered - 
www.saveconiston.ca[http://www.saveconiston.ca] - and content about the 
potentially harmful effects of chromite processing was being shared 
around the community via social media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the public meeting - 
the first where the city shared information directly with the impacted 
community - residents were demanding answers about chemical reactions 
and impacts related to trivalent and hexavalent chromium emissions. They
 also wanted to know how their community could have been selected by the
 city as the site for a massive new piece of industrial infrastructure 
without anyone from the city first asking residents for their opinions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents didn't trust 
the answers they received from municipal officials about industrial 
processes and the production of carcinogenic hexavalent chromium. And no
 answers at all were offered with regards to a lack of public 
consultation and community engagement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It didn't have to be this way, of course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this council has developed a nasty habit of making decisions first, and consulting with the public later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news for 
Conistonians opposed to the project may be that Noront hasn't yet made a
 decision regarding which northern municipality will play host to 
Ontario's first ferrochrome production facility. Greater Sudbury, 
Timmins, Sault Ste. Marie and Thunder Bay are all angling for Noront's 
prize: 350 full-time jobs and a $1 billion facility that will see 
chromite ore from the Ring of Fire turned into ferrochrome, an important
 product used to make stainless steel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Partnerships between 
governments and business interests that exclude citizen participation 
and engagement in decision-making processes are the old way of doing 
business. Today, citizens everywhere are finding their voices and are 
demanding active involvement in decision-making. And citizens are 
telling decision makers that they have the right to withhold their 
consent from development projects that threaten the health and 
well-being of their communities and the natural environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's called a <b>social license</b>
 - and while there is no legal requirement for decision-makers to obtain
 community consent, neglecting to do so can lead to delay and project 
abandonment as we have seen with natural gas and bitumen <b>pipeline</b> proposals elsewhere in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it stands now, with local opposition forming in reaction to citizens being kept in the dark by the city, there is no <b>social license</b>
 from the Coniston community to support Greater Sudbury's bid. 
Conistonians are telling Noront that a smelter is not wanted here, and 
pursuit of the facility will be opposed vigorously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Had the city made an 
effort to involve residents in the site selection process prior to 
submitting a bid, city officials could have worked together with 
residents and other stakeholders towards building a favourable consensus
 for the project - something that Noront would surely count in Greater 
Sudbury's favour. Instead, by keeping everyone in the dark, an 
opportunity to do business differently was lost - and ultimately the 
city's selection by Noront to host a new ferrochrome smelter might be 
lost along with it. Steve May is a member of the Green Party in Sudbury.</p>

Rachel Notley waxed lyrical about the benefits of imposing this "levy" 
on us rubes while shutting down our nasty coal industry, capping 
emissions from the oilsands and sending out environmental missionaries 
bearing gifts of free light bulbs and the wherewithal to screw them into
 our sockets. Ouch.</p>

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was giggly and gung-ho at telling the

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, those were the days. 
Yet, like a prairie summer, they didn't last. Soon, Notley got a 
reminder winter was a-coming, and not because she was watching Game of 
Thrones on <span class="companylink">Netflix</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First to put the boot into this brave new world of <b>social license</b>, where we'd scratch the environmental inch and in turn have our tummies tickled in getting oil to tidewater, was Quebec.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's left Trudeau 
twisting in the wind, so no wonder he's merrily messing about in India, 
even if no one there is that keen to greet him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, we've got the 
now-notorious wine ban. Glory be - whatever next? Maybe a B.C. salmon

 we're ditching the carbon tax. Next, we're reversing the mothballing of
 our coal industry that threatened the existence of so many Alberta 
towns and, finally, that cap on emissions - well, poof, it's gone. David
 Copperfield, eat your heart out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, but that's 
irresponsible. We'll be contributing to global warming and the seas will
 rise and threaten coastal areas everywhere. Oh, really? Darn it, but 
isn't Alberta well above 2,000 feet above sea level, even in the shallow
 bits? It'll be a while before we get our feet wet. Victoria and 
Vancouver, you say? Oh well, we'll have a whip round and send them some 
green-coloured sandbags.</p>

isn't moving in any other direction. So what if that messes up delicate <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>

 need those cars made in Ontario or those jets from Quebec.</p>

 October 2016, Prime Minister Trudeau's announcement that Canadian 
provinces would be required to adopt carbon pricing was met with wide 
political agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both the United States 
and China had recently agreed to the Paris climate accord, and 
provincial governments in Canada's three largest provinces had already 
committed to some form of carbon pricing.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta,
 home of Canada's most abundant oilsands and a traditional bastion of 
conservative support, had broken with decades of Progressive 
Conservative leadership, electing an NDP government that presented 
carbon pricing as a critical part of the oil industry's <b>social license</b>
 to export its products to market. Across the country, Liberal 
provincial governments held power. Conservatives were at a historically 
low ebb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former Prime Minister 
Harper's inability to adequately address climate change had hurt 
perceptions of Canadian resources; a new approach was needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What a difference 16 
months make. Alberta is locked in a battle with its provincial 
counterparts in British Columbia over the Trans Mountain <b>Pipeline</b>.
 While the federal government has expressed support for the project, the
 provincial governments are no longer in the same agreeable position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Albertans, who have long 
memories of the misguided National Energy Program devised by Pierre 
Elliott Trudeau's government, are increasingly conscious of the 
oilsands' vulnerabilities and are strongly resistant to any measures 
that may diminish its growth. Enter Jason Kenney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Breaking from years of 
the Alberta Progressive Conservative Party's efforts to court a bigger 
tent of voters, the former Harper cabinet minister has united the 
province's right-wing forces under a series of unapologetically 
conservative stances, including strident opposition to the carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As this takes place, action and rhetoric from the Trump administration has added pressure to Canadian oil producers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Prime Minister Trudeau and President Barack Obama struck similar tones about building <b>social license</b>
 for oil extraction, Trump has a drastically different vision for 
competitiveness, unlocking millions of jobs by slashing regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suddenly, carbon pricing is facing serious political headwinds as conservatives across Canada spring into action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some Conservatives 
briefly toyed with Michael Chong's plan for a revenue neutral carbon 
tax, Andrew Scheer won the leadership race by promising to scrap carbon 
pricing. He rejects the premise that taxes can fight climate change and 
has ardently emphasized their impact on affordability. The recent 
political climate has only contributed to his resolve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has allies. With 
Trump's election, the Liberal's newly created Canadian Energy Regulator 
and the harsh impact of the oilsands downturn on our national 
productivity, carbon pricing is beginning to feel like too much too soon
 for many Canadians. And in an era where political conversations are 
increasingly framed around affordability, the added burden of taxes has 
become problematic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This explains the recent 
shift in Ontario politics. Former Progressive Conservative Party of 
Ontario leader Patrick Brown shocked pundits and delegates alike when he
 announced his support for a revenue neutral carbon tax in March 2016. 
Many pundits saw this as a critical point in national discussions around
 carbon pricing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But his swift removal as 
leader has provided a window for anti-carbon pricing advocates to 
rebound in Ontario. While there may have been no appetite for such a 
position in 2016, leadership candidates are now willing to fight against
 carbon taxation in spades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All three leading 
leadership candidates for the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario 
have promised to oppose cap and trade, carbon taxation and any former of
 carbon pricing in no uncertain terms. Call it pandering. Call it 
impractical. But it represents a growing and formidable opposition from 
the most likely candidates to take over as premier of Canada's largest 
province this June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To add to that, 
Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe threatened that Trudeau's government 
would enforce the carbon tax on his province over “[his] dead body.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's clear is that 
after several years of standing down on the issue of the carbon tax, 
conservative parties and politicians are no longer willing to sit idly 
by and allow the Liberals to steer the agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's problematic for 
the federal government is that in many provinces, those same vocal 
opponents look to be set on a path to power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as the political 
tides have turned on this issue before, it seems they have once again — 
at least amongst the conservative base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result? Prime Minister Trudeau has a fight on his hands.</p>

Mr. Chris Bruijnzeels reports</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHAMARAN ANNOUNCES 25% INCREASE IN ATRUSH RESERVES ESTIMATES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Shamaran Petroleum Corp</span>. has increased 
by 25 per cent its estimated proven plus probable (2P) oil reserves for 
the Atrush block as of Dec. 31, 2017, after accounting for Atrush 2017 
production. Reserves and contingent resources estimates were provided by
 <span class="companylink">McDaniel &amp; Associates Consultants Ltd</span>.
 ("McDaniel"), the Company's independent qualified resources evaluator, 
and were prepared in accordance with standards set out in the Canadian 
National Instrument NI 51-101 and Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation 
Handbook (COGEH).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Chris Bruijnzeels, President and CEO of ShaMaran, commented: "These 
year-end reserve estimates demonstrate the world class nature of the 
Atrush field. Total Field Proven plus Probable ("2P") Reserves on a 
property gross basis for Atrush increased from 85.1 MMbbl to 102.7 MMbbl
 which, when 2017 Atrush production of 3.4 MMbbl is included, represents
 an increase of 25 percent. Total Field Unrisked Best Estimate 
Contingent Oil Resources ("2C") on a property gross basis for Atrush 
remained essentially the same at around 296 MMbbl, resulting in an 
overall increase in Atrush best estimate resources of 5%. Our 2018 work 
program aims to move more of the contingent resources into reserves."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McDaniel's estimates 
reflect the encouraging production results from the Atrush field 
following start of production in July 2017, as well as the positive 
drilling results of Chiya Khere-7 well which found the top of the 
reservoir 114 meters higher to prognosis. McDaniel's reserves estimates 
assume that four extra production wells will be drilled to further 
develop the medium gravity oil in the reserves area of the field, 
increasing medium oil recovery. Reserves associated with the heavy oil 
extended well test planned in 2018 for the Chiya Khere-6 well have also 
been included. Reserves which were included in McDaniel's previous 
estimate for heavy oil production from the wells currently producing 
have now been transferred to Contingent Resources because production to 
date has shown no indication of heavy oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(1)This estimate of 
remaining recoverable resources (unrisked) includes contingent resources
 that have not been adjusted for risk based on the chance of 
development. It is not an estimate of Volumes that may be recovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(2)Boe may be misleading,
 particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of 6 Mcf per 1
 Bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily 
applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency 
at the wellhead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company's crude oil 
reserves as of December 31, 2017 and the respective net present values 
of the reserves based on forecast prices and costs were estimated to be

(1)The Atrush Field contains crude oil of variable density. Fluid type is
   classified according to COGEH: Light/Medium Oil is based on density less
   than 920 kg/m3 and Heavy Oil is between 920 and 1000 kg/m3.
(2)Company gross reserves are based on the Company's 20.1 percent working
   interest share of the property gross reserves. 
(3)Company net reserves are based on Company share of total Cost and Profit
   Revenues. Note, as the government pays income taxes on behalf of the Company
   out of the government's profit oil share, the net reserves were based on the
   effective pre-tax profit revenues by adjusting for the tax rate.

Notes: 
(1)Based on a 20.1 percent Company working interest share of the property gross resources.
(2)There is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the resources.
(3)The Atrush Field contains crude oil of variable density. Fluid type is classified according to
   COGEH: Light/Medium Oil is based on density less than 920 kg/m3 and Heavy Oil is between 920 and
   1000 kg/m3.
(4)These are unrisked contingent resources that do not account for the chance of development which
   is defined as the probability of a project being commercially viable. Quantifying the chance of
   development requires consideration of both economic contingencies and other contingencies, such
   as legal, regulatory, market access, political, <b>social license</b>, internal and external approvals
   and commitment to project finance and development timing. As many of these factors are extremely
   difficult to quantify, the chance of development is uncertain and must be used with caution. The
   chance of development was estimated to be 80 percent for the Crude Oil and 5 percent for the
   Natural Gas.
(5)The contingent resources are sub-classified as "development unclarified" with an "undetermined"
   economic status.

 ("ShaMaran" or the "Company") (TSX VENTURE:SNM) (OMX:SNM) is pleased to
 report an increase by 25% in estimated Proven plus Probable ("2P") Oil 
Reserves for the Atrush block as of December 31, 2017 after accounting 
for Atrush 2017 production. Reserves and contingent resources estimates 
were provided by <span class="companylink">McDaniel &amp; Associates Consultants Ltd</span>.

Chris Bruijnzeels, President and CEO of ShaMaran, commented: "These 
year-end reserve estimates demonstrate the world class nature of the 
Atrush field.&nbsp;Total Field Proven plus Probable ("2P") Reserves on a
 property gross basis for Atrush increased from 85.1 MMbbl to 102.7 
MMbbl which, when 2017 Atrush production of 3.4 MMbbl is included, 
represents an increase of 25 percent. Total Field Unrisked Best Estimate
 Contingent Oil Resources ("2C") on a property gross basis for Atrush 
remained essentially the same at around 296 MMbbl, resulting in an 
overall increase in Atrush best estimate resources of 5%. Our 2018 work 
program aims to move more of the contingent resources into reserves."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McDaniel's estimates 
reflect the encouraging production results from the Atrush field 
following start of production in July 2017, as well as the positive 
drilling results of Chiya Khere-7 well which found the top of the 
reservoir 114 meters higher to prognosis. McDaniel's reserves estimates 
assume that four extra production wells will be drilled to further 
develop the medium gravity oil in the reserves area of the field, 
increasing medium oil recovery. Reserves associated with the heavy oil 
extended well test planned in 2018 for the Chiya Khere-6 well have also 
been included. Reserves which were included in McDaniel's previous 
estimate for heavy oil production from the wells currently producing 
have now been transferred to Contingent Resources because production to 
date has shown no indication of heavy oil.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since boycotts are suddenly fashionable, perhaps now would be an ideal time to suggest we collectively abandon the phrase <b>social license</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when it's become of crucial importance to overcome opposition to Alberta's energy exports and the needed <b>pipeline</b> infrastructure, the phrase <b>social license</b> is confusing, cringe worthy, politically loaded and needlessly distracting. Both sides need to retire it.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In
 this instance, both sides, refers to the current Alberta government and
 its approach to energy projects and environmental regulations, and the 
opposition, who have been, and remain, skeptical of the government's 
approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most everyone agrees that the amount of opposition to a proposed <b>pipeline</b>
 is directly correlated to the difficulty in seeing that project through
 to completion. Therefore, it would logically follow that we need to do 
as much as we can to overcome that opposition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One could call that <b>social license</b>, perhaps, but the phrase has already lost most of whatever meaning it had.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concept of <b>social license</b>
 was not invented in Alberta, but it would appear as though the 
government of former premier Alison Redford was the first to use it. A 
June 2012 statement of cabinet and caucus priorities, for example, notes
 the importance of "maintain(ing) the <b>social license</b> to develop resources."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Rachel Notley's government has used it, too, albeit sparingly. The 
premier's preface to the 2016 budget speaks of the need to "strengthen 
Alberta's <b>social license</b>."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Otherwise, though, you'd 
be hard-pressed to find many example of the premier or other members of 
her government using the phrase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To some, the concept 
invokes almost a literal license of sorts - as though Notley is capable 
of establishing such rock solid progressive bona fides that she can wave
 her "<b>social license</b>" around like a sheriff's badge and immediately command the respect of <b>pipeline</b> opponents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Notley can 
certainly be faulted for pandering to environmental groups - and giving 
activists such as Tzeporah Berman positions of power and influence - she
 has never claimed to be capable of vanquishing all opposition to the 
oilsands or pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She deliberately sought 
to try and reassure environmentalists that her government wouldn't 
ignore their concerns, but it's unclear how much she has to show for 
that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hence, the new argument that Notley's <b>social license</b> has clearly failed. This is evidenced, it's argued, by the fact that opponents of the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b> have not backed down and now B.C. Premier John Horgan is angling to make trouble for the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What exactly has failed, 
though? Notley's government sold their climate leadership plan (i.e., 
their carbon tax) on the notion that it would make it easier for Prime 
Minister Justin Trudeau to approve <b>pipeline</b> projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that Trudeau did 
indeed say yes to Trans Mountain - and even credited Notley's approach -
 it's hard to argue that approach has failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may yet. Notley is 
going to have to sell the carbon tax in the next election, and if she 
doesn't have an answer to the question, "what do we have to show for 
it?," then she could be in big trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the premier has 
explicitly linked her carbon tax to new pipelines, the demise of Trans 
Mountain would indeed be a failure for her. We'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's also the argument that <b>social license</b>
 is a myth, which of course, depends on how you define it in the first 
place. That it quickly becomes impossible to confirm or discredit such a
 vague assertion is yet another reason to retire the phrase altogether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not a myth to 
assert that Alberta needs to make the case for its energy industry and 
the needed capacity to get our product to market. It is not a myth to 
argue that we need to win over as many allies to our cause as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People can disagree on 
how best to accomplish that or how to define success. Either way, we'll 
be better off if we never hear the phrase <b>social license</b> ever again.</p>

 Our Wednesday trio of MPs spanning the party divide are here for their 
always respectful analysis of each other's flawed logic. Candice Bergen 
is the official opposition house leader, Tracey Ramsey NDP MP from 
lovely Essex, and Steve MacKinnon is a government parliamentary 
secretary of procurement. All right, welcome to you all.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: That too. If you want to buy something from the government, you got to go to Steve, basically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: Well, no, no, no. Not quite. Not quite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Let's talk about this <b>pipeline</b>
 feud. We spent a lot of time on it on the show already, but I find this
 a really intriguing story. I don't know which side the NDP is on. BC, 
Alberta, what's your position, Tracey? Help me understand it, because I 
couldn't figure it out from your leader today?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TRACEY RAMSEY (NDP – 
Ontario): Well Rachel Notley is doing the job that she's been elected to
 do, and she is the premier with the most advanced I would say climate 
change plan that we have in our country right now. And John Horgan is 
also doing the job that he's been elected to do. What we see in the NDP 
federally is that Justin Trudeau is not doing what he promised. He's 
broken a promise to Canadians about the process. He promised to have a 
new environmental assessment process. He promised to talk about <b>social license</b>.
 And what do we see in Nanaimo last week at the town hall with him is 
that people in BC do not feel that he has done that, and we federally 
know that he has not done that. This is a broken promise about something
 that he made a commitment to standing in BC repeatedly throughout the 
election campaign. So this really is on the prime minister because he's 
now approved a project in this broken process, and he's using a little 
bit of some addressing some of the very serious issues that exist around
 the ocean protection as blackmail now about this <b>pipeline</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: I'm trying to figure out where you are. Should the <b>pipeline</b> proceed, or should the <b>pipeline</b> be stopped? If you had to choose "A" or "B", which would it be?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RAMSEY: For myself, I'm 
not going to choose "A" or "B" because this is about the provinces 
coming to what is best for them, and it's also about the federal 
government stepping in and playing a role here. Let's start the 
assessment process over. If Justin Trudeau is so convinced that this 
assessment process is the right way to go, then restart the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: They're going to do that tomorrow though aren't they? You're not starting the process over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: We committed 
to indeed redo the environmental assessment process. It is flawed, and 
we will be announcing in the fullness of time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Tomorrow anyway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: Amendments to that process. Let's recap though. On <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>, we had an enhanced process where we put a panel on top of prior <span class="companylink">NEB</span> review of the panel. We had Aboriginal involvement. We had involvement of former prominent British Columbians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: But now we're at a stalemate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: Well, no, 
we're not at a stalemate. In fact we are at the culmination. This 
project has been approved. We wish to see it through. It is in the 
national interest. All of those things have been determined, have been 
determined by a constitutionally valid process, and we're doing three 
things, Don. We know that we have to get alternative and diverse markets
 for our energy resources. We know that a lot of our prosperity depends 
on that. We also know that you don't have to decide between the 
environment and the economy, because we've put in place a national 
climate framework with a carbon tax. We've put in a national oceans 
protection plan, $1.5 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: One law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: Well, no, these are important points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Well what's Trudeau's next step is what I'm asking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: These are important points to make. MARTIN: Jump in here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CANDICE BERGEN 
(Conservative House Leader): Where is the prime minister? We are on the 
verge of what could be a crisis between two governments, two provincial 
governments. We also have a <b>pipeline</b> that has been approved that 
is in the best interests of Canadians. It's certainly in the best 
interests of jobs for Canadians. We need the prime minister. Where is 
he? He's travelling around the US right now. He's in California talking 
about diversity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Chicago today, California tomorrow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BERGEN: He should be in 
Canada. Sorry, excuse me. Oh, I just saw his itinerary. It was a speech 
on diversity tomorrow. He should be in Canada. He should be talking to 
the premier of British Columbia. He should be taking and asserting 
leadership on this. This is in the national interest. You know, we saw 
the last time the prime minister was too afraid to talk to a municipal 
leader, it was Denis Coderre who didn't like Energy East, and the prime 
minister refused to stand up for pipelines in general, certainly he 
didn't say anything about Energy East, and the Liberal policies killed 
Energy East. Here's the problem and the real risk. If this <b>pipeline</b>
 is delayed, if Trans Mountain is delayed for too long, at some point 
the proponents go, you know what, we're outta here. That is a very real 
possibility. We need leadership. We need the prime minister to get home 
and to do his job for Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: This project has been permitted. It is in the national interest, and it will proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Okay. I don't want to go on. Mercedes Stephenson, our <span class="companylink">CTV</span>
 superstar here, had a very interesting story last night that actually 
got some new traction in question period today. Basically there's a 
class-action suit that's going forward by potentially thousands of 
soldiers, male and female, mostly female, who are saying that they were 
sexually harassed, or discriminated against, or maybe even assaulted in 
some cases. This case, the legal department, the government's legal 
department is arguing that it doesn't have an obligation to provide a 
harassment-free work force for the individual. Steve, help me understand
 why you would argue that position, because it sounds like you ran away 
from it today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: Two important 
points. First of all, let's remember operation honour, the chief of the 
defence staff, the minister. Certainly this culture, if I can call it 
that, has seemed to grow over time, and it is a major challenge for the 
Canadian Armed Forces. I think that's been acknowledged, and I think 
that that's the product of many years, and we're tackling that head-on. 
Dozens of people have been released from the forces, and there have been
 major consequences, so that work continues apace, and I think the 
minister and others deserve praise for that, and I'm sure my colleagues 
would agree. With respect to the court case, it was fairly clear that in
 a pleading, some of the government's lawyers put in a phrase that did 
not accurately capture how the government feels about its custodial 
requirements over members of the armed forces, and the prime minister 
made that very clear and is instructing the attorney general.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Speaking of that, let's hear what the prime minister had to say. This is what Justin Trudeau said earlier today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
JUSTIN TRUDEAU (Canadian Prime Minister): News this morning that there 
were concerns about what the Justice Department is arguing in a sexual 
harassment case around the military is something that is of concern to 
me, and I've asked the attorney general to follow up with the lawyers to
 make sure that we argue things that are consistent with this 
government's philosophy. Obviously what the lawyers have been arguing 
does not align with what my belief, or what this government believes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: I guess some people would say he's speaking one way in the court of public opinion and another way in a court of law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BERGEN: This is another 
example, and there's just becoming such a long list of examples where 
the prime minister's actions don't line up with his words. The fact is 
the prime minister put together a committee of his own cabinet 
ministers, seven cabinet ministers, including the justice minister, to 
actually look at litigation and to put it through the political and the 
belief lens. His cabinet ministers, his minister of justice would have 
signed off on this. What this boils down to, and we see this in this 
government, where their words don't line up, and so the prime minister 
talks about creating a safe workplace, he talks about addressing sexual 
harassment, but when it's really, when it's tough, when he has to 
actually step up, and his government has to step up and do it, we see 
this argument, and his own cabinet would have signed off on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Tracey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RAMSEY: This is a blow to
 the work that's been done over the past month and over the past week in
 a nonpartisan way inside the house. We've been having conversations 
about guaranteeing a harassment-free workplace, and then we have 
something like this come out where lawyers are essentially saying that 
our military does not deserve that. It's not something that they are 
entitled to. This is bizarre to have the lawyers come out, and I think 
that knowing that ministers have seen this, that they're aware of this, 
and then this to come forward, it does such a disservice to the great 
work that we're trying to do inside this house for all Canadians. It's 
unacceptable that people in our military are being told that they do not
 deserve a harassment-free workplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: There's also been
 another bit of a backtrack today. The government did approve the sale 
of a bunch of Bell helicopters built just in Quebec to the Philippines. 
This is a country where human rights records and how they treat drug 
trafficking and that sort of thing has been a big conflict. So it was 
exposed, and now it sounds, Steve, if I'm not mistaking it, the 
government is going to reconsider this. Is that what we're talking 
about?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: Well, no. In fact we have not approved a sale of helicopters to the Philippines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: That's news to the Philippines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: If such a sale
 occurred, it did not occur on our watch, and although we do 
diplomatically engage with Philippines, I know the minister when she was
 there raised human rights, or possible human rights violations that may
 have occurred in the Philippines, and obviously we want to ensure that 
Canadian equipment is not used in such ways, so the <span class="companylink">government of Canada</span> will continue to watch this. But to be very clear, the <span class="companylink">government of Canada</span> did not, the current <span class="companylink">government of Canada</span> did not approve the sale of these helicopters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Tracey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RAMSEY: So here's this 
thing. This isn't about a permit, an export permit, because these were 
actually done through the defence department. So this is a government 
department that this has happened through, and it was a direct sale 
versus having an export permit. So I don't, I think that what's been 
identified to everyone is that we have a process that is full of holes. 
We have loopholes that we've created where we can have certain 
departments, an export permit here, different processes being applied. 
We have to stop exporting to countries with massive human rights 
violations. It's unacceptable to Canadians. Canadians do not want this 
to be on our reputation on the global stage, and the Liberals cannot 
hide behind saying that their government didn't do this. They have to 
overhaul the process. It's something that the NDP has been calling for, 
and we have to ensure that we know where our helicopters are going, when
 we have Duterte who's saying basically at one point he threw someone 
out of a helicopter. Like this is so egregious. It's very concerning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: It's a tough one, you know, because there's big economic impacts for these contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BERGEN: Well here's the 
challenge. And I mean under a previous governments there is a process 
whereby these types of sales are looked at and either approved or 
denied. The problem is it creates a lot of jobs in Canada, and a lot of 
this equipment is going to be purchased from the UK, from Germany, from 
Australia, from other countries, and so, you know, for sure, if there 
are ways that we can tighten up and ensure that our equipment is not 
being misused, definitely, but I think it would be irresponsible to say 
that to our, it would be irresponsible to our aerospace industry, to a 
lot of industries in Canada that create a lot of jobs that we just won't
 sell anything anymore to a country that may not be in line with our 
human rights record, even though very big concerns definitely with what 
would be done with those helicopters, but it has to be looked at 
carefully and you can't throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: To be clear, Canada would never approve a sale where human rights violations were... MARTIN: Saudi Arabia?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: ...were preemptively anticipated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: You are late for a vote, you three, so I'm going to let you go, even though... BERGEN: Are we too boring for you, Don?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: You're great. You got to vote. You're the house leader so you should probably be in the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BERGEN: Well that's right, I better get there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: All right, thank you all. We'll see you next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: Thanks, Don.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BERGEN: Thanks.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DON MARTIN: All right. 
Let's reality check all this with the president of the Canadian Chamber 
of Commerce, Perrin Beatty joins me in the studio. Mr. Beatty, nice to 
have you as always. You've heard both sides now. Sounds like they're 
digging in. What do you make of it?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
PERRIN BEATTY (Canadian Chamber of Commerce): It's time for the prime 
minister to get people together, say come, let us reason together. Let's
 have an understanding here about where we're going, that we're one 
country, not 13, that the rule of law is going to apply in Canada, and 
that we won't take each other's business communities hostage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Yeah, but you tweeted earlier today that this is a fight between BC and the rest of Canada. Why did you say that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEATTY: Because it's 
being positioned today as if it's a fight between the people of British 
Columbia and the people of Alberta. It's not. It's between the 
government of British Columbia and Canada. It comes down to who we are 
as a country, the fact that we're one nation. It's the federal 
government that has the responsibility to define the national interests.
 So here's a project that's gone through all the regulatory procedures. 
The rule of law has been followed. There's been lengthy discussion of 
it. The decision has been made. All sorts of conditions have been set 
that have to be met by the project. It's moving ahead. And the 
government has declared it in the national interest. At some point you 
have to be able to decide and move ahead or else you simply have a 
stalemate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: All right, so rule of law must always trump <b>social license</b>. Is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEATTY: I think the rule of law is absolutely critical, and <b>social license</b>
 is a part of it. Without the rule of law, how do you achieve social 
licence? If it's simply going to be something made up as you go along, 
and somebody will be able to say, any premier, or any other elected 
official, I disagree so I'm going to throw out all of the process that's
 gone before, that doesn't work. Imagine if British Columbia were coming
 into confederation today. Part of the confederation deal was the 
building of the CPR. Imagine if Alberta was standing in the way and 
saying we won't allow the CPR to be built across the territory of 
Alberta to tie British Columbia to the rest of Canada. We wouldn't have 
stood for that for a second. Nor should we stand for any provincial 
government saying, after all of these discussions, we're going to stand 
in the way and prevent one of the provinces from getting its resources 
to market in a responsible way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Now you've got a history with some politics in there. You at one point in time were a cabinet minister.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEATTY: A long, long, you're showing your age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: But sometimes 
politics blasts on. And I'm wondering, if both of these leaders, both of
 these premiers have electoral survival at stake here. Horgan can't be 
seen as caving on the <b>pipeline</b>, and Rachel Notley can't exist for a second term without a <b>pipeline</b>.
 How do you bridge that gap? Is it talk, or do you let Trudeau run in 
there with the constitutional powers he has and just force the building 
of this thing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEATTY: I think that's 
where the federal government comes in. What you have is you have a 
political problem here with two premiers who are locked in, who are 
looking to their local interests, their provincial interests. In the 
case of the government of British Columbia, they are looking for 
survival there, because they have to secure their majority within the 
legislature. There has to be somebody outside of this to say, look, the 
national interest comes first. That's where the federal government comes
 in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: We've seen 
premiers conferences talk about knocking down barriers across provinces 
since I was a cub reporter, and I just sort of wonder, it seems to me 
the walls are getting higher than ever. Is the day ever going to happen 
where we actually have free trade amongst provinces, never mind with the
 <span class="companylink">United States government</span>?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEATTY: That was vision 
of the fathers of confederation. It will be terrible if the current 
generation of premiers were the fathers and mothers of deconfederation 
where we're building walls and petitioning Canada. The bizarre thing is 
we're actually making progress as it relates to <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>.
 We may very well find that we can take down some of the barriers that 
have been threatened between Canada and the US. Wouldn't it be just 
beyond ironic if at the same time as we were taking down international 
barriers, we were erecting them internally within Canada. It makes no 
sense whatsoever. And what definitely doesn't make sense is to take 
somebody else's business community hostage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Good point. Trudeau is down there in the States trying to save <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>, but he might have to save interprovincial trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEATTY: It's a, this is a case where charity begins at home, I think.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: All right, Perrin, thanks for coming in. Appreciate that.</p>

 SOLOMON: Well, when the cranes pulled down the statue of the military 
officer Edward Cornwallis, the so-called modern founder of Halifax back 
in 1749, the controversy continued. Cornwallis, after all, was the 
author of the so-called scalping proclamation, which offered a bounty to
 anyone who killed a Mi'kmaq First Nation. But on the week when the 
words of the national anthem are actually changed to be more gender 
neutral, we've gone from "all of thy sons command" to "all of us 
command." Some are saying history is being erased. Others are saying, 
it's about time. To talk about this and the big <b>pipeline</b> debate 
going on, the scrum is back. Of course Laura, Joyce and Craig are here. 
As always, and our special guest is professor Pam Palmater, chair in 
indigenous governance at <span class="companylink">Ryerson University</span>,
 and a Mi'kmaq activist. She joins us from Toronto. Great to have 
everyone here and Pam, let me start with you and then start with this 
thing, taking down the statue of Cornwallis, right thing to do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PAM PALMATER (Indigenous 
Activist): Oh, of course it's the right thing to do, and it's long 
overdue. I mean, we're talking about someone who symbolized genocide, 
the outright, you know, paid bounty to murder people. And that's not 
something that should be normalized or celebrated or memorialized. Now 
that taking down his statue doesn't remove what he did or didn't do for 
Halifax and the history books. That will all still be there. But it's a 
necessary part of de-colonizing, reconciliation and really stopping this
 normalization of violence against indigenous people, which was very 
specific and targeted the Mi'kmaq people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Laura, look, I 
have no problem with that because the scalping proclamation is so 
clearly something vile. On the other hand, there are those that say 
there's what's called presentism, judging people in the 1740s by 
standards in 2018, and that's just not fair. What do, how, what's the 
balance there?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAURA STONE (The Globe 
and Mail): Yeah, no, to me, this is all about context. You know, I agree
 with Pam that you can't be erasing Cornwallis' legend at all, like his 
history. We need to put what he did in context of what's acceptable now.
 It's a teachable moment. So maybe you take down a statue that many 
people think revered him, but you put that in a museum, which I 
understand they may be doing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: The Mi'kmaq want him in a...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STONE: ...want him in a museum with an explanation of what happened, which gives the full story of who he was.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CRAIG OLIVER (CTV News): 
In the 17th and 18th century even, it was not a standard to put a price 
on people's heads who had done nothing...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PALMATER: Exactly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: ...and murder

gentleman, did not go around putting a price on people to kill, to have 
them killed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JOYCE NAPIER (CTV News): 
Why not put a plaque? Why not remind people what this man did, instead 
of trying to erase the past, we can't. It's full of contradictions. It's

right?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Instead of taking it down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAPIER: We have Holocaust

people that this should never happen again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PALMATER: You can't have 
both ways. You can't have your cake and eat it, too. You don't get to 
memorialize and celebrate and commemorate someone who committed 
genocide, and then just put a little plaque and say, but you know, they 
shouldn't do it again. Look at Germany, they totally de-Nazified 
Germany, and it was against the will of the people, and it took many 
decades for the people of Germany to understand why they had to remove 
statues and flags and everything else. Because it's about changing minds
 and hearts. And you will never do that so long as they are 
memorialized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Okay, we just, I want to move to this other issue, which is <b>pipeline</b>
 debates. And Laura, let me just start with you because we had Rachel 
Notley on. Look, Rachel Notley's election depends on, she's got to build
 a <b>pipeline</b>. She's the (inaudible). But on the other hand, Premier Horgan in BC, his election depends on not building a <b>pipeline</b>. And Justin Trudeau's stuck in the middle. What does Trudeau do here with this <b>pipeline</b>?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STONE: Well, I think he has to put his money where his mouth is. He says that this <b>pipeline</b>
 is going to get built. He's been saying this in town halls across the 
country. So now, he's going to be painted into a corner by the 
Conservatives to promise, absolutely, to show how his government is 
going to do this. He can't just have all these talking points now where 
he says, it's going to get built without any action. So, he's going to 
be under a lot of pressure to interfere in this fight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: Because this is 
not just a challenge from BC to Alberta. It's also a challenge on 
federal power. And he represents that power, or else he weakens the 
credibility of his own government. Every legal case, judges have said 
the federal government has total, complete jurisdiction over the 
building of these pipelines. Don't get in the way. So, Trudeau has to 
push that and he may even have to go nuclear. He may have to use the 
declaration clause in section 92 of the Constitution, which takes away 
jurisdiction from provincial cities and the province, and gives it to 
his own government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: He could. I don't know if he will. Joyce, where do you think he is on this?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAPIER: I'm with Laura, 
you know? As soon as Horgan came to power, I remember, we were at the 
G7. We asked him that question. Will you move on? Will you push ahead 
with the <b>pipeline</b>? And he said, yes. It was unequivocal. So, he said yes. Put your money where your mouth is, and now act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: One of the 
things he's also signed off on is what's called the United Nations 
Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous People, which means indigenous 
peoples have not, they don't just need their consultation, consent. And 
if there's indigenous people...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PALMATER: Exactly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: ...in BC that don't want this, how does Justin Trudeau, who supposedly champions that, then champion that <b>pipeline</b>? What do you think he does?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PALMATER: Well, I don't think he can. I mean in these town halls, he has been championing this <b>pipeline</b>,
 as you know, environmentally friendly and needed for the country. But 
he also forgets how he got elected, and it was on the promise that he 
couldn't do any of these things without a community license, a <b>social license</b>
 where the people say yes, and he also said, fully recognizes the United
 Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, promises free 
prior and informed consent. And there is not consent. And he's also 
disregarding the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>
 in (inaudible) most recent Chilcotin case, which says Aboriginal title 
is exclusive, that's exclusive use management benefit, and there are 
many First Nations along that area that are going to make claims to 
Aboriginal title that say you simply can't do it without our consent. So
 he may be distracted by the provincial battle right now, but he's 
really forgetting how much power First Nations have.</p>

great to have you on the program. Real pleasure. And of course, Joyce 
Napier, always great to see Joyce. And Laura Stone and our great friend

Justin Trudeau has the jurisdiction to push back B.C.'s new threat to block the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b>, but does he have the will?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Prime Minister hoped 
he had done the politics on pipelines in 2016, long before an election, 
balancing approval of an expansion of the <b>pipeline</b> to Burnaby, 
B.C., with a price on carbon and a climatechange agreement with 
provinces. But the mess is back, and that spells trouble for Mr. 
Trudeau.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">British
 Columbia's NDP government, which depends on Green Party support to 
survive, announced a review of whether a bitumen spill could be properly
 cleaned up – and said it would regulate to block any increase the flow 
of bitumen through the province and onto tankers until that review is 
completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If this were just a 
jurisdictional fight between B.C. and Ottawa, it would be pretty easy 
for Mr. Trudeau to push back. B.C. has powers to regulate its 
environment, but approving pipelines, and the inter-provincial 
transportation of resources such as oil, is federal jurisdiction. The <b>pipeline</b>
 is supposed to meet provincial rules, but if B.C. is using them to 
frustrate the federal government's powers, it would have a hard time 
making its case in court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this is politics. Mr.
 Trudeau has to worry that if he picks a fight with B.C., it shines the 
spotlight on his approval of the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b>. That 
just brings up a decision that is unpopular with environmentally 
conscious Liberal voters, and with some of the constituents of 
Liberalheld ridings in the Lower Mainland. The Liberals wanted the 
controversy to cool down, not fire up as the 2019 election gets closer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Alberta Premier 
Rachel Notley called an emergency cabinet meeting on Wednesday and 
threatened legal action if B.C. tries to prevent the flow of more 
bitumen, federal Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr was mum, standing 
pat on a terse statement he issued on Tuesday. That statement said the 
Liberal government stands by its approval of the <b>pipeline</b> – but did not warn B.C. it does not have the power to obstruct the decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Notley's government 
wants Ottawa to make a stronger statement. “Alberta also expects the 
federal government to stand up and defend the constitution and its 
significance to the economic stability of the country," Cheryl Oates, 
Ms. Notley's director of communications, said in an e-mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were already significant court challenges filed by First Nations and 157 conditions that <b>pipeline</b> promoter <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd</span>.
 had to meet. The B.C. government has every right to review whether it 
is really feasible to clean up a spill of diluted bitumen. But their 
right to apply environmental protections is likely to stop at Ottawa's 
power to approve pipelines. Among the plans, according to B.C.'s 
backgrounder, is to broaden its authority over marine affairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ottawa has the sole 
power to regulate the navigation and shipping of the oil tankers that 
would carry the diluted bitumen, said Dalhousie University law professor
 Aldo Chircop, a professor of maritime law at Dalhousie University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the moment, B.C. has 
not said just how it proposes to regulate to prevent an increase in the 
amount of bitumen that flows through the province, but almost any 
effective measure is likely to meet a pretty stiff challenge from those 
who insist it is Ottawa's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having jurisdiction does 
not help Mr. Trudeau with his political problem, though. He thought he 
had finessed the issue in 2016 by promising to balance approval of the <b>pipeline</b> with climate action. Mr. Trudeau and Ms. Notley argued that climate policy was supposed to help provide the “<b>social license</b>"
 for oil sands development and pipelines. Mr. Trudeau also got the 
government of former BC Liberal premier Christy Clark to buy in by 
pumping $1.5-billion into an ocean protection plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That neat piece of work 
is unravelling now. B.C. Premier John Horgan is already facing tension 
with his Green Party partner Andrew Weaver over approval of the Site C 
dam and apparent interest in liquefied natural gas projects. He has to 
talk tough on Trans Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trudeau, meanwhile, 
cannot just ditch his promise to make sure Canadian resources get to 
market – that was the balance between development and environment he 
promised. But it is politically dangerous to act too tough with a B.C. 
government that argues it is protecting its citizens against 
environmental risks, especially as an election gets nearer.</p>

Jason Kenney, UCP leader of the official opposition, speaking to 
supporters after being sworn in as member of Calgary-Lougheed in the 
Chamber at the Alberta Legislature in Edmonton, January 29, 2018. Ed 
Kaiser/Postmedia</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UCP Leader Jason Kenney pounced at a news conference Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He called the B.C. action
 "another attack on Alberta's energy industry by New Democrats - by 
Rachel Notley's friends and fellow travelers, a party in B.C. for which 
she used to work."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's extremely 
embarrassing for our premier that she has been unable to persuade her 
fellow New Democrats to stop this attack on our province's economy and 
on free trade within Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's also unfortunate 
that the Prime Minister (Justin Trudeau) has been unable to stop this 
attack on the economic union within Canada."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One knock on Notley is 
that she puts too much faith in the goodwill of others. She imposed a 
carbon tax and stringent carbon standards, partly for serious 
environmental reasons, but also to win "<b>social license</b>" for pipelines from other Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If she is doubly betrayed
 - if Ottawa doesn't resolve this, and B.C. keeps throwing spike belts 
on the highway - her chances of re-election are virtually zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday Kenney rather 
tamely demanded a court challenge to the new B.C. rules, but in the past
 he's threatened retaliatory trade action if B.C. continues to be 
obstructive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Trade is a two-way 
street, and if I were premier and the government of British Columbia 
were blocking one of our prime exports, we would find ways to respond in
 kind that would be an economic response," he said last Aug. 4.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a great deal 
that British Columbia depends on that comes from Alberta. We'll find 
whatever points of leverage are necessary to demonstrate that a province
 cannot do that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley doesn't threaten 
any specific action. She perhaps hopes that Horgan is just playing to 
his base until Ottawa inevitably lowers the hammer and the <b>pipeline</b> goes ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at this point, it's foolish just to express outrage and hope it all works out.</p>

 a perverse kind of way, this week's 50-per-cent increase in Alberta's 
unpopular carbon tax - to $30 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions - 
could be a big gift from Rachel Notley's NDP government to her opponent,
 United Conservative Party (UCP) opposition leader Jason Kenney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase means the province now ties British Columbia for having the highest carbon tax in the country.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in Alberta it stings as the province uses more energy for heating and transportation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost in a typical 
Alberta household of a $30 a tonne tax is $667 a year, compared to $362 
in the typical B.C. household, according to a study by Jennifer Winter, 
an energy economist at the University of Calgary's school of public 
policy. At $50 a tonne, the annual cost is $1,111 in Alberta and $603 in
 B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's no small change in a
 lousy provincial economy with high unemployment. Polls consistently 
show strong disapproval of the tax, which piles on top of higher taxes 
and increased environmental regulations that are depressing job creation
 in the oil and gas sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's hefty carbon 
tax is one of the big pieces of the province's climate leadership plan, 
pushed through by Notley's government when Alberta's conservatives were 
in disarray and political implications seemed remote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question is whether 
Albertans embrace the tough medicine and its benefits, as claimed by the
 government, or will slam the door on the tax grab when they return to 
the polls next year. That's what the UCP, which reunited conservatives 
last year and picked Kenney to lead them, is counting on. Meanwhile, the
 duelling views are clashing hard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">University of Calgary 
economics professor Trevor Tombe said the carbon tax is controversial 
because it's visible in heating bills and at the pumps and because of 
its negative economic impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even government estimates show it shrinks GDP and deters employment, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the plan, the tax 
increases to $50 a tonne by 2022 to line up with federal goals. But 
other provinces are taking longer to ramp up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carbon is priced at $19 a tonne in the cap and trade market in Quebec and Ontario.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Provinces without carbon 
pricing are subject to the federal carbon price, which starts at $10 per
 tonne in 2018 and rises by $10 per year to $50 per tonne in 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta NDP says the 
benefits of its carbon tax include economic diversification away from 
oil and gas, job creation from greener jobs, emissions reductions, tax 
rebates for those with lower incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, green job 
creation hasn't offset the estimated 100,000 oil and gas jobs lost over 
the last three years, partly due to Alberta's climate change plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cheryl Oates, 
communications director for Notley, said 2,000 jobs have been created 
from energy efficiency programs so far and another 1,300 jobs are 
expected. The recently announced winning bidders of renewable 
electricity projects are expected to create another 740 jobs, with 7,000
 jobs overall expected in new renewable energy by 2030.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province estimates it
 will collect $1.038 billion in revenue from the tax in fiscal 2017-18, 
rising to $1.396 billion in 2018-2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All revenue from carbon 
pricing is reinvested back into Alberta's economy to reduce emissions, 
support renewable energy and help Alberta families and businesses adjust
 to the price of carbon," said Oates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government also 
argues that even with the increase in carbon pricing, Alberta has an 
overall tax advantage compared to other provinces because it has no 
provincial sales tax, health premium or payroll tax. It estimates 
Albertans and Alberta businesses will still pay at least $8.7 billion 
less in total taxes and carbon charges than if the province had the same
 tax system and carbon pricing as other provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney says he would

 same time put a big dent in the federal government's own climate change
 plan, which relies on Alberta toeing the line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Alberta families and 
jobcreators have suffered enough under this NDP government, and now they
 have to endure a 50 per cent increase in a carbon tax that hasn't 
converted a single opponent of Alberta's energy industry into a

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The carbon tax was supposed to buy '<b>social license</b>'for

everything it can to block TransMountain. Not one single government,

as a result of the NDP's failed tax on everything."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the trend continues, and the two remaining <b>pipeline</b> projects aren't built, Notley would hand her political opponents another big gift by showing the tax is all pain and no gain.</p>

 issues from lack of egress options to regulatory hurdles continue to 
dampen the competitiveness of Canada’s oil and gas sector and have 
contributed to increasing doubt among investors as to Canada’s 
attractiveness, say industry experts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Brian Schmidt, president and CEO of Tamarack Valley Energy Ltd. and a current board member of the <span class="companylink">Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP)</span>,
 said that in recent years the Canadian oilpatch has been delivered a 
series of “body blows” that have hindered the ability of companies to 
raise cash. Coupled with the impacts of the prolonged downturn, and it’s
 been tough sledding.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And
 Schmidt, who is chairman of CAPP’s Alberta Executive Policy Group, says
 current governments are doing little to help the situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think in other 
downturns we had help from governments that were interested in 
supporting our business. But we don’t have that right now. We’re pretty 
much on our own,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In fact, we’ve been dealt some significant body blows with <b>pipeline</b>
 issues, increased regulations, carbon tax, minimum wage—there are a lot
 of things that are working against the industry right now. And I think 
the [cancelation of] the Energy East <b>pipeline</b> was a very significant event that I don’t think we understand the total impact of. It was quite negative,” Schmidt added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So if you’re an investor
 and looking at several jurisdictions, Canada is not seen as a friendly 
jurisdiction to do business right now because of the complications we’ve
 had over the years. And that contrasts to other downturns where 
government and industry worked together to get some of these projects 
underway and did what it took to get it done. I’m not seeing that right 
now. I think the industry is on its own and you can expect more negative
 pressures here.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Leach, president of 
the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada (EPAC) agrees, saying 
the “unwelcoming business and investment climate that has developed in 
Canada in the last few years” has taken its toll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is a remarkable state
 of affairs for a country that relies heavily on the oil and gas 
industry to help balance its foreign trade, provide high paying jobs 
that supports equalization payments that flow from Alberta and 
Saskatchewan and contribute billions of dollars to federal and 
provincial coffers in royalties and taxes,” Leach said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It illustrates the 
inability of Canada’s political leadership at the federal and provincial
 levels to come together on what should be clear national interests: to 
make sure the nation’s non-renewable energy exports find markets at the 
highest world market price. It also illustrates the tremendously 
effective campaigns by industry opponents to influence politicians, 
policy and election outcomes in Canada.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Leach’s view, current 
government inaction and stance on some major energy projects runs 
counterintuitive to the nation’s best interests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I can’t think of another
 major energy producing nation, particularly among the world’s 
functioning democracies, with the potential Canada has to meet growing 
global demand, and yet has been so hobbled by its own governments in 
meeting that demand. Indeed, it’s no coincidence that a country like 
Canada with robust legal protection for the right to protest and with 
generous opportunities to intervene in the regulatory approval process, 
has attracted so much organized opposition,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s particularly 
disturbing when I think we can genuinely make the case there is no oil 
and gas industry in the world that has a better track record when it 
comes to responsible energy development. Even the head of the <span class="companylink">International Energy Agency</span>
 (Fatih Birol)in an October speech stated: ‘I wouldn't subscribe to the 
idea that we won't need oil anymore and a country like Canada, a 
reliable partner, a reliable producer, reliable exporter has a role to 
play in the global energy markets.’”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘Above ground issues’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Peter Tertzakian, executive director of ARC Energy Research Institute, 
said that while increased regulations are an issue, the challenges 
facing the oil and gas industry run much deeper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s broader than that. 
There’s the issue of Indigenous people and nimbyism—it’s just all 
wrapped up. It’s a very broad thing. I don’t want to be quoted as saying
 ‘it’s because of the government, or regulation or whatever.’ It’s far 
beyond that,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think it’s a large 
basket. I actually categorize it as ‘above ground issues.’&nbsp; The oil
 and gas industry has two dimensions. There’s the below ground issues of
 rock quality, the ability to get the stuff out of the ground, 
technology etcetera. So what’s happened is the below ground risks have 
diminished significantly over the last few years, but the above ground 
risks have been amplified,” Tertzakian added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And the above ground 
issues, all the way from local nimbyism to broad-based regulatory, to 
Indigenous issues and so on have increased. There’s no question that a 
lot of those above ground issues collectively are a drag on investment. 
It’s a very complex issue. I think we can agree that it’s the collective
 above ground dynamics that have hindered investment potential in 
Canada.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Duane Bratt, a political 
science professor at Calgary’s Mount Royal University, said the federal 
government’s decision to reorganize the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board (NEB) </span>has added to the challenges facing Canada’s oil and gas industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I do think the reorganization and the changes to the <span class="companylink">NEB</span>
 are significant. I don’t believe they’re the sole reason, or possibly 
even the major reason for the Energy East cancellation—I think the 
numbers that some economists have put forward talk about increased 
capacity and those sorts of things—but the fiddling with the <span class="companylink">NEB</span> is a problem,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Even if it wasn’t a 
problem with Energy East, it will be in other ones for a number of 
reasons. I think one of them is just the whole idea of looking at 
upstream and downstream effects. That becomes very complicated.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, Bratt is of 
the belief that the overall attractiveness of Canada’s oilpatch to 
would-be investors remains relatively intact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I would think our 
reputation remains quite good. It’s a politically stable country. Yeah, 
[governments] have brought in emissions standards and carbon taxes, but 
those carbon taxes are consumer-wide, economy-wide,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They’re not just focused
 solely on producers. I think it’s really about a cost issue. We’re a 
more costly economy to invest in, but a safer place to invest.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Combating the challenges: What can the industry do better?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bratt said that oil and gas industry efforts to obtain <b>social license</b> for large-scale projects and other industry-related initiatives have often fallen short.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And what’s interesting about that is you hear critics of <b>social license</b>
 say it’s a [Prime Minister Justin] Trudeau term or an [Alberta Premier 
Rachel] Notley term, but it’s not. It actually came out of the Canadian 
mining industry and has now been applied to larger types of projects, 
including those in the oil and gas industry,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you were to read Jim 
Prentice’s book [Triple Crown: Winning Canada’s Energy Future] or Dennis
 McConaghy’s book [Dysfunction: Canada After Keystone XL], they’re quite
 critical of the things that industry has done. And [industry] needs to 
share some of the blame for some of these [unsuccessful] projects, as 
well,” Bratt added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The MRU professor added 
that the oil and gas industry has done a relatively poor job in 
successfully informing the general populace of its successes and 
operational and environmental improvements, of which there are many.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The thing is, a lot of 
the work that industry has been doing on emission reductions in the 
oilsands, for example, I don’t think have been particularly well known 
and they have trouble getting that message out because for years, 
executives, and some of the industry groups, were denying there was ever
 even a problem,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Meanwhile, their 
scientists were working on ways of dropping emissions. So there’s 
actually I think some good news stories with some of the research and 
development that’s been done.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Canadian oil 
and gas sector has done better in recent years in its attempts to get 
its message across, Tamarack Valley’s Schmidt says there’s still work to
 be done in leveling the playing field against well-funded and organized
 opponents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think we have to 
realize that there’s a lot of money—and I would say out of country 
money—that’s coming in to campaign against the hydrocarbon industry 
here. And I think we’ve been far too complacent as an industry of just 
kind of letting that happen and then letting things go unanswered,” he 
said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So I think we need to be getting our message out there in different ways and more effectively and consistently.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leach believes that the 
industry has begun to successfully, for the most part, respond in recent
 years to the “shifting targets” of protesters who oppose energy 
infrastructure projects and the sector as a whole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We all remember the 
negative publicity around hydraulic fracturing and the industry and 
regulators effectively responded with science-based regulations and best
 practices to tackle concerns about chemical use, water consumption and 
induced seismicity. The target of opponents then shifted to pipelines 
where Canadian oil and gas producers are uniquely vulnerable due to 
government policy failures to ensure infrastructure was built when 
needed,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Ultimately I think the 
necessary pipelines and facilities to accommodate Canadian production of
 bitumen, liquids and natural gas in the next couple of decades will be 
built, but unfortunately years late. For example, both the B.C. and 
federal governments are signaling they are motivated to ensure that 
another LNG project does not fail.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leach added that the 
“evolving position” of the Alberta government on energy and pipelines is
 “proof attitudes can change, especially when you want to get 
re-elected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And as the disastrous 
effects of Ontario’s green energy policies on that province’s 
competitive position become more apparent to voters, we should expect a 
similar shift among a sufficient number of Canadian voters to influence 
national policies too,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not(ley) enough?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier Notley has embarked on a cross-Canada travelling road show to highlight the benefits of vital <b>pipeline</b> infrastructure, including in Vancouver and Central Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Schmidt, though appreciative, said that effort, that provincial government support, should have happened sooner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think [Notley] is 
doing the right thing in advocating for pipelines and how important they
 are to Canada. I don’t think Canadians, in general, understand how 
significant these projects are and how it impacts our ability to pay for
 health care and education and some of the things we enjoy right now,” 
he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think there’s a 
serious disconnect between the public and these pipelines. So I applaud 
Premier Notley for getting out and getting the word out, and she’s 
obviously going against some of her colleagues’ policies. So I think 
it’s good. But I think it’s too little, too late.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schmidt also said the attempt of the Notley government to attain <b>social license</b>
 for pipelines and other infrastructure by invoking a carbon tax and 
other environmental-directed measures may have not been the best laid of
 plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think the idea of getting so-called <b>social license</b> by giving into the Green movement and carbon taxes and that sort of thing really hasn’t worked,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think a far better 
strategy would be to compare how clean and how regulated our industry 
is. We’re the most regulated jurisdiction in the world. And that, I 
think, is something we should be very proud of as Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So not allowing our oil 
and gas to get to world markets just means the dirtier stuff and the 
stuff with conflict is going to get produced. I think that’s a better 
argument than carbon taxes or shutting down coal plants, that sort of 
thing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not the end of days</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the many issues 
and challenges facing the sector, Tertzakian said the Canadian oil and 
gas industry still has a viable future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think there’s a 
tendency for some to think that the whole industry is shut down. That’s 
far from the truth. The reality is that the industry is producing and 
exporting more oil and gas than ever. Consumers are consuming more than 
ever. Investment in certain segments of the business is showing signs of
 improvement,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So in some ways, given 
all these above ground issues, it’s remarkable that the industry 
continues to operate as well as it does. I would caution, though, it’s 
not just because of these above ground issues. There’s disruptive 
changes happening in the world of capital markets—migration to ETFs, for
 example.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tertzakian said that some
 companies are adapting to the “new realities” better than others and 
those that stumble in the needed transition likely won’t fare well going
 forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The industry is going to
 look different, recognizing that these above ground issues are unlikely
 to relent anytime soon,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The narrative I believe 
is that this industry is going to be part of what I call ‘the suppliers 
of the future.’ Those companies that understand above ground and below 
ground, those are going to be the suppliers of the future—those that 
know how to manage and execute amidst the disruptions we’re seeing both 
above ground and below ground.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DON MARTIN: All right. 
It's time for the long-awaited words of wisdom from the wild and 
wonderful, the national press gallery. I'll let you decide who's wild 
and who's wonderful. Stephanie Levitz is with the <span class="companylink">Canadian Press</span>, you're wonderful; Craig Oliver, the wild man, <span class="companylink">CTV</span>'s political commentator. I do want to bring in some breaking news because a regulatory authority on the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> <b>pipeline</b> has just come out with a ruling that basically lets <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 start construction over the objections of the town of Burnaby where it 
will end up as a terminal for this. It looks, Stephanie, like a green 
light for <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> now. Is the headache over for Justin Trudeau? Or John Horgan might have other plans here.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STEPHANIE LEVITZ (<span class="companylink">Canadian Press</span>):
 Yeah. I mean the issue here of course was that the federal government 
had approved this, right, in the city of Burnaby just to catch people 
up. The city of Burnaby was opposing it, and sort of in line with some 
of the politics right now in British Columbia. And so for the folks to 
step in and say, look, the federal government, the constitution says the
 feds own this one, it belongs to them, get going on it, is definitely a
 significant win for the Liberal government, but it doesn't solve the 
problem, the broader problem of <b>social license</b>, right, for the <b>pipeline</b>
 itself. If the city of Burnaby remains opposed, if the province of 
British Columbia remains opposed, it becomes still a political problem 
for the governing Liberals no matter what a court might say otherwise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CRAIG OLIVER (<span class="companylink">CTV</span>
 News): There's still an appeal in the federal court of course by six 
First Nations, and a couple of environmental groups, and the city of 
Burnaby and Vancouver who are challenging the whole thing on the basis 
that the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> did not 
adequately get enough consent from First Nations. And that's what killed
 one of the northern pipelines, that issue. In this case, though, my 
friend here is saying the federal government has already approved this 
and so has the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>. So the city of Burnaby had been throwing all kinds of roadblocks in the way by refusing permitting, and the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 went to the NEP and said, look, national energy program, and said we 
need to stop this, we're being tainted by the fact the opposition, the 
provincial government, and so many others, you have to deal with this 
because you approved this, and so did Ottawa approve it. And so today 
that one roadblock is gone, but there's still many others to go, but 
this was a big one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Okay. Let's move 
on because we'll just have to wait and see on that one. I do want to ask
 you about free trade. I mean we had John Manley on. He sounds a little 
pessimistic that we're not getting all our eggs in the basket that we 
need to get into to deal with the fact <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> might be going down the toilet. Craig, are we seeing the failure of our ability to negotiate free trades around the world?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: Well one has to 
observe that the incident in Beijing, in which the prime minister, 
everything seemed to fall apart. The prime minister went into that 
meeting expecting that he was going to be signing an agreement to launch
 a free trade negotiation, and it all came apart. The Chinese basically 
rejected the prime minister wanting to bring his domestic agenda to bear
 on a free trade deal, his progressive agenda involving women's rights, 
gender, labour, maybe the whole issue of whether Canada could depend on a
 decision in the courts there if there is a dispute between partners, 
all of that. And the Chinese said, no, what they want is strictly a 
business deal, and that's all they want. In fact they're beginning to 
sound like the Americans in the sense that they're saying take it or 
leave it. And the other issue here, which is similar, is that when we're
 dealing with the Americans, there's an asymmetrical relationship. They 
are powerful. We're not. And it's the same thing with China. They're 
saying you want to deal with us, you're going to have to get it our way.
 So this is the second time the prime minister has left the meeting in 
tatters, as he did in Vietnam in the case of the Trans-Pacific 
Partnership. And the Japanese are blaming Trudeau for the fact that that
 came apart when they were ready to make a deal. So one should worry, I 
think, about the state of our trade negotiations if everywhere you look 
three of them now are not going well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: I don't know, do fools rush in on these things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEVITZ: Well I was going 
to play devil's advocate on this a bit, because there's something 
interesting to be said about what the prime minister talked about in 
China when he was talking about trade as a driver of populism, right. 
And he talked about the issue with trade deals being that the ones 
historically have left people really falling behind, and governments 
have not done a good enough job putting in place trade deals and then 
subsequent other agreements, training programs, skills development, that
 compensate for the industries that end up getting hit negatively by 
trade deals. And so if the issue here for Mr. Trudeau and the Liberal 
government is truly to ensure trade agreements that actually benefit 
everyone, that, you know, bring the benefits of globalization home to 
everybody, then it's a question of him not being able to land those kind
 of trade deals. And is that really a bad thing? It's a fair question to
 ask, right. If <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> killed the textiles industry, is it fair to launch another trade deal that's going to kill off another industry?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: Yeah. Certainly 
one of the major drivers of populism in the world, and certainly in the 
case of Trump and the Republicans, was trade deals they said were bad 
for them. But who's going to say that we should not have a trade deal 
with China, especially when we don't know where the Americans are going,
 and the Chinese right now are feeling that they are now the centre of a
 new world order. They believe that you're going to have to trade with 
them whether you like it or not, and this is the way it's got to be. 
That's the way the Americans are acting also. I don't know how we can 
say we're not coming back, China, to consider this, and I think I agree 
with you, the way the prime minister wants to go, many Canadians support
 it. But do they support it at the loss of a trade and investment deal 
worth who knows how many jobs and how many billions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEVITZ: Part of it, too, 
is the narrative right. Like you have to wonder that the Trudeau 
Liberals have not lost control of the narrative on trade deals. To go 
into China and say we're going to walk out with a trade deal, that's a 
little aggressive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: And how could 
they have communicated that so many times and it failed so dismally? 
What went wrong? Again, the prime minister is not even going to explain 
what went wrong. MARTIN: I've got to move on. I do want to move on. The 
Supreme Court Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin made her farewell 
appearance in the court today. She was presiding over a case of free the
 beer, not an interesting way to go out. So she leaves the bench after 
28 years, and she had some parting words. Let's just hear what she had 
to say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEVERLY MCLACHLIN (<span class="companylink">Supreme Court</span>
 Justice): That brings me to thanking the Canadian public who are always
 behind us. We expect criticism. We often get it. And that's good in a 
democracy. Our decisions are there and open for comment and criticism. 
But what I have always felt is that the Canadian public generally 
supports its justice system and supports this court. And for that I am 
enormously grateful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Craig Oliver, great Albertan, might I say. Craig, what do you think is her legacy? Is there one?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: I think she has 
brought more social justice, humanity, she has opened up that court in a
 way it had never been opened up before to discussion, to some 
explanation of the kind of decisions they were making. She's just been 
one of the great chiefs of that court. And she was a woman, first woman 
in that job. She was an example long before many people thought that 
women were there, she was there, so she's greatly admired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Steph, I know you've covered a lot of court cases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEVITZ: I have, yeah.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: What have you observed about this chief justice?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEVITZ: Well you know 
it's interesting you say free the beer is an interesting case to go out 
on. I actually think it's one, it's a perfectly case for Beverley 
McLachlin, because in this sense she has opened up the court as Craig 
said, she's really tried to give access to justice for all Canadians, to
 give it its due, modernize the court, give more access to journalists, 
more access to the common citizen. So she's going out on a case that is 
really about opening the borders of provincial trade, opening the 
borders of boundaries, and giving Canadians access to beer. It's just 
sort of fitting, and I do, it's sort of fitting in her legacy. And she's
 a true trailblazer and Canada's own sort of Ruth Bader Ginsberg you 
know, and I hope that she continues speaking out publicly once she 
retires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Yeah. Well she's 
going to write a fictional book, apparently she's already got a 
publisher and the publisher has paid her a lot of dough, so I look 
forward to seeing that, because I agree with you, every time I've been 
over there watching her, she just brings an air of dignity to it. She'll
 be sadly missed. All right, I think she's doing a news conference next 
week so we'll bring that to you as well. Thank you both. Have a good 
weekend. We'll talk to you soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEVITZ: Nice to be here.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Webber, author and mechanical engineering professor at the University of Texas at Austin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Source: <span class="companylink">University of Texas at Austin</span>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineering professor 
Michael Webber is deputy director of the University of Texas at Austin's
 Energy Institute, where one of specialties is researching the 
intersection of energy infrastructure engineering and policy. S&amp;P 
Global Market Intelligence talked with Webber about the challenges 
natural gas pipelines face in the current political, regulatory and 
market environment, as well as potential remedies for the industry. The 
following is an edited transcript of the conversation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence: There have been some recent decisions stalling or, in some instances, even overturning <b>pipeline</b> project approvals. Is this a sign that courts are becoming more sympathetic to <b>pipeline</b> opponents, or instead are <b>pipeline</b> opponents' arguments becoming more sophisticated?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Webber: I don't 
think courts have changed their outlooks, necessarily. I do think the 
opponents have become more sophisticated in two ways. One, I think their
 coalitions are a little more diverse, so it's not just the 
environmental groups. They often bring in land-rights groups, and so 
they get a little more of an ideological spread that way. The other 
thing is they focus more of their effort on midstream rather than 
production sites. For a long time, opponents to oil and gas would focus 
on production to stop the extraction. Then they found over time that 
stopping the midstream is easier and it has the same effect because if 
you can't move gas to market, then you wouldn't produce in the first 
place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second piece to this is as time goes on, accidents happen. Every single accident of a <b>pipeline</b>,
 every spill or leak or problem, becomes part of the collection of 
evidence against pipelines. Time is on the side of the opponents. The 
more time goes on, the more accidents will happen, and that's used as 
part of the case to stop the construction of new pipes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think all projects are 
seeing the same kind of thing, which is more legal action at the 
midstream level, and more groups are brought to the table for that legal
 action. Every leak that happens just damns the case. The more leaks 
that happen, especially if it's the same company or <b>pipeline</b> or region, makes it that much harder to get approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is there anything developers can do to counter this momentum that opponents seem to have?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not sure what the best strategy is, but I think there are advantages if <b>pipeline</b>
 developers explain the relative safety of pipes versus trains. An 
alternative to moving by pipe is to move oil by train, for example, and 
trains have their own safety record that's problematic. They could talk 
about the comparative safety and cleanliness of the pipe versus the 
train.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other thing they 
could talk about is the comparative safety of piped gas than coal, for 
example, because there's less pollution from gas and [fewer] people will
 die from respiratory infection. They've got the argument that pipelines
 actually offer an environmental advantage, compared to rail or coal. I 
think you'll start to see that kind of thing happen more and more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What do midstream companies need to focus on in order to maintain their <b>social license</b>? Is that at risk in a post-Dakota Access and post-Keystone XL U.S.? If it is, how big of a risk factor are we talking about?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think it is a risk. The
 midstream sector needs to do a better job developing stakeholder groups
 they can communicate well with and explain the broader argument of why 
it's beneficial to have pipelines. It's ultimately something <b>pipeline</b>
 companies have done a bad job on, that sort of social engagement, and 
that's how they get opposition. It could be life or death for a certain <b>pipeline</b>, not necessarily to the companies, but if they can't get a <b>social license</b>, they can't get a permit, they can't build or operate the <b>pipeline</b>. Absolutely, it's a high-stakes situation for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking out to 2018, what's the one area you think <b>pipeline</b> companies should focus on to ensure that a project will be successful?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pipelines tend to be at 
their best when they are first built. Brand-new materials degrade over 
time because the soils shift or because of corrosion of the pipelines. 
The problem with pipelines is not year one, but maybe year 20, year 40 
in its lifetime. One way to deal with that is to build in a fund that 
accumulates money so when the money is needed to improve or replace a <b>pipeline</b>,
 the money is available. It's easier to do that early on before you need
 it than to wait until you need it to do it. I feel like that should be 
part of what's going on with pipelines is built-in funding for when 
inevitably a problem occurs, to avoid that problem and then to mitigate 
that problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is there anything else you want to mention that we have not covered?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The infrastructure of 
midstream, in general, is an important part of energy, not just for oil 
and gas and pipelines. Moving energy around is a difficult task and is 
required for all forms of energy.</p>

 ) in Alberta for the Trans Mountain approval, Enbridge's Line 3 
expansion <b>pipeline</b> got a little shortchanged on fanfare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Trans Mountain is more likely to get name-checked, the Alberta NDP constantly references the "two <b>pipeline</b> approvals" won on their watch, with the second one being Line 3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <b>pipeline</b> was 
approved last year - at the same time as Trans Mountain - and is a $8.2 
billion project, with $5.3 billion worth of it happening in Canada. The <b>pipeline</b> runs from Hardisty, AB to Wisconsin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan is to replace the existing Line 3 with a new <b>pipeline</b>, improving safety and boosting capacity, which perhaps explains why it flew under the radar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite that, Enbridge is

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy East and Northern Gateway</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These two pipelines are dead, although recriminations over why are still flying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northern Gateway ran into
 trouble, in part, because the courts believed the government hadn't 
adequately consulted with First Nations about the project. Alongside the
 decision to approve Line 3 and Trans Mountain, Trudeau also pulled the 
plug on Northern Gateway, saying it didn't serve the best interests of 
the affected communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy East was killed by <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> itself, and some blamed the burdensome regulatory environment for the company's decision. Others blamed the economics of the <b>pipeline</b>(

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a common thread running through all the new <b>pipeline</b>
 projects in Canada. With oil prices stagnating, competing shale oil 
showing no signs of slowing down and carbon pricing soon to be a reality

Let's go west to neighbours straddling the great divide to take the 
temperature of relations between the western-most provinces. To talk 
Alberta and BC politics, we're joined from Calgary by Mount Royal 
University political scientist Lori Williams and from Vancouver by 
"Globe and Mail" journalist Ian Bailey. Ian, we just had the Green Party
 leader on, upheaval in your province this year. How is that twin 
minority government working so far in your view? Andrew Weaver makes it 
sound like it's kumbaya and all.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IAN
 BAILEY (The Globe and Mail): Well, you know, this is a great 
opportunity for the Greens, something like Greens have had elsewhere, 
and I think Dr. Weaver is making the most of it in terms of the 
attention that he and his party gets on policy issues. I'm sure the 
Greens are positioning themselves for the next stage, which is the next 
election whenever it happens, in a bid to get, hold their three seats 
and get more than three seats. They're sniping at the NDP from the 
sidelines, disagreeing with them where they can, but they're not going 
to break that agreement, not for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: All right. Well, I
 got to switch over to the other side of the Rockies here and bring Lori
 in. Lori, there's talk of regime change in your province. Jason Kenney 
has reunited the Conservative parties under his leadership. How worried 
should NDP Premier Rachel Notley be?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LORI WILLIAMS (Mount 
Royal University): Well, I think this is obviously going to be a 
formidable opponent for her. Jason Kenney really knows what he's doing 
and he's been campaigning basically for a year and a half against the 
government. There are rumours within the party that they actually wanted
 Jason Kenney instead of Brian Jean, the other sort of frontrunner for 
the leadership of the new party, because they thought that Jason Kenney 
would be an easier person to campaign against. I think it's going to be 
really interesting to see what happens in the legislature when it rises 
in the New Year because we've got very different leadership styles here 
and Jason Kenney is quite tough and combative and we'll have to moderate
 that somewhat and Rachel Notley will probably have to be a little bit, I
 don't know, somehow more effective at dealing with some of the very 
real problems that her government has had, most notably the economy and 
the deficit. Unless those things turn around I think it's going to be a 
really tough fight for her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Let me stick with
 on you that, Lori. I mean, where is Jason going to go with that? What 
can Jason Kenney, what kind of targets has he got with Rachel Notley? 
What will he be proposing that's so dramatically different from the NDP 
and I assume he's going to take to bashing Ottawa as part of his ongoing
 assault on politics. How do you see how he's going to perform?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WILLIAMS: Well, he's 
going to bash everybody. He's already bashing even the PC policies. 
Seriously, he's talking about the negatives of the PC policies on 
education. He's going to go after Rachel Notley. He's very clear on this
 one, on the carbon tax. That's going to be an interesting argument 
because she's going to argue that this is giving <b>social license</b> 
to pipelines and, of course, this is where the BC part of the equation 
comes into play as well. She's going to be talking about <b>social license</b>.
 He's going to talk about fighting with Ottawa to protect Alberta. 
That's a bit of an older narrative. It will be interesting to see if 
that one really takes off or not. If it doesn't, I expect he'll sort of 
switch gears. He's also arguing against the job-killing policies, as he 
calls them, of the government. He's referring to them as socialists and,
 at least so far, he's been a bit overplaying his hand. He's been 
claiming that some of the policies are doing things that they aren't. So
 for example, the government is removing the residency requirements for 
voting in Alberta elections, as court decisions have required them to 
do, and he is suggesting that people can come in, vote in an election 
and then go back home wherever they came from, which just clearly isn't 
the case. So he's going to have to be careful because if he keeps on 
overplaying his hand he's going to lose credibility. He's going to have 
to nuance that a little bit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: All right. Ian, 
Lori got into this a little bit. There is a renewed friction between the
 two provinces and it's all called the Trans Mountain <b>Pipeline</b>. 
It's got approval federally, not locally, and Andrew Weaver said we're 
going to lie down in front of bulldozers if that's what it takes to stop
 this. How serious is this as a threat to sort of that western unity 
thing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAILEY: Well, you know, 
John Horgan campaigned against Trans Mountain. He has no choice but to 
sort of keep that opposition up, especially after his government 
recently approved a very controversial Site C hydro electric project in 
the north that they inherited from the BC Liberals. So, look for some 
really serious conflict here against this <b>pipeline</b>. The <b>pipeline</b>
 expansion, I'm sorry. I mean, Ms. Notley was in Vancouver not too long 
ago and was asked about this issue and basically suggested that, you 
know, she and Mr. Horgan are agreeing to disagree on this <b>pipeline</b>
 and sort of leaving it at that to see where this thing goes in terms of
 the courts and the various measures to try to stop it, but there's no 
doubt that as, you know, the work begins and continues on building this 
thing, or expanding this thing, it's going to be a really hot point here
 in British Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: I want to go back
 to you on this question of Justin Trudeau. Rachel Notley was pounding 
the pavement looking for, she was here in Ottawa looking to get support 
from the Trudeau government for a little more shoulder behind the wheel 
push on this <b>pipeline</b> construction. She needs, I guess she needs 
Justin Trudeau to sort of ride to the rescue here a bit and I'm sure 
Justin Trudeau will be more than happy to help her to make sure Jason 
Kenney doesn't get in that office. What are the expectations from Ottawa
 in Alberta?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WILLIAMS: Well, I mean, 
in terms of provincially, I think they will try to give support to the 
extent that they can, but it's a tricky question because, as you know, 
although we did get some Liberals and an NDP in the last election, a 
breakthrough to be sure, some of those representatives have gotten into a
 bit of hot water recently, Darshan Kang and Kent Hehr in Calgary, and I
 think Justin Trudeau has to look beyond Alberta to the entire country. 
If he pushes too hard in BC that could jeopardize some of his support in
 that province as well so I think this is going to be a very, very 
difficult matter to try to manage, both for Rachel Notley and Justin 
Trudeau, but I think it's pretty much the key. Unless construction is 
going forward on the <b>pipeline</b> in British Columbia then the 
argument that the carbon tax has actually given some sort of advantage, 
moved Alberta off the pariah pulpit, if you like, in terms of 
environmental opposition, unless it's generating some kinds dividends or
 benefits that's going to make it harder for Rachel Notley in the next 
election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: All right, Ian, 30 seconds or less. What are you are looking for in 2018? What's going to be the big surprise?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAILEY: Well the big 
surprise, I think the big expectation is the new NDP government here 
grappling with some of the big issues, housing, the opioid crisis, and 
other issues that they have promised, and $10 daycare from which they 
need money from the federal government, that they promised action on and
 are expected to sort of take measures on in the coming months, pretty 
soon. So that's going to be very interesting to see how that plays out 
here in British Columbia in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: All right. That will be interesting. All right, a lot to look forward to in 2018. Thank you both. Have a great holiday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAILEY: Same to you, Don.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WILLIAMS: Thanks.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DON MARTIN: Welcome back.
 Our Tuesday trio of MPs representing three major parties are here to 
dig into the auditor general's findings from other, different 
viewpoints, I suspect. Michelle Rempel is a Conservative MP from 
Calgary, and Nathan Cullen, an NDP MP from northern British Columbia. 
And for the defence, Liberal parliamentary secretary, Steve Mackinnon, 
who was handling like, you were handling all that Phoenix debacle today.
 That wasn't any fun for you at all, but, I think it's more interesting,
 you can't get through to pay your taxes.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NATHAN CULLEN (NDP - British Columbia): What?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: This is going 
with that tax narrative. These guys have the inability to deal with 
anything taxation-wise. What the heck, Steven Mackinnon? How come, how 
can they not get through to find out how much taxes I owe your 
government?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STEVEN MACKINNON (Public 
Services Parliamentary Secretary): Well, obviously it's not acceptable 
that citizens don't get this most elementary level of service and that's
 something that we're going to have to fix. And we've put in place an 
awful lot of things that will, in fact, fix it. We've invested, yes, in 
catching tax evasion, tax avoidance. We've invested in training. We're 
investing in technological solutions. You know, we have a 20-year-old 
phone system in that department. We have insufficient training. We have 
insufficient resources and there is a common thread that weaves through 
all of the elements of the auditor general's report today, and it's 
important to say that that was important work, and we accept, and 
accepted all his recommendations.</p>

ten years, in fact, we have had two years, and our, I think our track 
record's very good of reinvesting in the system, but we have inherited 
bad IT systems, a very bad infrastructure in the federal government.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Michelle, it's always your government's fault. How do you plead?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MICHELLE REMPEL 
(Conservative Immigration Critic): Look, to me, this at this point, is 
really about getting public servants paid. Prior to entering politics, I
 was involved in a much smaller scale legacy system renewal, in my 
previous job with a big institution, and it was hard. I mean, this is 
about selecting the right software and then making sure that you've got a
 plan in place to execute it. You know, our leader today mentioned...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: Would have been nice to see that in Phoenix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: Hey, let me finish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Let her finish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: Okay, well, 
since, since you're pushing me on this, the, you know, my leader today 
mentioned the fact that the Liberals actually had two reports presented 
to them saying don't press start. This is going to cause major problems.
 And they ignored that. You know, certainly when we were in government, 
Tony Clement today was saying, look, we got the same information. It 
wasn't ready. So, you know, I think the Liberals do have to take some 
responsibility for that decision, but then more importantly, what we 
need to measure now is how quickly the Liberals are fixing this problem 
because it's, it's not, it's, you know, they're talking about 
whole-of-government approach. It's a whole-of-government mess, like 
everybody's not being paid. And, you know, I don't think that's a 
positive thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: I was going to get to Phoenix later, but I was talking about the CRA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: Oh, sure, sorry. Sorry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: And your leader 
actually made a very interesting point. He says, you know, if my name 
was Stephen Bronfman, I would have got the prime minister to immediately
 give a ruling on taxes. Instead, I can't even get through to the CRA. 
What did you make of that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CULLEN: Okay, so the numbers are pretty impressive...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CULLEN: ...if you want to use that term. Half of all calls going into the revenue agency are not picked up at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Yeah.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Just ignored.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Yeah.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: Yeah.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Of, of those that
 make it through, one-third are getting bad, or wrong advice on their 
taxes. Here's what you should file. Here's how you should file. And a 
third of the time...</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: I knew where you were going there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CULLEN: ...it's a basic, 
basic function of government. And you extend that over to the Phoenix, 
which is just paying people for the work they did, and Michelle's right,
 when the Conservatives came up with this idea, took Phoenix off the 
shelf and said will this work? They had reports in front of them that 
said it will not. The Liberals had the same reports, and they said we're
 going ahead anyway...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: Not quite how it went down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CULLEN: No, no. I was there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: Well, and so was I.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CULLEN: I was there. No. No you weren't actually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Yeah, you were a rookie. You were a rookie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CULLEN: So, the Liberals 
ignored the advice and said no, we're going to start it anyways. The 
problem is this, for Canadians, is this is all costing people enormous 
amounts of stress. I have people in my riding losing their houses. We've
 had marriages been breaking up because they don't get paid for months. 
Students that worked for the federal government last summer, also not 
paid for months. So, they knew the problem was there. They ignored it. 
They went ahead. And we say, well, when is it going to be fixed? And the
 auditor general says we don't know.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: You've got to 
let me get this in. The choice facing the government was not Phoenix or 
the old system. The old system was gone. It had been retired. The people
 were fired by Mr. Harper.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Go ahead, Michelle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: Okay. Thank you. I
 guess two points. I want to make a point on these comments as well as 
the CRA issue. First of all, I'm putting myself in the shoes right now 
of somebody who hasn't gotten paid, who's watching this at home, and 
watching this happen, going just fix it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CULLEN: That's right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: Like nothing 
that's been said today is, how is this going to get fixed? How am I 
going to know that, that paycheque is coming? And really, what we need 
to hold the government to account to, and where the government needs to 
quickly go is saying this is how we're fixing it, rather than, you know,
 trying to diffuse blame, because we have to go forward. On the CRA 
thing, I just want to echo what Nathan said. You know, a lot of times 
the case work that we get in any of our offices are, are people who are 
having difficulties with CRA because they've gotten wrong information. 
And if the government is giving wrong information, I, they're, you know,
 I don't know what sort of liability is there...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CULLEN: Well, there's not because we have cases for people who got the wrong advice from CRA of how to file.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: And?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CULLEN: They lose, they lost their business...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: Yeah.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: It's a problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CULLEN: ...that's a fact 
and it's a huge problem for a government to pull back and say, it's, if I
 hear the Liberals say this is unacceptable one more time, I'm going to 
have to look up what unacceptable means, because it clearly is 
acceptable.</p>

 probably the biggest proportion of public servants in the country.</p>

years in. Why aren't we measuring you on what, like, you should be

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: We're going into a bit of a circle. I want to get Michelle expertise on this, because you're the immigration critic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: Yes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: What did you make
 of the refugee settlement thing? It sounds to me like the auditor 
general is saying the services, the money wasn't there to provide the 
services in the right location when they were needed for these Syrian 
refugees. What was your read?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: That's exactly 
right. Essentially, the report said what we've been saying all along, is
 that the emphasis was placed so much on, you know, the arrivals of the 
refugee rather than the hard work of providing integration services on 
the back end. The report confirms that we found in a parliamentary study
 that showed people were not getting access, timely access to language 
training services. The government isn't measuring basic things like 
whether or not children are able to attend school. So the, the report 
really exposed a flaw in the government's ability to provide integration
 support for refugees. And this is so off brand for the government, 
right? So for me, you know, I hope that this is, the report is a wake-up
 call for the government that, you know, these, these photo-op policies 
aren't good enough in terms of instilling confidence in the public to 
support <b>social license</b> for immigration, and that these are 
people. They're not numbers. And we have to be providing these services 
to them so that they have a successful experience here in Canada. It was
 a disappointing report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Nathan?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CULLEN: As complicated 
and hard as it is to get a large number of refugees out of war-torn 
areas, and get them to Canada, the actual even larger work is making 
sure they're successful when they get here. The government spent a great
 deal of time and energy and there was some photo-op aspect to this of 
welcoming this many refugees to town, to Canada without the plan in 
place to support them. That's what the auditor general told us. I think 
Michelle's point is well taken that if we want broad support for 
refugees to be able to come to Canada, immigration in general, Canadians
 need to see the program as successful for those people and those 
families as they come into Canada, rather than unsuccessful, which we've
 seen in Europe and other places. So, more than a wake-up call, this is 
a, a serious thing, longer-term beyond even just these families who are 
impacted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Yeah, we've got to get them integrated successfully, or else this is going to be non-stop...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: Yeah. But, you
 know, there are so many great stories out there, and what they call 
photo-op, very cynically, is actually an example to the world. And we 
have mobilized, the federal government has...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CULLEN: Did you read the auditor's report?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACKINNON: ...enormous 
resources, enormous resources to welcome this number of refugees to 
Canada. Things have gone very well. Things have happened very quickly. 
And the entire government was involved. Canadians should be very proud 
of how we are leading the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CULLEN: Did we read the same auditor general's report?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: I, I don't think so.</p>

that things aren't going well. And my concern is for, you know, I've 
been a passionate advocate for...</p>

reality is, it's like we're hearing things like people don't have access
 to interpretation services. They don't have access to healthcare. I had
 an official tell me in committee that only five of these women have 
been able to access one-on-one counselling support. So, it's like, the 
back end is what we need, right?</p>

Donald Trump may have saved Rachel Notley's political hide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Admittedly, an NDP win remains a real long shot in the 2019 election.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for the NDP to have any shot, at least one major <b>pipeline</b> has to be under construction by the time the election is called in the spring of 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot else has to be going right, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price of oil has to 
continue its climb from where it is now (in the $55US range) to around 
$70US. The NDP have to reduce spending and begin to get their deficit 
under control. And tens of thousands of energy-sector workers have to be
 back working again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, if the Alberta 
economy is humming when the election is called two years from now, there
 is an extremely narrow path to victory for the New Democrats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Keystone XL (KXL) is the <b>pipeline</b> most likely to be under construction by 2019, Notley and the NPD owe their tiny sliver of hope to the U.S. president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, it was Trump who agreed to give federal permits to the $8-billion <b>pipeline</b> project back in March. That reversed seven years of stalling and, finally, outright rejection by the Obama administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, technically, it was Monday's approval by the <span class="companylink">Nebraska Public Service Commission</span>
 that removed the last official hurdle to Keystone XL. But without 
Trump's approval first, the Nebraskans wouldn't even have made a 
decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot can still go wrong. <span class="companylink">TransCanada Corp</span>.
 might decide not to go ahead with the 1,800-km extension of their 
existing Keystone line that would connect Alberta's oilsands with a <b>pipeline</b> hub in Cushing, Oklahoma.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> cancelled the Energy East <b>pipeline</b>
 in October, it did so mostly because of environmental hurdles erected 
by Justin Trudeau's federal Liberal government. But to the extent that 
decision was economic, Keystone might prove to be equally uneconomic..</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American courts might 
also side with environmentalists or Nebraska ranchers and issue 
injunctions against construction. Or protestors might block construction
 for weeks or months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, Keystone is far from a done deal just yet, although it remains the most likely major <b>pipeline</b> to actually get built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be a shame 
though if Keystone helped Notley get re-elected. At the very best, her 
attitude towards the project has been lukewarm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our premier has held many
 positions on Keystone, but she has probably been opposed or indifferent
 more than she has been in favour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Notley and the NDP were in opposition before the May 2015 election, they were clearly against the <b>pipeline</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then during the campaign 
they sent mixed messages. Candidate Rachel Notley told the Edmonton 
Sun's editorial board she was in favour of Keystone. Later she told the 
CBC's Evan Solomon "we're against it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly after being sworn
 in as premier in May 2015, her federal NDP brethren came out staunchly 
against Keystone during the federal election. Notley refused to 
repudiate their stance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Barack Obama 
announced he was blocking Keystone in November 2015 - the same month the
 New Dems came out with their carbon tax and climate leadership plan - 
Notley refused to go to Washington to complain. She made it clear she'd 
rather Keystone didn't go ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the last U.S. 
presidential race, when Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton declared 
herself against Keystone, Notley said she and Clinton were on the same 
page.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Trump was elected in November 2016, Notley refused once again to go to D.C. to lobby for Keystone saying it "was not key."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, I suppose, because her "<b>social license</b>" strategy has failed so miserably to get a single Canadian <b>pipeline</b> built, maybe that's why Notley has suddenly become such a big booster of Keystone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Donald Trump has become Rachel Notley's last, best chance of a second term.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later
 this month, Premier Rachel Notley will set off on a cross-Canada 
speaking tour to try to drum up support for pipelines, specifically for 
the already-approved Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is an effort all Albertans can support, no matter what one thinks of her and her government.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We all need her rhetorical diplomacy to succeed. Our province's future prosperity needs <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> to be built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trans Mountain expansion is, essentially, the twinning of a <b>pipeline</b> that has operated safely since the 1950s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It should be a slam dunk.
 It will take up almost no new land, cross no lakes or rivers it does 
not already cross. Its increased infringement on First Nations land will
 be negligible after construction is complete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that hasn't stopped 
environmentalists from going hysterical, particularly since the federal 
government approved the line almost exactly a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environmental activists 
have threatened to fight the expansion in the courts and "in the woods,"
 by which they mean demonstrations, sit-ins and, perhaps, even domestic 
terrorism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Karen Mahon - 
who until June was one of Notley's closest advisors on oilsands 
development (Mahon wanted none) - and around 60 other "green" activists 
kayaked out into Vancouver's Burrard Inlet and chained their boats to a <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> construction barge. Five, including Mahon, were arrested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason Notley has
 to be convincing on her cross-country speaking tour: For too long she 
has been far, far too cozy with eco-crazies who firmly believe all 
pipelines are the work of corporate devils, that they all must be 
stopped and that in their place Canada's economy can be powered by 
unicorn farts and fairy wands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During her tour at the 
end of the month, Notley has to convince investors and voters, both, 
that her days of trying to get pipelines approved by currying favour 
with eco-activists through carbon taxes and emission caps are done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What she calls "<b>social license</b>" has scared away investors and deepened and lengthened Alberta's recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This upcoming tour has to be her last gloves-on attempt to get a <b>pipeline</b> through to the coast. If this doesn't work, the gloves have to come off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the "kayaktivists" arrested along with former Notley advisor Mahon - Liam Fox, a <span class="companylink">Simon Fraser University</span> grad student - promised their stunt was only the beginning. "We don't have any other option. This <b>pipeline</b> has to be stopped."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mahon herself pledged "you are going to see a rise of resistance like (B.C.) hasn't seen before."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, of course, B.C.'s new NDP government is also pledged to stopping the line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If activists are going to do "whatever it takes" to stop <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>,
 Notley has to lead those who will do whatever it takes to get it built.
 There is no other natural leader for the propipeline effort. And the 
premier's national tour is the perfect place for her to prove she 
possesses that determination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because if she won't do whatever it takes, you can bet new UCP Leader Jason Kenney will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Alberta desperately needs pipelines (plural) built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study of the NDP's deficit spending and accumulating debt, released last week by the <span class="companylink">University of Calgary</span>'s school of public policy, shows how utterly unsustainable their spending spree is without more and more oil revenues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, while the 
NDP insists the province's debt will increase by $27.2 billion over the 
next three years, the U. of C. study says the reality could easily be 
closer to $38.9 billion - over 40 per cent above the Notley government's
 estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That should give the premier incentive to do some impassioned talking on her tour.</p>

 - In an ornate ballroom in one of downtown Calgary's few Edwardian 
hotels, hundreds of dark-suited men and women gathered over lunch 
Tuesday to hash out one of the questions festering at the heart of 
Alberta's politics: What really happened to Energy East?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> <b>pipeline</b>
 was intended to be a win-win project: Alberta would gain access to 
tidewater for its beleaguered bitumen; oil would travel to a refinery on
 Canada's east coast; resources would stay in the country. But in 
October the company killed it, inspiring interprovincial rancour and 
darkening the province's increasingly sour mood.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter to the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>
 explaining its decision, the company cited "delays resulting from the 
regulatory process," among other obstacles. Andrew Leach, a professor of
 energy policy at the University of Alberta and one of the architects of
 Alberta's climate change policy, was among the loudest voices crying 
foul over <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s implication. 
Canning Energy East was a reasonable business decision inspired by low 
oil prices, reduced oilsands production forecasts and the imminent 
approval of Keystone XL, Leach had argued publicly in the wake of the 
announcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, Leach gathered with Dennis McConaghy, <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s
 former executive vice-president of corporate development, and Martha 
Hall Findlay, president of the Canada West Foundation and once a Liberal
 MP for a Toronto riding, to hash the matter out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leach contended that 
Energy East's fate was clear once Trump was elected. Oil prices are low,
 production predictions have been slashed, and once Keystone XL was back
 on the table, the less-efficient Energy East was doomed. "It was the 
most expensive of the <b>pipeline</b> projects, so the one you naturally take off the deck," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Energy East panel, left to right: Andrew Leach, Dennis McConaghy and Martha Hall Findlay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McConaghy took issue with
 that position. Energy East already had shipping contracts lined up, he 
said, and while Alberta might indeed maintain adequate <b>pipeline</b> supply if both Keystone XL and the TransMountain <b>pipeline</b>
 are approved, the fate of those two projects is still uncertain. 
(Keystone XL is still awaiting sign-off from Nebraska's state 
government, while TransMountain must face an interprovincial 
intransigence so entrenched that Alberta premier Rachel Notley plans to 
go on a cross-country road trip to support the project.) Energy East 
would have been a viable third option, and oil companies were willing to
 pay the price of potentially having too much capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The real tragedy of losing Energy East was that a set of circumstances evolved to reach a point where <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>
 couldn't just suspend the project, but went on to terminate it, and 
that was fundamentally driven by a conviction they could never get the 
permit," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The regulatory process 
has simply become so unpredictable that no sane company will throw 
billions of dollars behind a project that can be cancelled on a 
political whim, just as Northern Gateway was, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is total 
uncertainty in this country about whether we can get anything built," 
Hall Findlay said, adding that among resource companies Canada was 
beginning to acquire the reputation for political uncertainty of a 
banana republic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no political 
clarity around what this country wants or what it will approve, she 
added. The approvals process is now taking decades, in hopes of creating
 a <b>social license</b> that will never be granted by staunch 
anti-oilsands activists. The cost of that delay for business can reach 
hundreds of millions of dollars per month.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McConaghy said that if 
the government wants to impose an even-handed carbon strategy, well, 
fine. Just make that clear upfront and apply it to all industries 
equally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not like these 
points haven't been made to the Trudeau government," he said. The 
government heard all these gripes and then "dismissed all the actual 
problems and instead advocated for more open-ended engagement, as if the
 regulatory process were a focus group as opposed to a technocratic 
exercise."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the eyes of both Hall 
Findlay and McConaghy, nothing exemplified this more than Energy East. 
After the regulatory process had begun, the <span class="companylink">NEB</span>
 said that it would take into consideration greenhouse gas emissions 
from the oilsands and the oil burned after it left the line rather than 
just the emissions of the actual <b>pipeline</b>. This was untenable, 
they argued, the sort of standard that would never be applied to central
 Canadian industries. It would be like judging the approval of an auto 
plant based on the lifetime emissions of all the cars it produced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The final straw was moving the goalposts," Hall Findlay said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Establish what the 
strategy is and then let our regulatory bodies implement those 
directions. But let them do their jobs. If every decision then comes 
back to what is a political win, we will not get anything done."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> executives announce the company's Energy East <b>Pipeline</b> project on Aug. 1, 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there was no doubt in
 Hall Findlay's mind that the cancellation of Energy East was celebrated
 in the Prime Minister's office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When that announcement 
was made, there were champagne bottles popping in Ottawa," she said. As 
the Liberals face more competition from the NDP, the <b>pipeline</b> "would have been a major, major headache for the federal Liberals."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite this, both Hall 
Findlay and Leach warned about the increasingly vicious rhetoric 
currently being bandied about across provincial lines: UCP leader Jason 
Kenney has said he would scrap Alberta's carbon tax and cut permits to 
oil pipelines feeding B.C. if it continues to stall the TransMountain 
expansion. Those threats only add to the culture of political 
uncertainty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But McConaghy nonetheless echoed the darker sentiment now rippling through much of the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think it's naive to 
think that in a scenario where Keystone XL doesn't happen because of 
Nebraska and TransMountain (falters) because the federal government 
didn't enforce (its regulatory approval, the idea that Alberta is going 
to be saying 'We stepped up. We applied the most stringent carbon tax in
 the country and you stiffed us on market access,'" he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"No one should think the political reaction to that isn't going to be extreme."</p>

 expansion in British Columbia faces a fresh challenge, Premier Rachel 
Notley will speak to business crowds in three provinces in an attempt to
 build support for the controversial project considered critical for 
Alberta's energy sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley said in an 
interview Sunday she will bring her sales pitch to Toronto, Ottawa, 
Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver later this month in the hopes of 
convincing more Canadians the Trans Mountain expansion project is in the
 country's best interest.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We
 are a very small economic player internationally, and we punch well 
above our weight, but we're not going to be able to do that if we become
 paralyzed by very parochial decision-making," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The oil and gas industry
 continues to contribute significantly to national economic growth... To
 walk away from it is negligent. It's economically negligent."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s project, already faced 
with legal challenges, has been met with new resistance in Burnaby, 
B.C., where the municipal government has not issued permits to allow for
 the $7.4-billion <b>pipeline</b> expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arguing Burnaby is intentionally delaying construction, the company has asked the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>
 to intervene and allow for work to begin. That city counters it is 
following its process for reviewing similar development applications and
 rejects the idea it is dragging its feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta will throw its support behind <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> before the <span class="companylink">NEB</span>, which may review the case through written submissions or a short hearing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While United Conservative
 Party Leader Jason Kenney has publicly mused about potential economic 
retaliation against B.C., if that province is successful in blocking or 
stalling <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s project, Notley said she's not interested in "irresponsible sabre-rattling."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're going to make the 
case in a reasonable and responsible way as long as the matter is still 
alive, which it is," the premier said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley, who begins her 
tour Nov. 20 at the Empire Club of Canada in Toronto, may be preaching 
to the converted as she appears before pro-development business crowds 
across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she speaks at the 
Greater Vancouver Board of Trade Nov. 30, her audience will likely be 
sympathetic, but it will give her a platform to reach other British 
Columbians who can be swayed, as she attracts local media attention, 
said George Hoberg, a professor at the University of British Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I suspect her goal is to
 reach the political middle in B.C., to make the best case to those who 
are not in the camp of active, adamant opponents," Hoberg said in email 
exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That audience is critical to how responsive the (B.C.) NDP government is likely to be to <b>pipeline</b>
 opponents. It will also be very important in the dynamics of protest 
and police response that will occur, should construction ramp up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hoberg, who teaches 
environmental and natural resource policy, also warned that "First 
Nation and environmental opponents to the <b>pipeline</b> will do their best to greet Notley and make sure their message continues to get attention as well."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley said her 
government - which has attempted to secure support for pipelines by 
imposing a climate change agenda that includes a carbon tax and cap on 
oilsands emissions - has "reasonable levels of credibility" among 
Canadians who are concerned about the environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are people who still can have their mind changed, and it's important to get the facts out there," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prasad Panda, energy 
critic for the United Conservative Party, supports Notley's move but 
argues she should have invited him and other opposition MLAs to join her
 in a united front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Panda said he believes 
Notley genuinely backs the oil and gas industry, but he questioned her 
decision making, having appointed environmentalists Tzeporah Berman and 
Karen Mahon to an oilsands advisory panel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were among several 
panelists who were excused in June, not because of their beliefs, but 
because the group's focus had shifted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both activists have openly opposed the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b>. Mahon was recently arrested after she and three other protestors took to kayaks and roped themselves to a barge near <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s marine terminal in Burnaby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For the last two years, 
(Notley) was living in a fool's paradise thinking that by imposing a 
carbon tax and by imposing the cap on oilsands development, she would 
get <b>social license</b>, but that is not the case," Panda said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kinder Morgan chief 
executive Steve Kean recently warned that delays in securing permits and
 regulatory approvals could put the project nine months behind schedule,
 though the company is exploring measures to speed things up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has also 
warned that every month of delay from its planned December 2019 
in-service date would directly cost as much as $35 million, and another 
$90 million a month in lost revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The B.C. government has vowed to use any means at its disposal to stop the project, which would twin <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s
 existing line, more than tripling its capacity and getting more Alberta
 crude to tidewater for export. It also faces legal challenges by 
environmentalists, Indigenous communities and B.C. municipalities.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If
 Premier Rachel Notley wants to continue to dismiss opposition to 
pipelines by her federal and British Columbia NDP counterparts, she 
should lobby to make the Alberta party a distinct identity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike parties such as 
the Liberals, the New Democrats are integrated at the provincial and 
federal levels. So when Albertans sign up to support Notley and her 
colleagues, they automatically become members of the federal NDP. That's
 why it's strange to hear Notley say federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh's 
hostility toward pipelines is of no consequence.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm
 not going to get too wrapped up in what people who are not in 
government are doing in other parts of the country, in hypothetical 
conversations, over which they have no agency," Notley said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certainly, it's true that as the leader of the third largest party in <span class="companylink">Parliament</span>,
 Singh isn't in a position to give a green light or red light to energy 
projects, but the optics are terrible. Notley's federal leader is going 
around the country whipping up opposition to projects her government 
says are not only in Alberta's interest, but in the national interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More jarringly, her 
British Columbia NDP cousin, Premier John Horgan, has pledged to use 
every tool at his disposal to block the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> <b>pipeline</b> expansion, which was approved by the federal government and his predecessor, Christy Clark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not uncommon to have
 disagreements within families, but surely Notley must realize it's 
untenable to have her colleagues working against her in such bold 
fashion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Singh was in Vancouver on
 Friday, where he said he has three criteria that must be met for any 
energy projects to be approved - that Indigenous rights are respected, 
that Canada can meet its climate change goals if the <b>pipeline</b> 
goes ahead, and that the projects prioritize local jobs. Neither Trans 
Mountain nor the now-shelved Energy East projects met those criteria, 
said Singh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the federal leader praised Notley for her government's initiatives directed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It needs to be pointed 
out, Premier Notley has the most aggressive and comprehensive climate 
change policy in Canada. We won't achieve our climate goals if we don't 
have a premier like Rachel Notley in Alberta," said Singh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ah, that would be the same climate change plan that was supposed to earn so-called <b>social license</b> for pipelines - support that hasn't been forthcoming from Singh and Horgan and their sort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Alberta's NDP party has different views than its federal counterpart, it should take steps to separate the two organizations.</p>

 burned, perhaps as fuel to power Quebecmade Bombardier jets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NEB's overreaching

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Infrastructure Minister Amarjeet Sohi said the move by <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> was a business decision and he dismissed suggestions the culprit was the NEB's new rules.</p>

careful review of these factors, the existing and likely future delays

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not only an embarrassment that the <b>pipeline</b>'s

timely fashion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even pipelines that have been approved are met with opposition and legal challenges, raising doubts about the so-called <b>social license</b> the NDP imagined its provincial carbon tax would earn.</p>

 right now, it's becoming glaringly obvious the ongoing, two-year-long 
strategy of borrowing a fortune while hoping Alberta's economy does one 
of those bust-to-boom routines is wearing thin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in the springtime, 
there was a little jaunt in the step of the treasurer when he spoke of 
green shoots, followed by a glint in the premier's eye as she waxed 
lyrical about turning some corner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, six months on and 
halfway through this dismal financial year, that jaunt is morphing into a
 limp and the corner looks as though it leads to Dead End Street. Nope, 
things are not rebounding the way the government undoubtedly expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just like our current 
backyards, those green shoots are gone and a season of reckoning is upon
 us. Thoughts of sure-fire, rapid growth are now only for the foolish or
 criminally optimistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which, in political 
terms, means this government's strategy is hitting a brick wall 
comprised of stubbornly high unemployment and dangerously worrisome 
levels of borrowing. Halfway through their mandate and Notley's crew are
 running out of time, because if things don't change soon, they are done
 like the proverbial dinner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month is already proving a nightmare. First came news <span class="companylink">TransCanada Corp</span>. is pulling out of the Energy East <b>pipeline</b>
 project after facing so much criticism, political grandstanding and 
shifting regulatory sands they probably breathed a huge sigh of relief 
despite the disappointment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was no relief in Edmonton, however. This was a body blow to the government's much-ballyhooed <b>social license</b>
 strategy, in which we all get whacked with a carbon tax with the 
explicit promise this would make the rest of Canada all warm and cuddly 
toward Alberta pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nope, that longed-for 
love-in didn't get too far. So now all eyes, and a heck of a lot of 
votes, are tied to measurable progress of the westward-ho <b>pipeline</b>
 project, otherwise known as the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain expansion,
 a project that the government across whose territory it must proceed is
 intent on delaying and ultimately ditching. Yes, our prime minister is 
on board, but remind me again how many federal seats the Grits hold here
 in Alberta?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As if that wasn't bad enough, we had the latest woes our monthly labour statistics provide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news is 
unemployment fell to 7.9 per cent, but delve just slightly below the 
surface and that appears like that old joke about the man who's just 
lost a leg getting a decent offer on his slippers. The reason it went 
down is the labour force fell - at this rate, we'll have nobody out of a
 job because everyone's quit looking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of people 
working in September actually fell by 7,800. Now perish the thought the 
looming minimum wage hike could have had anything to do with that - but 
the fact is the biggest drop came in accommodation and food service 
employment, where many such low-paid jobs reside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No doubt the close to 
8,000 jobs in that sector that vanished in the month prior to the 
mandated pay hike would just be statistical noise to Labour Minister 
Christina Gray. In her cosy world, the metadata is already counted and 
there'll be no turning back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's symptomatic of the
 bigger problem. Other than hoping oil prices suddenly ratchet skyward, 
there's no other plan to reduce our enormous borrowing binge, as any 
suggestion of trimming spending is greeted with shrieks of brutality and
 heartlessness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except time is running 
out and hope isn't a strategy. So now, in the second half of her 
mandate, Premier Rachel Notley needs to rethink this government's 
policies, because, as in Ecclesiastes 3, there is a time to keep and a 
time to cast away.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DON MARTIN: Welcome back.
 Our Thursday MP combo of diverse political opinion joins us to talk 
pipelines, plaques, and a phoenix which refuses to rise. Ruby Sahota is a
 Liberal MP from Brampton, Michelle Rempel a Conservative MP from 
Calgary, and the pride of Essex, NDP MP Tracey Ramsey. Welcome to you 
all. Michelle, you heard Jim Carr. Tell me what's the view of Calgary on
 this. What's your reaction, Energy East I'm talking about?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MICHELLE
 REMPEL (Conservative – Alberta): You know, if the Liberals wanted to 
completely shut down the energy sector, I wish we would have just had 
that policy discussion, or the courage to have that policy discussion in
 parliament. The reality is between the carbon tax, which is not going 
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, between even the small business tax 
issue this week, the changing of the rules for major energy projects 
which require a large capital investment, certainly the downstream 
emission review on this, like, come on, we're not reviewing Saudi oil 
for that. The tanker moratorium that, they actually shut down debate on 
the tanker moratorium bill after only two opposition speakers this week.
 I could go on and on. The reality is all of these things combined is an
 ideological opposition to the energy sector. You heard Jim Carr talk 
about the pipelines that they approved. Well, we approved four pipelines
 under our government. So that's fact. The other component is that the 
government, they refuse to stand up and acknowledge that many First 
Nations communities actually want some of these pipelines to be 
produced. We already have one of the world's strongest regulatory 
systems in the world, and I wish that they would have just had the 
courage to call it national energy program the second, but they were 
smart enough not to. The unfortunate thing is I think that this is going
 to stoke western alienation. I think that this is going to hurt the 
entire economy writ large, and their talking points are very, very weak 
and they're not cognizant of the reality that the energy sector plays in
 the Canadian economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Okay. It is an 
engine of growth out there. Tracey, where is the NDP coming down on 
Energy East? Is this a business decision or political obstruction? 
TRACEY RAMSEY (NDP – Ontario): Well this isn't a surprise because the 
system is broken that we're using. The process that we're using is 
broken. We've been saying that for a very long time. You have to include
 <b>social license</b>. You have to include the communities that are 
impacted. And here we saw the municipalities saying that they didn't 
want this, having the province weigh in. Like when you have people in a 
community who are objecting to what you're doing, then you have to take a
 serious look at that. Until they fix this process, don, you know, no 
project really is going to go through in the way that it should. It's 
not going to have every single aspect looked at, and know that that 
project is good for Canada. We're happy to see this happen. Obviously 
this is something that we were calling for. But it's not a surprise, and
 it's just another example of how the government needs to listen to the 
people in the communities that are impacted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: So, Ruby, I'm sure you want to weigh in somewhere between those two polar opposites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RUBY SAHOTA (Liberal – 
Ontario): Absolutely. Government has been listening, and therefore 
that's why we have a process that has been working and takes into 
account what Indigenous people are saying. It takes into account the 
issue with the emissions. And we have successfully, under this exact 
same process, the process has not changed regardless of what the 
Conservatives want to sell to people, the process is the same and we've 
approved three pipelines since that time. Two oil pipelines, <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>, Line 3, a gas <b>pipeline</b>,
 Nova Gas, and that's created over 25,000 jobs. How many jobs did the 
Conservatives create in that area? Zero! Because you did not, the fact 
is you did not...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: Whoa, whoa, Ruby, come to Calgary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAHOTA: ...any oil pipelines in ten years. We've approved three.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: Keystone, Anchor 
Loop, the Line Nine reversal. Wrong, wrong, wrong, and the reality is 
that there's over 200,000 people that are out of work in Alberta. So 
anybody in Alberta that's talking about jobs created under the Trudeau 
government are actually going to be throwing tomatoes at their screen 
right now. That is such complete malarkey. And I just wish, again, I 
mean we're going to continue to stand up for the energy sector, but I 
think what everybody is going to be doing today is looking at the 
Trudeau government and saying, look, why didn't you just have the 
courage to stand up and say we don't want this to happen. Why just try 
and trick Canadians into thinking anything otherwise?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAHOTA: We absolutely wanted it to happen. It was a business decision at the end of the day made by <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: But why isn't Canada open for business on this? If it's a business... SAHOTA: We're absolutely open to business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: No, what you've 
done is you've, you have changed the rules on a billion dollar capital 
decision. You have changed the rules on the taxation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: You have changed rules and the context and labour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Go ahead Tracey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RAMSEY: This is an 
example of how broken the process was under the previous Conservative 
government. It continues to be under the Liberals. And until this 
process gets fixed, it has to get fixed. This is broken. We saw the 
social licence today coming to play, communities coming into play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: What exactly is broken about this?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RAMSEY: Listening to 
communities. You have to take into account the communities that this is 
traveling through, not just where it's coming and where it's going 
through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: I got to move on. We're running out of time and I want to get to this issue because the "<span class="companylink">New York Times</span>", the "<span class="companylink">Washington Post</span>", the "Times of Israel", the "<span class="companylink">BBC</span>"
 are all covering the story of the missing mention on our brand new 
national holocaust memorial down there. There's no mention of the Jewish
 population that was exterminated in the gas chambers. All we've got in 
place is that millions of men, women, and children were murdered during 
the holocaust, and the survivors who persevered were able to make their 
way to Canada after one of the darkest chapters in history. The plaque 
didn't mention anything about Jews. It has since been removed. The 
government, like what's your reaction to this?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RAMSEY: This is a very 
serious oversight. You know this, we're glad that it's down, but this is
 a very serious oversight that's hurtful to people who are in Canada who
 are descendants of people who are Jewish who faced anti-Semitism. There
 needs to be an acknowledgment of what exactly happened there, and it 
can't be this kind of just vague reference to the amount of people that 
were murdered in the holocaust, so it needs to be fixed. It's just a 
very unfortunate and really a big mistake by the Liberals not catching 
that this should have been an important piece.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: How can you not 
proofread a plaque, or did they just decide they couldn't single out one
 set of victims and decide just to lump it in as men, women and 
children. What did you think when you heard this?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: I guess two 
points. First to that, you know, if you go to any holocaust memorial 
around the world, be it Yad Vashem, or the American holocaust memorial, 
the communities that built those take great pains to talk about the 
Roma, or Jehovah's Witnesses, or members of the LGBTQ community that 
were also included, but the reality is I think a key component of 
anti-Semitism to this day is people who purport that the Jewish 
community somehow made the holocaust up. And the main way that we can 
fight anti-Semitism is by strongly pushing back, and saying unless we 
recognize how many members of the Jewish community were killed simply 
because of their faith under extreme conditions, the saying never again 
won't actually happen. So, you know, this is a pretty big oversight, and
 one that I'm glad was corrected. But I mean, yes, proofreading a plaque
 should have happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: And a bit of a 
global, I mean laughing stock is the wrong word, but certainly we're 
being held up to ridicule around the globe for this. I mean surely 
someone, who should be held responsible for this, Ruby?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAHOTA: I don't disagree 
with anything my colleagues have said. It is a time in our history that 
needs to be acknowledged, and we need to learn from it. We need to call 
it what it was, and, you know, over six million Jews died, so there was 
no excuse. We really appreciate that (inaudible) flagged the issue right
 away and immediately it was removed. On the monument overall, there are
 over 50 mentions of the Jewish people, but this plaque in particular 
had that oversight, and I don't know how that happened but I'm really 
grateful that it was flagged and removed and it's going to be corrected,
 rightfully so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: I know. Well we 
were supposed to talk phoenix, but I'm out of time. And I think phoenix 
is going to continue to flounder around for a while.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: We just want people to get paid, like me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARTIN: Are you having trouble getting paid?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMPEL: MPs aren't 
supposed to get paid, Don, but, no, I think it's, you know, across party
 lines, this is really affecting a lot of public servants and they need 
to, it needs to be fixed. MARTIN: Okay. Well we'll save the blame game 
for another time. All right, thank you all. Have a great break week and a
 happy Thanksgiving. Coming up, fighting back against the military's 
silent killer. Please stay with us.</p>

Bunz, a 38-year-old salesman supplying chemicals to oil and gas 
facilities, lay in a shack 80 kilometres from the Galloway house, dead 
after being exposed to H2S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The official incident 
report filed with the Ministry of the Economy, which regulates 
Saskatchewan's oilfields, makes no mention of Bunz's death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These regulators "are 
really thinking about the economic health of the province," says Emily 
Eaton, a professor at the University of Regina who has studied the 
relationship between the oil industry and the government. Eaton is a 
member of the Corporate Mapping Project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A shift in 2012 - from 
the Ministry of Energy and Resources to a new Ministry of the Economy 
tasked with regulating natural resource extraction and promoting 
economic development - changed the ministry's role from watchdog to 
partner, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're thinking about 
returns on investment ... The industry should really be regulated by 
those that have the interests of the environment first."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ministry field staff raised this concern at a meeting on July 1, 2015, between government and industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The role of the 
regulator needs to be adjusted," the meeting's minutes read. "The 
regulators are acting as consultants in some situations. The role of the
 regulator is to enforce the rules and if the rules are clear and if 
enforcement is consistent and clear then, 'cultural' changes can be 
made."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its statement, the ministry rejects criticisms of conflict of interest or lax enforcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Within the Ministry of 
the Economy, the petroleum and natural gas division carries out industry
 regulation," wrote the department's spokeswoman, Deb Young. "It is not 
involved in investment attraction, royalty and tax assessment and land 
sales. It is solely focused on well, facility and <b>pipeline</b> regulation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That regulation has not included fines or prosecutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry has not 
issued a single fine against any industry company "for well over a 
decade," Doug MacKnight, assistant deputy minister responsible for 
petroleum and natural gas, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Generally, we don't have
 to resort to that," he said. "It's usually just a notice to the 
operator to bring themselves into compliance."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prosecutions have also 
not been part of the ministry's enforcement practices because 
non-compliance was dealt with "through other enforcement actions," reads
 the ministry's statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other enforcement actions
 include increased inspections and staff, high-tech equipment for 
detecting emissions and a $69-million inspection reporting database 
(which can't be accessed by the public).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, complaints of illness from residents and workers continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I will sometimes get 
faint, like I will fall over and I have to find a seat quickly," says 
Lori Erhardt, a United Church minister and musician living near Oxbow 
who believes her chronic illness is related to&nbsp;emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I have had a variety of 
diagnoses, most of them end with "i-t-i-s," which means inflammation ...
 If something gets inflamed, if it's blood vesicles, you feel it through
 your body."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the five years' 
worth of documents obtained by this investigation is an April 2012 
PowerPoint presentation to CAPP members by the director of the 
province's petroleum and natural gas division. It includes a map of 
southeastern Saskatchewan showing a bloom of red and orange circles, 
labelled "critical sour gas locations."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sources say ministry 
staff pushed to make the data public but senior government officials 
said "there's no goddamn way that is going to be released," according to
 the former ministry source.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's an institutional
 reluctance to make this information public," he said. "The public 
should be able to see all the information that legislators have 
identified as public information such as sour gas and inspection 
reports."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry statement 
says the map was never approved for release because some data was out of
 date, not comprehensive and "could provide the public and industry with
 a false understanding of risk associated with a particular well or 
facility."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the Galloway 
incident, the ministry inspected 11 oil and gas facilities. All failed 
"with serious infractions," including releasing H2S at lethal levels 
"that may be exceeding 150,000 (parts per million)," Brad Herald, CAPP's
 Saskatchewan operations manager, wrote to the board of governors in 
December 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those levels are 150 times the amount that could cause instant death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the causes: "It is 
believed that inadequate training on the installation and operation of 
equipment is ... contributing to the air quality issues."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPP's Abel said in an interview the "unsafe" facilities responsible for those breaches should not have been operating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They should have been 
shut down," he said. "When you follow the rules, processing and 
production of sour gas is absolutely safe. If you don't follow the 
rules, it can pose a health risk. So ultimately, those operators at 
those facilities were responsible."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither CAPP nor its industry partners made the health risks public. And no ministry fines or prosecutions followed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Internally, CAPP quickly mobilized to develop a public relations and damage control plan:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are growing public
 concerns regarding the air quality issues in southeast Saskatchewan," 
Herald wrote, noting a petition and a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Ministry fields one 
to two public complaints concerning odours per week and the issue is 
garnering increasing political attention . . . This has the potential to
 become a broader industry reputation/<b>social license</b> concern and 
warrants immediate attention by operators in the region . . . 
Communications is preparing key messages in the event that there is 
media profile."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPP received a warning 
the next month after consulting a scientist with expertise on managing 
toxic substances, internal emails show. The scientist expressed 
disappointment noting that H2S failures were "so easy to avoid."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientist urged the 
industry lobby group to develop and implement a new code of practice to 
control dangerous emissions and get ahead of the problem by publicly 
denouncing unacceptable practices. The scientist also recommended that 
the industry group pressure the province to step up inspections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry, in meetings with industry, proposed similar reforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter sent in March
 2013 then-energy minister Tim McMillan - now president and CEO of CAPP -
 warned companies to meet "compliance obligations" or face "escalated 
enforcement, penalty and/or prosecution."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ministry and industry met
 four times between 2012 and 2014 to plot strategy, including emergency 
planning zones, a public communications document, a code of practice and
 a licensing regime for high-risk, single-well batteries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those plans were never adopted, a ministry statement confirms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Instead, the Ministry 
chose to take a risk-based approach to managing the sour gas issue that 
included increased field inspections and improved data collection." 
Eighteen wells that had been venting sour gas were ordered to be 
"shut-in" in 2012/2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 2013 to the summer 
of 2014, the ministry began implementing "an aggressive inspection and 
enforcement schedule to reduce sour gas emission" that included 
suspension orders against 30 facilities owing to "H2S management 
issues," the statement reads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During that effort, H2S would claim its most high-profile victim in Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Bunz, a salesman 
for Nalco Champion, died on May 22, 2014, while taking samples in a shed
 located in a provincial park between Carlyle and Kipling. A valve on 
the tank broke and oil, water and H2S spewed into his face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An incident report submitted by the tank's owner, <span class="companylink">Harvest Operations Corp</span>., states simply: "Spill occurred as a result of a failed valve."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nowhere does it mention Bunz's death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, his death is 
marked by a gravestone in a small cemetery near Wawota, where the father
 of two young daughters lived a few doors away from his parents, Dianne 
and Allan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The black, polished 
stone, with an image of Bunz wearing his Saskatchewan Roughriders jersey
 and hat, calls him "Bunzy" and reads: "In loving memory of Emma and 
Olivia's Daddy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He didn't really talk 
about those dangers," Dianne says. "We knew what it's like to work in 
the oil industry. My husband did for 20 years. We knew about H2S but I 
wasn't aware that he was going on site and doing the testing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The summer before he 
died, Allan drove his son to the Nalco office to quit. Michael's 
brother-in-law, who had worked there, had left and "things had been 
pretty tough," Michael said, marked by long days and heavy workload.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He was going to hand his
 company truck in, and his boss was there ... he talked (Michael) out of
 it," Allan says. "This company wanted him because he never ever phoned 
in sick or anything. He'd just go to work. And they offered him more 
money, so he stayed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nalco Champion is facing 
three charges under the province's occupational health and safety 
legislation for failing to provide Bunz with a respirator and to ensure 
he entered a dangerous situation with a second worker. A conviction 
would result in a fine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family says they were
 told by Nalco that the concentration of H2S in the fluids was estimated
 at 40,000 parts per million, more than enough to bring near-instant 
death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company sent reporters a written statement, declining further comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We remain deeply 
saddened by the loss of our colleague, Michael Bunz. The safety of our 
associates, customers and communities is vitally important, and we 
remain committed to our robust safety policies, protocols and training 
programs, which include those related to hydrogen sulfide," it reads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allan, who spent most of 
his working life in the oil industry, says he learned more about H2S 
protection when he worked on a pig farm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Every person had to wear
 an H2S monitor. And I'm talking about the pig industry," he says. "To 
me, they were protecting us ... more at this simple small hog operation 
in Saskatchewan than the oil industry ever did the entire time I was 
working out there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple reviewed the 
records documenting years of discussions between government and industry
 about public health risks and failed audits that were never made 
public. The couple called it "devastating."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I go to work every day 
and I drive down the highway and I talk to my son sitting beside me," 
says Allan. "I say to him "tough day there, son" and I tell him how I 
feel . . . I feel him sitting there beside me."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How often H2S incidents happen or happened in Saskatchewan remains a mystery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officially, ministry 
officials count one death and five "documented incidents where a member 
of the public was exposed to unsafe levels of sour gas near a well or 
facility site."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of them triggered a public statement by the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There was no need for public notification since the incident was quickly dealt with at the site," reads the ministry statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after dozens of 
interviews it is clear that H2S incidents involving residents are more 
common but go unreported or are not recorded properly. This is also true
 for workers in the oilfield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only months after Bunz died, Trina Hansen, an oilfield worker and part-time voice actress, was clearing a <b>pipeline</b> near Carlyle, Sask.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I could have died," she 
says. "It's almost like you could feel like a heavy air hit your face. 
It's a really weird feeling. Your first reaction is to inhale. When it 
hits your face, you breathe it in. It's the weirdest thing. You don't 
think to hold your breath. It happens so fast. I stumbled backwards. I 
was so shocked."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disoriented, Hansen got 
back in her truck and drove a couple of kilometres until she noticed she
 was losing her peripheral vision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There were white 
sparkles, iridescent, swirly, super-shiny and bright. I jumped out and 
started feeling nauseous and couldn't breathe very well. I was trying to
 catch my breath and dry heaving. My head started pounding."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hansen, suffering debilitating headaches, nausea and sickness, lost her voice for two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This happened three 
years ago and I still have a hard time catching my breath if I talk too 
fast. I'm very short of breath. I've never in my life felt like that. It
 was horrible."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her voice has changed for good - it is far deeper and lower than before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I do a cartoon on APTN 
network and they said my voice totally changed. It changed two octaves 
pretty much. It used to be high and now it cuts out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hansen never reported the incident, fearing she would lose her job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Nobody wants to say 
anything. We know it's bad and dangerous. But no one wants to raise a 
fuss. And being a woman and trying to prove yourself out there, I never 
claimed WCB (Workers Compensation Board). The economy went down and I 
have to pay off debt with my trucking money."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four months after Bunz's 
death, a secret ministry report listed 161 facilities "that may be in 
violation of (the ministry's) sour gas emission control."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The catch: "time and 
resources required to investigate and verify violations would take all 
available field officers over a year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2014, inspections of 
60 suspicious wells in 2014 turned up 36 - more than half - that were 
leaking so badly they had to be shut down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another audit found 11 
out of 12 facilities failed inspection "due to H2S venting" and found 29
 locations that are too close to facilities with high levels of H2S 
concentrations. Of the 1,352 active sour gas facilities, only 421 - 31 
per cent - had "proper emission control systems."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Almost every site had 
improper gas measurement," the report reads. "Discovered major 
contamination at two facilities as a result of spill which were not 
reported" to the ministry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry believes 
that the H2S issue is under control, saying air quality standards are 
being met and that inspections confirm that companies' sour gas 
management practices have improved. Today 27 full-time inspectors are 
responsible for the province's 126,000 wells and its estimated 118,000 
kilometres of pipelines and flowlines, operating with a budget of $3.9 
million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2016-17, ministry staff inspected 18,340 wells, facilities and pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, a team of 
researchers from Harvard and Northeastern Universities collected data in
 collaboration with this investigation using the same instruments 
employed by ministry inspectors to detect emissions invisible to the 
naked eye.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In my experience 
measuring oil and gas activities in Texas, what struck me was that about
 a third of the sites we looked at had what we believed to be fugitive 
emissions and the high density of pump jacks," says Lourdes Vera, a 
doctoral student in environmental sociology at <span class="companylink">Northeastern University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Michanowicz, a 
post-doctoral researcher at Harvard University's School of Public Health
 who led the survey in Saskatchewan, said about one in five of the 
facilities they visited showed black smoke rising from the flaring 
stacks of production facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If there is black smoke,
 there is particulate matter that if inhaled is certainly associated 
with human health effects," he said. "If sources of these air pollutants
 are constantly impacting individuals where they live, work and play, 
there is the worry that they are experiencing health effects."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In interviews with 
landowners and records in the government database, this investigation 
has found recent H2S accidents, including three people who say they were
 sickened by H2S clouds near their homes in the past year. One said they
 required hospitalization after a near-fatal incident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, more than 
four years after the H2S incident in Galloway's front yard, she and her 
husband were driving home when they encountered a plume of what she 
believes was H2S gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She fell ill and stayed home for three days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've had arrhythmias, really wicked headaches ... I've had bouts of nausea. I wake up at night and have heart palpitations."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Galloway wrote to public officials demanding a response.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were no 
consequences or fines as a result. And no official report of an incident
 anywhere near the Galloway property that day was filed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, says Galloway, is just the way it works in Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As a person living in 
the middle of the oilfield, you have no protection. The government 
doesn't care. Your MLA doesn't care. The oil companies don't care."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unprecedented Collaboration Behind the Project</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the past nine 
months, an unprecedented collaboration of more than 50 journalists and 
editors from three Canadian media outlets, four journalism schools and a
 think tank have worked to chronicle the hidden price of oil in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Collectively, reporters 
examined thousands of industry and government documents, analyzed 
terabytes of data and delved into dozens of freedom-of-information 
requests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The project started with
 the people," says Patti Sonntag, a managing editor in the New York 
Times' news services division, who launched the project with a grant 
from the Michener Awards Foundation. Following a tip from a colleague at
 the Corporate Mapping Project, she did some research and reporting in 
Saskatchewan last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working with the previous
 year's Michener winner, Toronto Star journalist Robert Cribb, Sonntag 
created a team of students at the Ryerson, Concordia and UBC journalism 
schools. <span class="companylink">Concordia University</span>'s Department of Journalism volunteered to act as host and headquarters for the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">University of Regina 
students reported on the ground locally, shot video and developed 
sources, while students at the other universities aggregated and 
analyzed data and interviewed experts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're pulling these four
 different schools from across the country and looking at it from all 
different aspects," says Janelle Blakley, a University of Regina student
 reporter whose team mapped spills data and met local farmers and 
residents. "This collaboration allowed us to really dig into it, where 
all schools were pulling apart different pieces of it and then coming 
back and putting it all together."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The significance of the 
data quickly drew intrigue. What emerged was a picture of a few 
dedicated regulators - and even some industry leaders - who tried to 
introduce greater accountability, but these efforts were ultimately 
overwhelmed by larger forces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You start to understand 
these figures really do play a huge role in dictating the direction of 
the Canadian economy and that plays out in the lives of everyday 
Canadians," says Lauren Kaljur, a graduate of UBC's master of journalism
 program who has been investigating the concentration of corporate power
 in Saskatchewan's oil and gas industry since the beginning of 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Matthew Gilmour, a recent journalism graduate at <span class="companylink">Concordia University</span>,
 after spending months populating spreadsheets and ledgers, "there's the
 human moment where you realize it's not just a pocketbook story. It's a
 human story. And people's lives are affected."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work continued past 
the end of the semester in April 2017, with students working alongside 
veteran reporters at the Star, the National Observer and Global News to 
shape the stories, seek comments from all sides and publish hundreds of 
pages of government and industry records, detailing concerns about 
potentially deadly gas emissions for the first time.&nbsp;- Steph

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Galloway, who trains oil workers to survive these same events, knew what to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She pulled the teen 
inside, grabbed an air monitor and held it out the door. The reading was
 off the dial — more than 100 parts per million — a level immediately 
dangerous to human health.</p>

 by the Toronto Star, the National Observer, Global News and journalism

Saskatchewan has strengthened its sour gas 
monitoring[https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2017/10/05/saskatchewan-has-strengthened-its-sour-gas-monitoring.html]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Documents obtained 
through freedom-of-information requests and from whistleblowers — 
internal correspondence, meeting minutes, presentations and inspection 
reports — disclose findings of failures in performance by oil and gas 
companies, including serious infractions, failed safety audits, daily 
H2S readings beyond provincial air quality standards and a death in 
2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet regulatory standards remain largely unchanged and H2S incidents and risks remain hidden from the public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The teen overcome in Galloway's yard eventually recovered but missed school for several days with nausea and headaches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">H2S can be an insidious killer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heavier than air, it tends to settle in ravines and valleys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just above the level 
Galloway's monitor detected — 100 parts per million — H2S causes 
olfactory paralysis, leaving a victim unable to detect the rotten-egg 
smell. Continued exposure at that level may cause death within 48 hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A person exposed to a 
highly concentrated plume of the gas — at 1,000 parts per million — may 
die rapidly from respiratory paralysis, or over the course of days, from
 an inflammatory reaction in the lungs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Victims effectively suffocate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government issued no 
public warning after Galloway reported the plume at her home because 
“there was no evidence that this was a widespread failure.” But inside 
government and industry offices, documents indicate the seriousness of 
H2S issues that led to years of meetings, audits and proposed regulatory
 reforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On April 7, 2014, 
government and industry officials deliberated about releasing data that 
showed H2S “hotspots” across southeastern Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Government may be 
accused of hiding information,” the notes read. “Public will want to 
know: 1. What are the areas? 2. How is it managed? 3. How is the 
government making sure it's managed?” one unnamed official told the 
meeting. “Are we creating a risk by not releasing this data 
immediately?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite acknowledging 
“significant” public health risks from H2S, at least some officials 
present expressed concern about “sensitivity in this data (because) 
there are residents living in these areas.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No release followed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three weeks later, 
government-proposed fines for emission breaches — up to $1 million in 
penalties — were rejected by two major industry groups. In a letter to 
the ministry dated April 29, 2014, the <span class="companylink">Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) </span>and Explorers and Producers Association of Canada (EPAC) called the proposed penalties “unsuitable.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A former ministry 
official, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of losing his 
current job in the industry, says “almost every amendment was being 
rejected.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EPAC officials declined comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terry Abel, CAPP's 
spokesperson, said the letter was intended to explain that, “in some 
cases, fines aren't appropriate at all … If there's an unsafe operation,
 it should be shut down. It shouldn't be operating. That's the best way 
to ensure the public safety is protected.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed fines were dropped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next month, Michael 
Bunz, a 38-year-old salesman supplying chemicals to oil and gas 
facilities, lay in a shack 80 kilometres from the Galloway house, dead 
after being exposed to H2S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The official incident 
report filed with the Ministry of the Economy, which regulates 
Saskatchewan's oilfields, makes no mention of Bunz's death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These regulators “are 
really thinking about the economic health of the province,” says Emily 
Eaton, a professor at the University of Regina who has studied the 
relationship between the oil industry and the government. Eaton is a 
member of the Corporate Mapping Project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A shift in 2012 — from 
the Ministry of Energy and Resources to a new Ministry of the Economy 
tasked with regulating natural resource extraction and promoting 
economic development — changed the ministry's role from watchdog to 
partner, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They're thinking about 
returns on investment … The industry should really be regulated by those
 that have the interests of the environment first.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ministry field staff raised this concern at a meeting on July 1, 2015, between government and industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The role of the 
regulator needs to be adjusted,” the meeting's minutes read. “The 
regulators are acting as consultants in some situations. The role of the
 regulator is to enforce the rules and if the rules are clear and if 
enforcement is consistent and clear then, 'cultural' changes can be 
made.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its statement, the ministry rejects criticisms of conflict of interest or lax enforcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Within the Ministry of 
the Economy, the petroleum and natural gas division carries out industry
 regulation,” wrote the department's spokeswoman, Deb Young. “It is not 
involved in investment attraction, royalty and tax assessment and land 
sales. It is solely focused on well, facility and <b>pipeline</b> regulation.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That regulation has not included fines or prosecutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry has not 
issued a single fine against any industry company “for well over a 
decade,” Doug MacKnight, assistant deputy minister responsible for 
petroleum and natural gas, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Generally, we don't have
 to resort to that,” he said. “It's usually just a notice to the 
operator to bring themselves into compliance.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prosecutions have also 
not been part of the ministry's enforcement practices because 
non-compliance was dealt with “through other enforcement actions,” reads
 the ministry's statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other enforcement actions
 include increased inspections and staff, high-tech equipment for 
detecting emissions and a $69-million inspection reporting database 
(which can't be accessed by the public).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, complaints of illness from residents and workers continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I will sometimes get 
faint, like I will fall over and I have to find a seat quickly,” says 
Lori Erhardt, a United Church minister and musician living near Oxbow 
who believes her chronic illness is related to emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I have had a variety of 
diagnoses, most of them end with “i-t-i-s,” which means inflammation … 
If something gets inflamed, if it's blood vesicles, you feel it through 
your body.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the five years' 
worth of documents obtained by this investigation is an April 2012 
PowerPoint presentation to CAPP members by the director of the 
province's petroleum and natural gas division. It includes a map of 
southeastern Saskatchewan showing a bloom of red and orange circles, 
labelled “critical sour gas locations.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sources say ministry 
staff pushed to make the data public but senior government officials 
said “there's no goddamn way that is going to be released,” according to
 the former ministry source.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's an institutional
 reluctance to make this information public,” he said. “The public 
should be able to see all the information that legislators have 
identified as public information such as sour gas and inspection 
reports.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry statement 
says the map was never approved for release because some data was out of
 date, not comprehensive and “could provide the public and industry with
 a false understanding of risk associated with a particular well or 
facility.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the Galloway 
incident, the ministry inspected 11 oil and gas facilities. All failed 
“with serious infractions,” including releasing H2S at lethal levels 
“that may be exceeding 150,000 (parts per million),” Brad Herald, CAPP's
 Saskatchewan operations manager, wrote to the board of governors in 
December 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those levels are 150 times the amount that could cause instant death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the causes: “It is 
believed that inadequate training on the installation and operation of 
equipment is … contributing to the air quality issues.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPP's Abel said in an interview the “unsafe” facilities responsible for those breaches should not have been operating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They should have been 
shut down,” he said. “When you follow the rules, processing and 
production of sour gas is absolutely safe. If you don't follow the 
rules, it can pose a health risk. So ultimately, those operators at 
those facilities were responsible.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither CAPP nor its industry partners made the health risks public. And no ministry fines or prosecutions followed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Internally, CAPP quickly mobilized to develop a public relations and damage control plan:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are growing public
 concerns regarding the air quality issues in southeast Saskatchewan,” 
Herald wrote, noting a petition and a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The Ministry fields one 
to two public complaints concerning odours per week and the issue is 
garnering increasing political attention . . . This has the potential to
 become a broader industry reputation/<b>social license</b> concern and 
warrants immediate attention by operators in the region . . . 
Communications is preparing key messages in the event that there is 
media profile.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPP received a warning 
the next month after consulting a scientist with expertise on managing 
toxic substances, internal emails show. The scientist expressed 
disappointment noting that H2S failures were “so easy to avoid.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientist urged the 
industry lobby group to develop and implement a new code of practice to 
control dangerous emissions and get ahead of the problem by publicly 
denouncing unacceptable practices. The scientist also recommended that 
the industry group pressure the province to step up inspections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry, in meetings with industry, proposed similar reforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter sent in March
 2013 then-energy minister Tim McMillan — now president and CEO of CAPP —
 warned companies to meet “compliance obligations” or face “escalated 
enforcement, penalty and/or prosecution.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ministry and industry met
 four times between 2012 and 2014 to plot strategy, including emergency 
planning zones, a public communications document, a code of practice and
 a licensing regime for high-risk, single-well batteries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those plans were never adopted, a ministry statement confirms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Instead, the Ministry 
chose to take a risk-based approach to managing the sour gas issue that 
included increased field inspections and improved data collection.” 
Eighteen wells that had been venting sour gas were ordered to be 
“shut-in” in 2012/2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 2013 to the summer 
of 2014, the ministry began implementing “an aggressive inspection and 
enforcement schedule to reduce sour gas emission” that included 
suspension orders against 30 facilities owing to “H2S management 
issues,” the statement reads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During that effort, H2S would claim its most high-profile victim in Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Bunz, a salesman 
for Nalco Champion, died on May 22, 2014, while taking samples in a shed
 located in a provincial park between Carlyle and Kipling. A valve on 
the tank broke and oil, water and H2S spewed into his face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An incident report submitted by the tank's owner, <span class="companylink">Harvest Operations Corp</span>., states simply: “Spill occurred as a result of a failed valve.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nowhere does it mention Bunz's death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, his death is 
marked by a gravestone in a small cemetery near Wawota, where the father
 of two young daughters lived a few doors away from his parents, Dianne 
and Allan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The black, polished 
stone, with an image of Bunz wearing his Saskatchewan Roughriders jersey
 and hat, calls him “Bunzy” and reads: “In loving memory of Emma and 
Olivia's Daddy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He didn't really talk 
about those dangers,” Dianne says. “We knew what it's like to work in 
the oil industry. My husband did for 20 years. We knew about H2S but I 
wasn't aware that he was going on site and doing the testing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The summer before he 
died, Allan drove his son to the Nalco office to quit. Michael's 
brother-in-law, who had worked there, had left and “things had been 
pretty tough,” Michael said, marked by long days and heavy workload.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He was going to hand his
 company truck in, and his boss was there … he talked (Michael) out of 
it,” Allan says. “This company wanted him because he never ever phoned 
in sick or anything. He'd just go to work. And they offered him more 
money, so he stayed.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nalco Champion is facing 
three charges under the province's occupational health and safety 
legislation for failing to provide Bunz with a respirator and to ensure 
he entered a dangerous situation with a second worker. A conviction 
would result in a fine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family says they were
 told by Nalco that the concentration of H2S in the fluids was estimated
 at 40,000 parts per million, more than enough to bring near-instant 
death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company sent reporters a written statement, declining further comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We remain deeply 
saddened by the loss of our colleague, Michael Bunz. The safety of our 
associates, customers and communities is vitally important, and we 
remain committed to our robust safety policies, protocols and training 
programs, which include those related to hydrogen sulfide,” it reads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allan, who spent most of 
his working life in the oil industry, says he learned more about H2S 
protection when he worked on a pig farm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Every person had to wear
 an H2S monitor. And I'm talking about the pig industry,” he says. “To 
me, they were protecting us … more at this simple small hog operation in
 Saskatchewan than the oil industry ever did the entire time I was 
working out there.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple reviewed the 
records documenting years of discussions between government and industry
 about public health risks and failed audits that were never made 
public. The couple called it “devastating.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I go to work every day 
and I drive down the highway and I talk to my son sitting beside me,” 
says Allan. “I say to him “tough day there, son” and I tell him how I 
feel . . . I feel him sitting there beside me.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How often H2S incidents happen or happened in Saskatchewan remains a mystery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officially, ministry 
officials count one death and five “documented incidents where a member 
of the public was exposed to unsafe levels of sour gas near a well or 
facility site.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of them triggered a public statement by the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There was no need for public notification since the incident was quickly dealt with at the site,” reads the ministry statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after dozens of 
interviews it is clear that H2S incidents involving residents are more 
common but go unreported or are not recorded properly. This is also true
 for workers in the oilfield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only months after Bunz died, Trina Hansen, an oilfield worker and part-time voice actress, was clearing a <b>pipeline</b> near Carlyle, Sask.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I could have died,” she 
says. “It's almost like you could feel like a heavy air hit your face. 
It's a really weird feeling. Your first reaction is to inhale. When it 
hits your face, you breathe it in. It's the weirdest thing. You don't 
think to hold your breath. It happens so fast. I stumbled backwards. I 
was so shocked.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disoriented, Hansen got 
back in her truck and drove a couple of kilometres until she noticed she
 was losing her peripheral vision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There were white 
sparkles, iridescent, swirly, super-shiny and bright. I jumped out and 
started feeling nauseous and couldn't breathe very well. I was trying to
 catch my breath and dry heaving. My head started pounding.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hansen, suffering debilitating headaches, nausea and sickness, lost her voice for two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This happened three 
years ago and I still have a hard time catching my breath if I talk too 
fast. I'm very short of breath. I've never in my life felt like that. It
 was horrible.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her voice has changed for good — it is far deeper and lower than before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I do a cartoon on <span class="companylink">APTN</span> network and they said my voice totally changed. It changed two octaves pretty much. It used to be high and now it cuts out.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hansen never reported the incident, fearing she would lose her job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Nobody wants to say 
anything. We know it's bad and dangerous. But no one wants to raise a 
fuss. And being a woman and trying to prove yourself out there, I never 
claimed WCB (Workers Compensation Board). The economy went down and I 
have to pay off debt with my trucking money.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four months after Bunz's 
death, a secret ministry report listed 161 facilities “that may be in 
violation of (the ministry's) sour gas emission control.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The catch: “time and 
resources required to investigate and verify violations would take all 
available field officers over a year.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2014, inspections of 
60 suspicious wells in 2014 turned up 36 — more than half — that were 
leaking so badly they had to be shut down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another audit found 11 
out of 12 facilities failed inspection “due to H2S venting” and found 29
 locations that are too close to facilities with high levels of H2S 
concentrations. Of the 1,352 active sour gas facilities, only 421 — 31 
per cent — had “proper emission control systems.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Almost every site had 
improper gas measurement,” the report reads. “Discovered major 
contamination at two facilities as a result of spill which were not 
reported” to the ministry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry believes 
that the H2S issue is under control, saying air quality standards are 
being met and that inspections confirm that companies' sour gas 
management practices have improved. Today 27 full-time inspectors are 
responsible for the province's 126,000 wells and its estimated 118,000 
kilometres of pipelines and flowlines, operating with a budget of $3.9 
million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2016-17, ministry staff inspected 18,340 wells, facilities and pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, a team of 
researchers from Harvard and Northeastern Universities collected data in
 collaboration with this investigation using the same instruments 
employed by ministry inspectors to detect emissions invisible to the 
naked eye.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In my experience 
measuring oil and gas activities in Texas, what struck me was that about
 a third of the sites we looked at had what we believed to be fugitive 
emissions and the high density of pump jacks,” says Lourdes Vera, a 
doctoral student in environmental sociology at <span class="companylink">Northeastern University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Michanowicz, a 
post-doctoral researcher at Harvard University's School of Public Health
 who led the survey in Saskatchewan, said about one in five of the 
facilities they visited showed black smoke rising from the flaring 
stacks of production facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If there is black smoke,
 there is particulate matter that if inhaled is certainly associated 
with human health effects,” he said. “If sources of these air pollutants
 are constantly impacting individuals where they live, work and play, 
there is the worry that they are experiencing health effects.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In interviews with 
landowners and records in the government database, this investigation 
has found recent H2S accidents, including three people who say they were
 sickened by H2S clouds near their homes in the past year. One said they
 required hospitalization after a near-fatal incident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, more than 
four years after the H2S incident in Galloway's front yard, she and her 
husband were driving home when they encountered a plume of what she 
believes was H2S gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She fell ill and stayed home for three days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I've had arrhythmias, really wicked headaches … I've had bouts of nausea. I wake up at night and have heart palpitations.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Galloway wrote to public officials demanding a response.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were no 
consequences or fines as a result. And no official report of an incident
 anywhere near the Galloway property that day was filed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, says Galloway, is just the way it works in Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As a person living in 
the middle of the oilfield, you have no protection. The government 
doesn't care. Your MLA doesn't care. The oil companies don't care.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unprecedented Collaboration Behind the Project</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the past nine 
months, an unprecedented collaboration of more than 50 journalists and 
editors from three Canadian media outlets, four journalism schools and a
 think tank have worked to chronicle the hidden price of oil in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Collectively, reporters 
examined thousands of industry and government documents, analyzed 
terabytes of data and delved into dozens of freedom-of-information 
requests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The project started with the people,” says Patti Sonntag, a managing editor in the <span class="companylink">New York Times</span>'
 news services division, who launched the project with a grant from the 
Michener Awards Foundation. Following a tip from a colleague at the 
Corporate Mapping Project, she did some research and reporting in 
Saskatchewan last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working with the previous
 year's Michener winner, Toronto Star journalist Robert Cribb, Sonntag 
created a team of students at the Ryerson, Concordia and UBC journalism 
schools. <span class="companylink">Concordia University</span>'s Department of Journalism volunteered to act as host and headquarters for the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">University of Regina 
students reported on the ground locally, shot video and developed 
sources, while students at the other universities aggregated and 
analyzed data and interviewed experts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're pulling these four
 different schools from across the country and looking at it from all 
different aspects,” says Janelle Blakley, a University of Regina student
 reporter whose team mapped spills data and met local farmers and 
residents. “This collaboration allowed us to really dig into it, where 
all schools were pulling apart different pieces of it and then coming 
back and putting it all together.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The significance of the 
data quickly drew intrigue. What emerged was a picture of a few 
dedicated regulators — and even some industry leaders — who tried to 
introduce greater accountability, but these efforts were ultimately 
overwhelmed by larger forces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You start to understand 
these figures really do play a huge role in dictating the direction of 
the Canadian economy and that plays out in the lives of everyday 
Canadians,” says Lauren Kaljur, a graduate of UBC's master of journalism
 program who has been investigating the concentration of corporate power
 in Saskatchewan's oil and gas industry since the beginning of 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Matthew Gilmour, a recent journalism graduate at <span class="companylink">Concordia University</span>,
 after spending months populating spreadsheets and ledgers, “there's the
 human moment where you realize it's not just a pocketbook story. It's a
 human story. And people's lives are affected.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work continued past 
the end of the semester in April 2017, with students working alongside 
veteran reporters at the Star, the National Observer and Global News to 
shape the stories, seek comments from all sides and publish hundreds of 
pages of government and industry records, detailing concerns about 
potentially deadly gas emissions for the first time. — Steph Wechsler/

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Alberta opts for a 
Conservative premier in 2019, the rest of Canada should brace itself for
 for an era of constitutional wrangling and inter-provincial conflict 
unseen since the 1970s.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All
 four potential leaders of the newly formed United Conservative Party - 
the product of a union between the province's Progressive Conservative 
and Wildrose parties, and the most likely threat to NDP premier Rachel 
Notley's reelection - have spent the campaign to date taking hard lines 
on trade, taxes and everything Ottawa. During the first debate between 
leadership candidates last week, a packed hall of revitalized provincial
 conservative die-hards cheered loudest when the candidates promised 
trade wars and constitutional legal battles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Responding to a question about the beleaguered Trans Mountain <b>Pipeline</b>,
 for example - which B.C.'s new NDP government has vowed to oppose - 
Calgary lawyer and would-be UCP leader Doug Schweitzer threatened to 
kick B.C. out of the New West Partnership Trade Agreement, and bellowed:
 "Our economy is stronger than B.C's. If they want to get into a trade 
war, bring it on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former MP and federal 
cabinet minister Jason Kenney, the race's front-runner, and former 
Wildrose leader Brian Jean have also proposed using an arcane <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>
 ruling to force a re-negotiation of the federal equalization program, 
which transfers money to "have-not" provinces with the intention of 
assuring equal levels of government services across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Alberta continues to 
suffer an oil-bust economic downturn, a Conservative premier would 
rankle much of the rest of Confederation on behalf of a province 
increasingly embittered by <b>pipeline</b> politics. It's the kind of 
muscular approach employed by premiers like Peter Lougheed and Ralph 
Klein, both of whom maintain a kind of mythical status in Alberta for 
their willingness to square off against Ottawa and the other provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's certainly an 
opportunity for a Conservative Albertan to flex his or her muscles. The 
environmental movement is intractably opposed to the development of 
Alberta's oil sands, opposition from other premiers to pipelines like 
Trans Mountain and Energy East threaten Alberta's ability to sell its 
oil in the U.S. and abroad. Meanwhile, under Justin Trudeau, the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>
 has expanded its mandate, stating that it will consider both upstream 
and downstream greenhouse gas emissions as part of the regulatory 
process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If B.C., Ontario and Quebec continue to oppose <b>pipeline</b>
 construction, and the federal government proves unwilling to use its 
powers to make the projects happen, there is little reason for Albertans
 to play nice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The change at the <span class="companylink">NEB</span> was sold as a bid to gain the kind of "<b>social license</b>"
 necessary to earn Alberta's oil industry the good will to expand; 
current NDP premier Rachel Notley has also invested in this more 
conciliatory approach, adopting a hard cap on greenhouse gas emissions 
in the oil sands and introducing a carbon tax. But from the Conservative
 point of view, the quest for <b>social license</b> has proved fruitless; if B.C., Ontario and Quebec continue to oppose <b>pipeline</b>
 construction, and the federal government proves unwilling to use its 
powers to make the projects happen, there is little reason for Albertans
 to play nice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that is where Kenney and Jean's constitutional threats come into play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In 1998, the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>
 made a decision in what is called the Quebec Succession reference in 
which it determined that if a province holds a referendum on a 
constitutional question and if it is adopted by a clear majority on a 
clear question, there is a binding constitutional obligation on the 
federal government to negotiate that issue with the relevant province," 
Kenney said after last week's debate. "If the federal government pursues
 a tax on our energy industry - the carbon tax - if it doesn't roll back
 the <span class="companylink">NEB</span>'s outrageous expansion of its 
mandate, and if it refuses to fundamentally change the equalization 
formula in 2019 I would be prepared to hold a referendum."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to several 
legal experts, this is no mere idle threat. But constitutional law is 
more complicated than soundbites allow, and the real question is whether
 triggering such a referendum would amount to anything more than a 
temporary legal headache for the federal government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To craft this proposal, 
Kenney relied on a paper published by retired University of Calgary 
political science professor and former Alberta cabinet minister Ted 
Morton, who said a referendum would likely force the federal government 
to negotiate on a constitutional issue in good faith. However, Morton 
concedes, a negotiation doesn't mean that that Ottawa would be forced to
 cede any of Alberta's demands; additionally, any actual changes to the 
constitution would require the support of seven provinces containing 50 
per cent of the population, as per the amending formula.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It would be a chance for
 those arguments to be put on the table, and who knows. Justin Trudeau 
might see opportunities for some reform," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the principle of 
equalization is enshrined in the constitution, the actual formula by 
which the transfer is calculated is a matter of federal legislation, and
 one that is up for review in 2019. The mere threat of a constitutional 
renegotiation might be enough to earn Alberta some concessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first debate: The 
four men vying to lead Alberta's new United Conservative Party( 
http://nationalpost.com/news/politics/four-candidates-vying-to-lead-new-alberta-party-to-face-off-in-first-debate[http://nationalpost.com/news/politics/four-candidates-vying-to-lead-new-alberta-party-to-face-off-in-first-debate]
 )</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Ivison: Trudeau's Liberals have kept all the <b>pipeline</b> promises they intended to keep( http://nationalpost.com/news/politics/john-ivison-trudeaus-liberals-have-kept-all-the-<b>pipeline</b>-promises-they-intended-to-keep[http://nationalpost.com/news/politics/john-ivison-trudeaus-liberals-have-kept-all-the-pipeline-promises-they-intended-to-keep]
 )</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if it did, however, 
University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe warns that there is no 
likely new equalization formula that would make any substantive 
improvements to the red ink on Alberta's balance sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if Alberta were able
 to exclude resource revenue from the equalization equation, "we have 
the highest level of fiscal capacity of any province," Tombe said. "I 
think there's lots of sensible changes that could be made, but Albertans
 shouldn't be under the illusion that it would improve our own fiscal 
situation. Changing the formula affects how equalization funds are 
allocated among have-not provinces, and we are not going to be a have 
not province."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short, all this 
bluster from Conservative candidates would likely amount to little more 
than political theatre. But what theatre it could be.</p>

<span class="companylink">Petrolympic Ltd</span>. ("Petrolympic" or the 
"Company") (TSX.V: PCQ, OTCQB: PCQRF) acknowledges that an important 
mile step has been accomplished by the Ministry of Energy and Natural 
Resources of Quebec who published, on Sept. 20, 2017, the draft 
regulations to govern oil and natural gas activities.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Petrolympic
 considers that the Quebec government is sending a strong message in 
releasing these regulations, confirming its will to strengthen the 
economic dynamism of the province in the absolute respect of the 
environment and of the local stakeholders, through the development of a 
robust oil and gas industry. These regulations will govern and clarify 
the exploration, production and storage licencing processes, the field 
activities on land and water environments (to the exclusion of the 
offshore marine environment), as well as <b>pipeline</b> constructions. 
In particular, they are intended to improve the synchronicity between 
the different ministries so as to homogenize the regulatory framework, 
to facilitate the coordination with the municipalities so as to account 
for the different uses of the land, and to improve the collaboration and
 the cooperation with the local stakeholders so as to achieve social 
acceptability faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The preparation of these 
regulations capitalizes on a series of in-depth reviews undertaken by 
the government of Quebec over the past few years and it reflects a very 
modern view of the industry best practices. The regulations aim at 
facilitating and accelerating the exploration and production of 
hydrocarbons in Quebec while enforcing very high industrial and 
professional standards for the safety of environment, persons and 
properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A period of forty-five 
days is allowed for comments and recommendations from the civil society,
 during which Petrolympic will carefully review the draft regulations 
and provide feed-backs to the government if appropriate. The government 
will then be able to implement the regulations, thus triggering the 
enactment of the Hydrocarbons Law. In parallel, the Ministry of 
Environment of Quebec is pursuing the review and update of its current 
regulation on water protection, a section of which providing 
complementary regulation to oil and natural gas industrial activities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Petrolympic CEO Mendel 
Ekstein commented: "As Petrolympic is moving forward to develop its 
diversified assets in Quebec, it is reassuring to see that we can grow 
and evolve in an environment defined by a set of modern and sensible 
laws and regulations. We are looking forward to collaborate with the 
government to put these regulations in practice in a very near future."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Management is confident 
that developing local hydrocarbon resources is a positive step for the 
Province, as it will balance Quebec's energy portfolio and strengthen 
its economy, while reducing the energy import deficit. Petrolympic is 
fully committed to securing and maintaining the <b>social license</b> 
and local support for its operations. Petrolympic seeks the orderly and 
responsible commercial development of its Quebec oil and gas exploration
 licenses, within the framework of the new Act and the new regulations.</p>

<span class="companylink">Enbridge</span> and <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>
 said the technology will complement, not replace, their existing suite 
of leak detection tools during the multiyear pilot as well as any 
potential expanded use of the sensors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It will require a significant investment by any <b>pipeline</b>
 company to do this, but you have to measure that in terms of the 
incremental benefit," said Ray Philipenko, Enbridge's manager of leak 
detection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're trying to improve 
our already strong safety record, so where is this going to take us? And
 we need to answer those questions. There has to be substantial benefit 
in order to justify cost."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Koles said Hifi's censors cost roughly $10 to $15 per metre in a new <b>pipeline</b>
 project where trenches have already been dug, calling the expense a 
rounding error in large projects. There is also an ongoing servicing fee
 for the company's software and technical support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fibre optic cables 
have been installed on a 32-kilometre stretch of Enbridge's Norlite 
project in northern Alberta, and will be tested on either end of <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s Keystone mainline, in Hardisty and in Houston after installation scheduled for next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The scope of this 
project is to take technology that we've tested in the lab ... and put 
it out in the real world and find what are the challenges," said Douglas
 Robertson, who leads a team that tests new leak detection systems for 
TransCanada. "The (company's) commercial group will decide about new <b>pipeline</b> construction."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Koles said <b>pipeline</b>
 companies have generally been reluctant to be the first to adopt new 
technologies, opting to wait until the tools or methods are proven 
before joining the bandwagon. Having large players on board for a pilot 
could give the small firm some leverage, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're not well known 
for adopting new innovation," Koles said, adding there are good reasons 
for this "very conservative, very safe" approach. "As a result, it 
becomes a little challenging on trying to sell innovation into something
 like a <b>pipeline</b> company."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hifi's expansion efforts 
are focused on new pipelines and retrofits of existing ones, especially 
in sensitive areas such as river crossings, spots where erosion is a 
concern and locations of previous spills.</p>

<span class="companylink">Inter <b>Pipeline</b> Ltd</span>.’s (IPL-T) stock has “significantly” underperformed this year and is now “attractively” valued, according to <span class="companylink">BMO</span>
 Nesbitt Burns analyst Ben Pham.Blaming the dip on concerns about its 
future growth and increased commodity price exposure alongside “weak” 
second-quarter results, he raised his rating for the Calgary-based 
company to “outperform” from “market perform” in a research note on the 
energy infrastructure industry.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“With
 NGL Processing cash flow poised to rebound in the second half of 2017 
following planned outages in Q2 and supported by higher frac spreads 
over the next year, the recent share price weakness provides for a great
 long-term investment opportunity, in our view,” said Mr. Pham. “Coupled
 with an attractive 24-per-cent upside to our unchanged target price of 
$27 including a 7-per-cent dividend yield (70-per-cent payout), we are 
upgrading our rating.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pham said the 
company’s NGL (natural gas liquids) processing appears set to grow going
 forward, with the acquisition of Williams Canada last year bolstering 
its processing footprint. “OPL is now benefitting from the same positive
 trends driving NGL levered names like KEY [<span class="companylink">Keyera Corp</span>.] and <span class="companylink">PPL</span> [<span class="companylink">Pembina <b>Pipeline</b> Corp</span>.],
 namely due to the increase in liquids-rich drilling and NGL 
production,” he said. “One opportunity is the proposed $3.1-billion PDH +
 PP [[propane dehydrogenation and polypropylene] &nbsp;project, where 
FID is expected H2/17 ($2 per share of potential upside), while another 
is the potential increase in frac spreads that would benefit existing 
operations. The Cochrane facility should also return to strong 
utilization following a planned outage in Q2. The unfortunate 
consequence of the NGL business is the increase in commodity exposure it
 comes with: to 18-per-cent year-to-date 2017 versus 10 per cent in 
2016. While the higher commodity exposure could continue to weigh on 
valuation, we think it will be contained and highly reliable cash flow 
in Oil Sands Pipes should offset. “As NGL processing adds to cash flow 
in the near term, opportunities related to intra-Alberta oil sands 
projects could arise in the medium term. Last year, IPL announced a new 
TOP contact for the Kirby North project; $125-million is expected to be 
invested at attractive returns. We believe this announcement illustrates
 that IPL still has considerable hidden value in the expansion potential
 of its oil sands/diluent pipelines. About $4-billion of potential 
investment has been identified and is not reflected in our model.”Mr. 
Pham maintained a price target of $27 for Inter <b>Pipeline</b> shares. The analyst consensus price target is $29.31, according to <span class="companylink">Thomson Reuters</span>
 data.“IPL shares are down 19 per cent versus a 3-per-cent decline for 
the group on a slowdown in dividend growth (we model for 4 per cent in 
2018) and higher commodity exposure,” he said. “IPL now trades at a 
discount compared to its historical premium: 2018 estimated enterprise 
value/EBITDA has compressed to 12.5 times from 14.0 times since the 
beginning of the year, while the 2018 estimated FCF [free cash flow] 
yield has risen to 9.5 per cent from 8 per cent. We believe the 
company's assets deserve a premium multiple given their long-life nature
 with creditworthy counterparties.”On the industry as a whole, Mr. Pham 
said he's shifting his preference to pipelines over utilities, noting: 
"Following a review of our Energy Infrastructure Top-Down Investment 
Framework, we have shifted our investment preference towards <b>pipeline</b>
 &amp; midstream equities over power &amp; utility within Canadian 
Energy Infrastructure. Why? (1) Midstream has significantly 
underperformed utilities this year and the sector is now trading at an 
attractive 9-per-cent FCF yield vs. the historical five-year average of 
8%. In contrast, utility names are trading at a 7-per-cent FCF yield, 
which is generally in line with its five-year historical average. (2) <b>pipeline</b>
 stocks offer higher dividend growth; and (3) we believe the combination
 of rising bond yields and a range-bound oil price is more positive for <b>pipeline</b> than the utility portion of our infrastructure coverage."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pham also upgraded his rating for <span class="companylink">Keyera Corp</span>. (KEY-T) based on its “robust” growth <b>pipeline</b>
 and “attractive valuation.”“Given the downdraft in Canada's midstream 
sector lately, we are becoming more bullish on the stocks generally,” he
 said. “KEY is perhaps a riskier proposition than most due to its gas 
processing throughput risk and Marketing volatility. Having said that, 
the stock has gone nowhere over the last two years and now trades at a 
modest discount to the group vs. a historical premium. We think cash 
flow per share should accelerate next year and the 16-per-cent implied 
upside to our unchanged $42 target is attractive. Accordingly, we are 
upgrading the shares to Outperform from Market Perform.”Mr. Pham 
admitted he recently saw limited upside for Keyera shares due to a 
number of factors, including a drop in gas processing throughput, 
“heightened” counterparty risk, downside in market profit and midstream 
fee compressions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Those risks have mostly 
surfaced now and are more than reflected in the share price, in our 
opinion,” he said. “Marketing delivered $23-million EBITDA in Q2/17 
versus $60-90-million per quarter in 2015, gas processing throughput saw
 5-10-per-cent declines in 2015 and 2016, and frac fees have come under 
pressure due to the infrastructure over-build. As a result, the stock 
has gone nowhere over the last two years, while sector values have 
risen, with most midstream stocks up 15-20 per cent over that similar 
period. “Given that relative performance, the stock is trading at a 
discount on 2018 estimated FCF yield (9.2 per cent versus the <b>pipeline</b>/midstream
 average of 8.8 per cent). Historically, KEY garnered a premium to the 
group due to strong management, a conservative balance sheet, and a 
premium organic growth outlook. Robust Marketing profit during 2014-2015
 probably also drove valuations higher than they would normally go on 
infrastructure growth alone.”His target remains $42. Consensus is 
$44.27.=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Falco Resources Ltd</span>.’s (FPC-X) Horne 5 
project is “to be advanced to production or be attractive as a potential
 acquisition target given the rarity of large scale, long life, and low 
cost projects in safe jurisdictions,” according to Raymond James analyst
 Tara Hassan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initiating coverage of 
the stock with an “outperform” rating, Ms. Hassan said Horne 5, located 
in Rouyn-Noranda, Que., stands out from its development stage peers 
based on its potential scale in production as well as its low cost 
profile and extended mine life. Falco owns the entire stake in the 
project, previously mined by <span class="companylink">Noranda Mines Ltd</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The project’s proximity 
to a mining centre eliminates many of the challenges that can face a 
development project as Horne 5 is easily accessible, has power and water
 to site, proximity to equipment suppliers, and access to a highly 
skilled labour pool,” the analyst said. “With the project being located 
on a brownfield site and in an active industrial area, permitting risks 
are perceived to be low, particularly given that the bulk of the 
tailings will be placed underground as paste fill or at other past 
producing operations on its claims. We note that Falco will need to add a
 surface tailings facility for the material it does not return 
underground; however, it is in talks to acquire a brownfield site that 
it could expand for its needs. It is also in discussions to acquire 
surface rights in two areas that it will require for surface 
infrastructure. The areas that it is looking to acquire will necessitate
 relocation of a school and an administrative building. We expect these 
discussions to conclude in 4Q17.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added: “The PEA 
outlined average annual production of 236,000 ounces Au at AISC of $427 
(U.S.) per ounce (net of by-products) over a 12 year mine life. This 
pegs Horne 5 in the top 10 Canadian development projects (with a 
published study) on an annual production basis and in the bottom two on a
 cash cost basis. When evaluating development projects not held by a 
major or intermediate producer, Horne 5 ranks in the top 3 Canadian 
development projects on a production basis.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hassan also emphasized the advantages stemming from Falco’s experienced management team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“One of the biggest 
challenges facing many development stage companies is establishing the 
team with the right skillsets and experience to carry the project 
through to production,” she said. “When a project the scale of Horne 5 
is proposed, we view this to be a bigger challenge as there are 
generally limited people available with the relevant experience building
 a project of that scale. In the case of Falco however, we believe it is
 uniquely positioned as it already has this team in place. The 
management team and Board of Directors behind Falco include many of the 
major players involved in designing, permitting, constructing, and 
operating the Canadian Malartic mine, one of Canada’s largest gold 
mines. With relevant recent experience in the region and with a large 
scale, high capital cost project, we believe the Falco team is well 
positioned to advance Horne 5 to production. While building a mine of 
the proposed scale of Horne 5 introduces unique technical complexities, 
the Falco team has encountered many of the same challenges in building 
the Canadian Malartic mine and are thus well positioned to address these
 challenges at Horne 5 and ensure risks remain low during the 
construction and operating phases. The common elements between the 
projects include the financing of a large scale, high capital cost 
project and advancing the project through the permitting process in the 
same jurisdiction. Unlike at Canadian Malartic, however, the Horne 5 
project is situated in a heavily used industrial area and is on a 
brownfield site, which we believe will simplify the permitting and <b>social license</b> components of the project.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hassan set a price target for the stock of $2. The analyst consensus price target is $1.91, according to <span class="companylink">Thomson Reuters</span> data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois expects <span class="companylink">Tesla Inc</span>.
 (TSLA-Q) to post losses until 2020, a year longer than the consensus 
projection on the Street. He believes the company’s vertically 
integrated business model (from manufacturing to distribution and 
supercharging) cannot become profitable as quickly as his peers expect 
or valuation multiples imply. Mr. Houchois initiated coverage of the 
stock with an “underperform” rating and $280 (U.S.) price target, which 
implies 27-per-cent downside from Monday’s close. The average target is 
$333.78. "Given capital intensity, we don't think DCF can justify the 
current valuation, let alone upside," said Mr. Houchois. "We appreciate 
the growth upside from a brand whose reach goes well beyond auto markets
 and that valuing Tesla today assumes some form of 'steady-state' that 
is unlikely to happen anytime soon."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though RBC Dominion Securities analyst Gary Bisbee believes there's "some" value in <span class="companylink">Equifax Inc</span>.
 (EFX-N) for patient, risk-tolerant investors, he said there's no rush 
as financial estimates for the scandal-ridden company need to fall and 
negative news could stem from Congressional hearings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wake of a 
34-per-cent drop in share price following the Sept. 8 disclosure of a 
data breach, Mr. Bisbee said "uncertainty remains high" and pointed to 
three lingering questions for investors: "1) How will the underlying 
earnings power of <span class="companylink">Equifax</span> be impacted 
by the breach?; 2) What risk of market share losses to competitors 
exists as fallout from the breach continues?; 3) Is there risk of 
tightened regulations or new legislation that “changes the rules” for 
the credit bureaus and hurts their profitability or growth prospects?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bisbee reduced his 2018 revenue forecast for <span class="companylink">Equifax</span>
 by 3.1 per cent and his earnings per share expectation by 11 per cent 
(to $5.96 from $6.68). His GAAP EPS estimate fell 37 per cent to $3.55 
from $5.68 including direct breach-related costs and estimated insurance
 recoveries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Clearly we have made 
many assumptions that could prove to be wrong, though we believe that 
they are reasonable under the circumstances and given what we know,” he 
said. “On the negative front, it is possible that providing monitoring 
to consumers could cost far more than our $260-million forecast, 
depending on the number of consumers that sign up or the cost to provide
 the service. And, we have not assumed any regulatory fines or legal 
settlements or judgements, though both are possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“On the positive front, 
insurance coverage could be larger, and we may have been too punitive in
 assuming that there is no cost reduction to partially offset the Global
 Consumer revenue decline (we don’t assume this because the business 
will likely actually be staffing up to provide the free monitoring to 
the much larger number of consumers getting free monitoring). We also 
may be double counting somewhat by assuming no cost takeout in Global 
Consumer while assuming that the monitoring costs (including <span class="companylink">Equifax</span>’s own costs) are fully in the model in the breach-related line.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He maintained an 
“outperform” rating for the stock and dropped his target to $113 (U.S.) 
from $154. The analyst average is $124, according to Bloomberg</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have been conditioned to recommend buying <span class="companylink">Equifax</span>
 on weakness (January-February 2016, October-November 2016), and that 
may well be the right approach here,” the analyst said. “However, there 
remains significant uncertainty into the costs and potential 
repercussions of the breach, and <span class="companylink">Equifax</span>
 will likely suffer in the court of public opinion in the short term. We
 also see little to be excited about in the near-term financial picture,
 as <span class="companylink">Equifax</span> faces USIS deceleration in 
H2/17 as mortgage refinancing volumes fall and it laps the US mortgage 
industry’s adoption of trended data last summer. Estimates need to fall 
(consensus 2018 adjusted EPS is 8 per cent above our new $5.96 
estimate). Add in some ACA uncertainty, tough comps through Q1/18 and 
likely lingering uncertainty about the financial and operational impact 
of the breach, and we see few potential short-term catalysts to drive a 
rebound in the shares, especially heading into what will likely be a 
difficult Congressional hearing on Oct. 3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Despite this challenging
 near-term outlook, we retain our Outperform rating, as we believe that 
current levels offer value for patient, risk-tolerant investors. We 
continue to believe in the quality of the management team and business 
model, and we believe that the franchise will work through this issue 
and continue to be a good (likely above average) compounder over time. 
However, in the short term we see no rush to step in to the stock, and 
prefer other recommended stocks where the risk side of risk-reward is 
more quantifiable.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citing its “attractive” real estate positioning, Credit Suisse analyst Christian Buss raised his rating for <span class="companylink">Gap Inc</span>. (GPS-N) to “neutral” from “underperform.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upgrade stems from 
Mr. Buss’s analysis of real estate for 32 softline vending and retail 
companies. He examined companies across eight “key criteria of retail 
health.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The biggest surprise in our analysis was <span class="companylink">The Gap Inc</span>.'s
 top 10 score,” he said. “GPS scored 57.1 per cent versus the group 
average of 50 per cent, and well above other mall-based specialty retail
 companies (LB [<span class="companylink">L Brands Inc</span>.] 50 per cent, ANF [<span class="companylink">Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co</span>.]
 50 per cent, and KORS [Michael Kors Holding Ltd.] 43.8 per cent). GPS 
pulled ahead by scoring higher in the mall exposure and mall quality 
categories.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Buss also said he was
 “encouraged” by the company’s recent announcement of a decision to 
close 200 low-quality Gap brand and <span class="companylink">Banana Republic</span> locations with the aim to focus on its Old Navy and Athleta chains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We believe the move to a
 healthier fleet and an increased focus on digital is prudent as sales 
continue to shift online,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Buss raised his 
fiscal 2017 comparable same-store sales growth, revenue and earnings per
 share projections to 1.1 per cent, $15.517-billion (U.S.) and $2.06, 
respectively, from 0.9 per cent, $15.512-billion and $2.02. His 2018 
estimates moved to 1.6 per cent $15.912-billion and $2.27 from 0.8 per 
cent, $15.765-billion, and $2.15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His target price for the stock increased to $30 from $23. The analyst average is $26.47.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Believing its merger with <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T Inc</span>. (T-N) is close to receiving regulatory approval, Credit Suisse analyst Omar Sheikh downgraded <span class="companylink">Time Warner Inc</span>. (TWX-N) to “neutral” from “outperform.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In the U.S., we believe 
it would be difficult for the DOJ to block the transaction on antitrust 
grounds given its vertical nature and the precedent from <span class="companylink">Comcast</span>'s
 acquisition of NBCU,” he said. “The main outstanding antitrust barrier 
is in Brazil, where the regulator (CADE) has highlighted competition 
concerns about the merger – however, we note that in the worst case T 
could divest <span class="companylink">Sky</span> Brasil to alleviate these concerns.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sheikh raised his 2017 and 2018 earnings per share projections to $6.09 and $6.63 from $5.95 and $6.62.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said: “We have confidence in <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span>'s
 future earnings growth given (1) as a pure-play content owner, it is 
structurally well-positioned as consumption of video content migrates 
online and new opportunities to monetize content emerge; (2) the 
roll-out of <span class="companylink">HBO</span> NOW should tap new demand for the product and could substantially boost 2020 <span class="companylink">HBO</span>
 EBITDA; (3) Turner screens well on our proprietary genre analysis, and 
we remain bullish on the company's ability to grow affiliate fees over 
the long term.”He maintained a price target of $107.50 (U.S.). Consensus
 is $105.85.“<span class="companylink">Time Warner</span>'s guidance of 
‘high single-digit’ growth in adjusted operating income in 2017 suggests
 the company is still benefiting from strong organic operating trends, 
notably in its core Turner cable networks division where the most recent
 affiliate renewal cycle continues to drive strong revenue growth 
despite softening subscriber trends,” the analyst said. “Absent a merger
 proposal, we argue TWX would likely trade in the 9.3-9.6 times 2018 
enterprise value/EBITDA range today, based on 8.5-9 times for Turner, 11
 times for <span class="companylink">HBO</span> and 9.5 times for <span class="companylink">Warner Bros</span>., suggesting fair value if <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span>
 were to walk away or the deal is blocked of $83-87. If the deal were to
 break, we believe the stock would likely trade above fair value given 
the quality and scarcity value of TWX's assets and their attractiveness 
to other potential merger partners.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One has to wonder. 
Pipelines are stalled. The Springbank dry dam faces powerful opposition.
 Now comes the inevitable fight against the Tsuu T'ina ring road, or 
major elements of it.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Governments have ceded so much power to regulatory bodies and the courts that almost any project can be stalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Politicians did this to avoid making decisions that infuriate vocal interest groups. They invoke the need for "<b>social license</b>." All that has done, across the land, is made the opposition more effective and determined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time after time, projects that matter to the vast majority just get stuck in the mud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ring road critics under the name YYC Cares will make their case to Alberta Environmental Appeals board next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, the board granted a stay of construction work in four wetland areas YYC Cares says are under threat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Mason, minister of 
Transportation and Infrastructure, is gung-ho to get this built. But 
Shannon Phillips, the zealous environment minister, will make the call 
after panel findings come out, who knows when.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She could order more delays. If she doesn't, YYC Cares could go to court. This sound familiar - as in, say, Springbank dry dam, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> <b>pipeline</b>, Energy East <b>pipeline</b>, etc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uniquely, the ring road has a firm and dangerous deadline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cars must be on the new road by May 2022. If they aren't, the land will revert to the Tsuu T'ina.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This would be a hard sell
 to the public. The road itself will cost $1.42 billion and the Nation 
was paid an extra $342 million for land and other considerations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obviously, missing that deadline would be an epic political and financial disaster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province isn't sugar-coating the risk of the YYC Cares challenge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are definitely facing
 the potential for delay of some elements of the ring road," says Adam 
Johnston, transportation department spokesman stationed in Calgary to 
deal with this project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"And that's specific to the 90th ave interchange where it will connect with the ring road."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">YYC Cares advocates have another issue, too - a planned bridge they see as a danger to the Weaselhead Flats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group wants it to span the entire valley, to a length of one kilometer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Johnston says that would be extremely expensive, and not as environmentally sound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another possible complication is the federal permit needed to open the sluices on a major river diversion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Johnston says these 
approvals are routinely awarded and he expects no trouble. But you can 
never count on the feds for alacrity, especially when vocal opposition 
is taking shape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will be a tense day in cabinet when the NDP thrashes out what to do about the YYC Cares challenge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This kind of Calgary 
fight goes back decades. Opposition to new river crossings was once so 
fierce that in 1995 city council passed the GoPlan, which prohibited any
 new crossings for 30 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many councils later, the GoPlan no longer has force. Stoney Trail, I notice on that scenic drive, has a river running under it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But YYC Cares continues the historic southwest opposition to any crossings or tampering with the Weaselhead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the Tsuu T'ina, as it
 happens, are doing much the same thing with their own opposition to the
 Springbank flood prevention project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not on First Nation 
territory, but the band raises the prospect of environmental damage and 
flooding. The Tsuu T'ina have called in the <span class="companylink">Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're determined to have the whole project moved to MacLean Creek.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospects for a major flood mitigation project within a decade of the 2013 flood look dimmer by the day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same patterns disrupt one project after another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> was approved by one B.C. 
government, and rejected by the next. Energy East proponents have 
suspended their application in the face of mid-game rule changes by the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>.</p>

 Angus is a good fit for Toronto's Pilot Tavern. The bar and the NDP 
leadership hopeful both have rich musical histories, so before he sits 
down for a bite, he has to bound over to say hi to the bartender, 
himself a member of a well-known band. Of course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Angus, an old rocker, is 
in the final days of his longest tour of all. It's the waning days of 
the party's leadership race, one that has been fought well below the 
national radar, but one that has major ramifications for Canadian 
politics.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For
 Angus to win, he must motivate the party's longtime members, many of 
whom he admits had let their memberships lapse, had drifted and were 
still bruised by a spirit-breaking 2015 campaign defeat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is believed to have most of that support, but they have to be enthusiastic enough to vote when balloting begins Sept. 18.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He must beat back an 
insurgent campaign from Ontario MPP Jagmeet Singh, the late campaign 
momentum of Quebec MP Guy Caron, who Tuesday picked up the endorsement 
of former party president Brian Topp, and the hard-left movement being 
built by Manitoba MP Niki Ashton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Angus is working to 
return the NDP to the days of Jack Layton, when members had a stake in 
decisions and felt valued, before the days when they were impersonally 
hit up for cash and told what the party's message was.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The party under Tom 
Mulcair had become rigid, hidebound, overly bureaucratic and afraid to 
take risks or make mistakes. It was the antithesis of bold. The Orange 
wave became the beige puddle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's been a tough road for Angus. He's had to campaign with the weight of his sister's death this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's had to endure 
sniping that he is too old, that politics, particularly leadership 
politics, are for the younger. Angus is 54, nine years older than Justin
 Trudeau, 16 years older than Conservative leader Andrew Scheer and 
Singh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Andrew Scheer acts a lot older than me,'' he laughs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I am a generation younger than (Bernie) Sanders or (Jeremy) Corbyn.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His ability to bring the 
party back in Quebec is rightly questioned, although he would likely 
make Caron a deputy leader and Quebec lieutenant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Singh says he has signed 
up 47,000 of the almost 124,000 eligible voters, including 30,000 across
 Ontario. Angus believes those numbers are bogus, part of a Singh bluff 
and bluster effort to win on the first ballot. But Singh has not backed 
down from his tally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Angus won't reveal his own membership numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Singh supporters 
will be seen as instant New Democrats and their commitment to the party 
beyond their candidate will be questioned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this is the bottom 
line in this leadership race. If Singh gets his people out to vote, 
Angus's efforts to build bridges to second or third ballot support may 
not matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As leader he would target the Liberal government for walking away from promises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He lists a "cynical" walk
 away from electoral reform. Not so much the policy, but more a prime 
minister blatantly breaking his word.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Indigenous 
reconciliation, he says Trudeau has been all talk and symbols. Angus is 
rightly appalled at the sight of Liberal ministers going to court to 
fight a <span class="companylink">Canadian Human Rights Tribunal</span> decision aimed at helping Indigenous children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He sees an Indigenous 
justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, fighting residential school 
survivors in court. He sees a brutally inefficient Indigenous Affairs 
bureaucracy that can't deliver services while children die and continues
 to try to erase Indigenous identity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He would create an 
independent child's ombudsman who could act so kids aren't dying because
 somebody's request for help is sitting on a desk somewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He believes the Liberal 
government has also failed on the environment after its grand promises 
at the Paris environmental summit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He would legislate the limits on greenhouse gas emissions, but remains somewhat vague on the West Coast Kinder Morgan <b>pipeline</b> which has pitted the Alberta NDP government of Rachel Notley against the British Columbia NDP government of John Horgan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says he is concerned about the safety of the <b>pipeline</b> expansion and he does not believe it has garnered the "<b>social license</b>" needed for the project but he wants to move beyond <b>pipeline</b> debates and talk about a new energy industry in this country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Angus has the chops for 
the job and could reinvigorate the party from the bottom up. But only if
 the party looks away from the flash of the Singh insurgency.</p>

<span class="companylink">Desjardins Group</span> promises a decision this month on whether to turn a brief moratorium on loans to <b>pipeline</b> projects into a permanent boycott.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a precedent-setting 
move from North America's largest credit union, which announced the 
moratorium in July, yet to date, the oil patch and Bay Street have been 
largely indifferent to Desjardin's debate over the pros and cons of 
pipes.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary-based
 energy-industry groups initially took shots at Desjardins's decision to
 bow to pressure from environmentalists, but quickly let the issue go 
quiet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In finance circles, 
executives at rival banks were either dismissive – one sarcastically 
asked “When did Desjardins start lending to pipelines?" – or sadly 
realistic, pointing out that the alternative to pipelines is shipping 
crude oil by rail through la belle province, and we learned how badly 
that can go wrong in Lac-Mégantic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The business community ignores the emotionally charged <b>pipeline</b>
 debate within Desjardins at its peril. A decision at the credit union, 
which speaks for seven million members and clients, doesn't dry up cash 
for energy megaprojects, but it would have enormous symbolic value in 
Quebec, and would likely serve as a call to action across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many clients, there's
 a deep relationship to a credit union that's not often found in 
customer ties to a bank or other financial institution. This is 
especially true for many patrons of Desjardins, which has a 117year 
history and branches in a great many villages and towns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the credit union's 
social role is not always well appreciated from outside the province, 
Desjardins speaks for a significant slice of the Quebec population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Desjardins is wrestling 
with a decision on energy transportation that's baffling to most folks 
in financial and engineering circles: This crowd just doesn't get 
opposition to pipelines. Most members of the business community see 
utilities as well-regulated companies filled with clever, if slightly 
boring engineers who move oil and gas with admirable reliability 
(contrast relatively rare <b>pipeline</b> leaks to how often the cellphone network drops calls).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there's a significant
 portion of the population that draws a straight line from global 
warming and starving polar bears to energy megaprojects. These clients 
have already pushed European banks such as <span class="companylink">ING Group</span>
 into halting loans to pipelines. Environmental and First Nations groups
 are becoming increasingly strident in protest at North American 
financial institutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Utilities build and operate pipelines with a <b>social license</b>,
 an ephemeral but important concept that implies people have to be 
comfortable with the way a company does business if that company is 
going to keep doing business. If Desjardins, its seven million clients 
and 47,000 employees decide the institution is no longer lending to 
pipelines, there's a strong argument that the projects have lost their 
social licence in Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a minimum, a permanent Desjardins ban on <b>pipeline</b> lending would be a huge setback for the planned $16-billion Energy East <b>pipeline</b>,
 which passes virtually every major population centre in Quebec as it 
carries crude from Alberta and Saskatchewan to three refineries and a 
marine terminal on the east coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s Energy East project 
already faces wellorganized opposition from the likes of 80 mayors in 
the Montreal area and a host of environmental groups. The federal 
Liberals have remained supportive. Approval becomes even more unlikely 
if one of province's largest financial institutions comes out against 
financing pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Desjardins' <b>pipeline</b>
 policy will also guide the thinking at credit unions in jurisdictions 
such as British Columbia, where a newly installed NDP government is 
already catering to its political base by moving to reverse the previous
 regime's decisions on energy projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are better ways for
 a financial institution to help shape Canada's energy future than the 
radical approach under consideration at Desjardins, which would cut off 
funding to a capital-intensive sector that is critical to the country's 
economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long before Desjardins 
announced its moratorium, wellinformed voices in banking were mapping 
out a path to a green future. In a keynote speech last year in Edmonton,
 Royal Bank of Canada CEO Dave McKay put forward a thoughtful case for 
using the wealth generated from fossil fuels to help fund the 
renewableenergy project that can power the economy going forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our ability in the 
decades ahead to finance innovation, to create the technologies that 
will power the 21st century and help transform the world to a cleaner 
economy, depends on our decisions today to get our natural resources to 
market," Mr. McKay said. RBC's CEO noted Canada hasn't built a major <b>pipeline</b> since 2010, while the Americans have increased capacity by 17 per cent in the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actively engaging with 
energy companies and advocating for a future that's less reliant on 
fossil fuels better fits with Desjardins' progressive mandate than 
simply cutting ties with <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> and the rest of utilities, which are among Canada's biggest corporations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A precedent-setting 
boycott would be a bad decision. The move would be largely symbolic – 
the Quebec credit union will never be a major lender to pipelines – yet 
it would signal that a major financial institution is no longer willing 
to do business with the oil patch, a key sector of the economy. If 
executives at Canada's largest financial institutions stop talking to 
leaders in the energy sector, this country is heading in the wrong 
direction.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At
 the Canadian Mining Symposium hosted by The Northern Miner at Canada 
House in London, U.K., in May, session moderator Bill Whitelaw, 
executive vice-president of Northern Miner parent company Glacier Media 
sat down with Kelvin Dushnisky, president of Barrick Gold (TSX: ABX; 
NYSE: ABX) to discuss the company’s restructuring into a leaner, more 
focused gold miner, and its new joint ventures at operations around the 
world. The following is an edited transcript of the conversation.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Bill Whitelaw: I’ll start with the notion that back in 1983, when Peter 
Munk formed the company, and within 25 years it was the world’s biggest 
gold producer. But growth brings with it all kinds of challenges in 
terms of projects that go over budget and top-of-market acquisitions. 
It’s part of the process of managing those growth pains that Barrick has
 instituted its Back to the Future strategy which is — what all good 
companies do — look back on the drivers of their founding and bringing 
that into the future. Maybe you could reflect on the success of that 
strategy?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kelvin Dushnisky: When Barrick started, our iconic founder Peter Munk was really</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">a visionary. The first 
acquisition he made — when Barrick was a small company — was Camflo 
Mines, and with Camflo came some real talent, including Bob Smith — 
another legend in mining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The way Peter and Bob 
structured the business was a very clear division of labour: Peter was 
responsible for financial aspects and strategy; Bob was responsible as 
an operator for overseeing the mines, making sure the right talent was 
in place, and making sure the operations ran well — which they did, and 
the model worked, I think very well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a long period of 
time, Barrick was the only company in the space with an A-rated balance 
sheet. It had strong financial discipline, projects were all built on 
time, on budget, and that model worked for a very long time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the reality is, if 
you go back several years ago, we lost our way in some senses. Like a 
lot of companies, we started chasing production — so number of ounces as
 opposed to quality of ounces. You mentioned an untimely acquisition, 
when our debt became too high. There were a lot of issues and challenges
 we had to face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I’d say intensively, over
 the last two and a half years, we have been restructuring the business.
 We have been using the Back to the Future analogy in restoring the 
discipline to the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a point in time, when we had 27 mines around the world, we used our regional business unit structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last while, 
we’ve been streamlining the portfolio, and we’ve shifted to a 
decentralized operating model. It’s been very effective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In essence, what that 
means is we have a much smaller head office, we removed the layer 
between the head office and the operating mines, we have empowered the 
GMs to really run the mines—they’re accountable and they have the 
authority to really run the mine as a business—and that’s proven to be a
 very effective approach and we’re seeing the results for that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We’ve reinstituted capital discipline in the business to a higher level than we had four or five years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time last 
year, we introduced the role of a Chief Investment Officer, whose 
responsibility is to ensure that our investments meet an internal hurdle
 rate, that we stay strict about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have been reshaping 
the business, trying to put it back to how it looked a number of years 
ago. Of course times change, and we’ve also been adjusting it for the 
21st century. We’re introducing a digital platform in terms of 
generating real-time data around which to make decisions. So we still 
have a lot of work to do, but we’re pleased with our progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BW: As part of that 
recalibrating of the company, you’ve gone to the decentralized model, 
and part of that is showing your leaders of the decentralized model what
 it’s like on the front lines. So you put your mining managers on the 
quarterly calls and let them speak directly. How is that working out in 
terms of how are they finding that, first as individuals, and how are 
the investors finding that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KD: You’re right, for probably almost a year now, we’ve had our GMs on the call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the reason for that 
is part of our commitment to greater transparency. There was a 
perception that Barrick was a little opaque, and people couldn’t really 
see into the company. There was a sense that either that was because we 
didn’t know our way or there was arrogance around the company in terms 
of not wanting to share information, which was never really the case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We’re giving the GMs the 
authority and accountability to run the mines, so when someone on the 
call — an analyst or an investor — has a question about a specific 
operation, they should hear from the person responsible and who’s 
running it. So that’s gone very well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that same context we’ve paired our GMs in a structure such that we’ve got a <span class="companylink">GM</span> running the mines and what’s called a Country Executive Director — in the old days you may’ve called it a Country Manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country executive 
director’s responsibility is to look after all of the matters outside of
 the fence, so to speak: license to operate; corporate social 
responsibility (CSR), communication, legal, and so on. The intent is to 
let the GMs focus on running the mines. They’re true partners — their 
compensation is linked — so if one doesn’t do well, the other doesn’t. 
And that formula has worked very well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BW: When you’re the 
biggest in the world, you also bear the burden of almost carrying the 
industry’s load when it comes to things like CSR and <b>social license</b> to operate. If you could reflect on Barrick’s philosophy on CSR and where we have advanced in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KD: This really is 
something that goes right back to the beginning, and it is part of the 
company’s culture and DNA, which started with Peter Munk and Bob Smith. 
When Peter brought Camflo into the company, I think Barrick was if not 
the first, certainly one of the first companies to institute a 
scholarship program. So any child of a Barrick employee anywhere in the 
world who wanted to attend any post-secondary education — college, 
university, what have you — is entitled to a scholarship. And that 
exists today, and I think there are more than 10,000 kids that have now 
been educated as a result of that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a starting point, 
and things expanded from there to NGO partnerships and we built — like 
other companies have — clinics and schools and so on. But we’ve always 
viewed CSR, License to Operate, as fundamental as production, costs, 
because if you don’t get that right, obviously, it’s very difficult to 
run the operations. We have the benefit of that history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There’s no question we’ve
 had missteps along the way. But when we have, we’ve tried our very best
 to correct them quickly, to learn from the mistakes, and then to not 
repeat them and move on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada, generally 
speaking, has a very good reputation. I know, when you travel around the
 world, one of the calling cards that we always use is the Canadian 
flag, and that’s one of the reasons. Canadian companies are known for 
being fair-minded, responsible, honest, transparent. And so from that 
perspective, we’re leading the way in many respects in terms of CSR. 
From Barrick’s perspective, again, individually, we’ve also elevated it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have a CSR advisory 
board that we put in place maybe three or four years ago, and these are 
kind of leading figures in the CSR space. None have mining experience, 
but they’re all very seasoned in their perspective areas, and they 
challenge us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s a tough board, in 
the sense that it’s not just friendly meetings, they really grill 
management, they kind of test our theories and what we’re doing a lot 
and that’s been very helpful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We also revamped what’s 
called a Corporate Social Responsibility Committee of the Board, led by 
one of our independent directors, Nancy Lockhart. It’s a very structured
 committee, which holds management to task and that’s important.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BW:What you think you’re doing in the CSR/<b>Social License</b>
 space is one thing, but what the communities where you operate think 
you’re doing is another. Maybe you could speak to Barrick’s engagement 
at a community level and some of the actual tangible benefits that the 
communities achieve as a result of that philosophy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KD: It starts with 
consultation and so, at all of our operations, if you go back 
historically, right back to projects like Alto Chicama in Peru, now 
called Lagunas Norte, from discovery to production, was just over three 
years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of that is because 
there was very extensive consultation locally which helped move that 
project along, and that’s an approach we’ve taken wherever we operate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Again, it’s one of these 
things you can never be complacent about because we can always improve —
 no question about that. But part of the shift we’ve made over the past 
while is increasing access to company information via the internet, for 
example. That’s something we find very strong response to, particularly 
in communities where we’re providing internet access and WiFi that 
didn’t exist prior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The way the world is now,
 particularly through social media, gone are the days when you could 
operate in isolation. You can never operate anywhere in isolation, and 
so it’s best to understand that up front and engage very actively, and 
it’s something we’ve been trying to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">GM</span>: You mentioned earlier the idea of 
chasing production and different types of production quality versus 
non-quality, but Barrick has a philosophy of actually focusing on cash 
flow versus production. Why is that important and what’s important at 
particular times?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KD: I wouldn’t want to 
say that we’re not focused on production — we are — but what we’re 
focused on is quality of production as opposed to number of ounces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like a lot of companies, 
we got on a treadmill a number of years ago where we forecast a 
production number — a number of ounces — and to try to achieve that 
meant you had to reduce the level of discipline that we’ve now put back 
into the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So we’ve been very much focused on margin, generating quality ounces over quantity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason we’ve been 
focused on cash flow is it’s an area that enforces certain discipline. 
We’ve been driving down our costs, which we’ve been very successful at 
over the last couple of years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We still have work to do, but that’s the rationale for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BW: You’re a Canadian 
company, but most of your operations are not in Canada. You’re still 
headquartered in Toronto, which [has a reputation] as being one of the 
golden cities for mining headquarters. What’s important about staying in
 Toronto, and staying Canadian?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KD: Our founder and 
chairman Peter Munk emigrated from Hungary to Canada, and he really 
attributes Canada — and Toronto in particular — being a mining centre, 
as the basis for his success and for Barrick’s success, and I think he’s
 right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto and Canada has 
everything we could look for: the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and 
Venture Exchange; all the large engineering companies; the banks; the 
law firms; and suppliers. There’s a centre of gravity around mining that
 exists in Toronto which is very supportive for the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You add on top of that 
supportive provincial governments, territorial governments, the 
associations like the Mining Association of Canada, the provincial 
associations, the <span class="companylink">Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There really is that kind
 of history and comfort with the mining business that doesn’t exist in a
 lot of places and that’s why Barrick will always be in Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BW: When you think about 
Barrick’s evolution and growth, you’ve been doing a lot of JVs and 
partnerships lately in Chile, in Argentina, in Saudi Arabia. Why is that
 a solid, preferred approach to growing a business?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KD: As part of the kind 
of reshaping of our business we started a few years ago, we also came to
 the conclusion that we don’t have to do everything ourselves, and 
particularly if we can enter into a strategic partnership where the 
partner brings something to the equation as opposed to just money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It hasn’t been unhelpful 
that some of the JVs we’ve entered into have helped us to de-lever the 
balance sheet which is very important. We’ve reduced our debt by about 
40% since 2015, and that was critical to us, but it’s more than that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You mentioned a couple of
 partnerships. One of the first was in 2015, with Zijin Mining from 
China at our Porgera operation, and that was our first Chinese 
partnership in terms of running a mine and that’s gone very well for us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then we entered into a partnership with <span class="companylink">Antofagasta Minerals</span> at the Zaldivar mine where we had the view that even though we think we ran Zaldivar quite well, our sense was that <span class="companylink">Antofagasta</span>
 could probably run it even better than we could. They know Chile very 
well, there are synergies, and we’re seeing the results of that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After that, we entered into a partnership with <span class="companylink">Ma’aden</span>
 in Saudi Arabia. Again they bring something different to the table, 
which was more of a cultural understanding, better ability to operate in
 that particular regulatory environment, where we initiated the 
commercial production at Jabal Sayid in the middle of last year, so 
that’s been going well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, we announced a partnership with <span class="companylink">Goldcorp</span>
 at Cerro Casale. We’re now 50/50 in Chile and we’re looking forward to 
the refreshed thinking that they may bring to try to move that project 
along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there’s 
Shandong, which we announced I guess a month ago now. It’s probably a 
transformational partnership for us, starting at our Veladero mine, 
where they will acquire 50%, and that transaction will close at the end 
of June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are three phases to
 it: one is the partnership in Veladero, where we look forward to 
working with them to generate more value from that asset; the second 
step is to look at Pascua Lama, and they have an interest in potentially
 developing Pascua Lama, provided the economics and everything works 
out. An advantage of Shandong is that they have very strong underground 
mining experience and the likelihood is that Pascua would be developed 
as an underground mine, starting in Argentina and moving into Chile. 
Then, the third aspect of that relationship is to look at the El Indio 
belt, which is a large expanse that we own between Chile and Argentina 
that hosts Veladero, Pascua Lama, and Alturas — another deposit we’ve 
announced recently — and so we’re really excited about that transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then we’re also 
excited about our partnership in Alaska with NovaGold at Donlin Gold. 
That’s a rare deposit: 40 million ounces, not constrained. It’s going 
through a permitting process now, and you don’t (often) find deposits 
like that in a jurisdiction like Alaska, so we’re also very excited 
about that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BW: One theme that has 
run through questions and answers here has been Barrick as a learning 
organization that’s helping your staff learn constantly, learning from 
investment partners and joint venture operations. But when you get to be
 the biggest, sometimes investors sometimes walk past you looking at 
other young prospects. If you had one final word for the audience here 
today, why does Barrick deserve a view from investors?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KD: I think of Barrick as
 kind of the young Barrick of the old days maybe coming back. The fact 
is we’ve spent the last two years doing a lot of heavy lifting to 
restructure the company, and put stability back in the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We’ve de-levered the balance sheet, our liquidity position is very strong, but importantly, we’ve got a <b>pipeline</b>
 of projects. Greenfield projects such as Alturas in the Andes, seven 
million ounces and growing; we’ve got Goldrush in Nevada at 11 million 
ounces, 10 grams and growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We’ve got a <b>pipeline</b>
 of organic projects we’re bringing on stream, Cortez Hills in Nevada, 
Turquoise Expansion, Lagunas Norte, then potentially the restart of 
Pascua Lama. And again, projects like Donlin Gold, which are very 
exciting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From a <b>pipeline</b> perspective, it’s very robust. Probably, we’d be the best in the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decentralized model 
we’ve put in place is operating well. We’re seeing the results of it, 
and a good testament is the results we saw last year: record cash flow 
for the company; US$1.5 billion in cash flow; our costs continue to come
 down, we’re managing that well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All the ingredients are 
in place to continue to grow the business well, we’re going to stay 
focused on capital discipline, we’re going to grow margins, and we’ve 
put the company in a position that Barrick is an investment to be 
considered in any gold price environment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts and investors 
are hoping for clarity on the fate of the project, which has been thrust
 into question since John Horgan's NDP in British Columbia wrestled 
power from the Liberals with the help of the Greens, who are staunchly 
opposed to the $7.4-billion development.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The

Wednesday, followed by a conference call with analysts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We expect KML-specific 
topics to be covered to include whether the Trans Mountain expansion 
project is on track for construction to begin in September 2017, as well
 as commentary on the NDP-led government in B.C.," said RBC analyst 
Robert Kwan in a report to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada</span> president Ian 
Anderson has said he is willing to meet with the provincial NDP and 
Greens but won't make further concessions on the project, setting the 
stage for a potential showdown between the energy giant and the

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada</span>
 completed its $1.75-billion initial public offering to raise funds for 
the Trans Mountain expansion in one of the biggest and most 
controversial IPOs in Canada in recent memory. Since then, its stock has
 lost ground from the initial offering of $17 per share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TD Securities analyst 
Linda Ezergailis wrote in a report that clarification on timing of the 
Trans Mountain project will likely boost the company's shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We believe that KML 
shares will re-rate upwards once investor confidence in the timing of 
bringing TMEP into service is bolstered by a clear line of sight to the 
conclusion of provincial political uncertainty and litigation associated
 with <b>social license</b> issues," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau approved the project to twin the Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b>
 between Edmonton and Burnaby, B.C., last fall and then-B.C. premier 
Christy Clark came to support it in January after five conditions she 
placed on it had been met.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, after Clark lost the election, Horgan has promised to use "every tool" available to stop the expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results from <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada</span> kick off second-quarter earnings in the oilpatch, with news about shipper commitments for <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s Keystone XL <b>pipeline</b> also expected to garner attention when the <b>pipeline</b> company reports its results on July 28.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher Canadian interest 
rates and uncertainty about where oil prices are headed have made for a 
cautious mood as major Calgary-based producers roll out their latest

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judith Dwarkin, chief

 stronger loonie, spelling bad news for oil companies who pay most of 
their costs in Canadian dollars and sell most of their products in U.S.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At the same time, oil 
prices are starting to move up so that to some extent may help to offset
 the impact of the higher dollar."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CIBC analyst Arthur

that also own refineries will be aided by better refining profit margins

 no plans to raise common equity. We see significant benefit in taking a
 position in advance of TMEP construction commencing (target date is 
September 2017). We believe KML shares will re-rate upwards, once 
investor confidence in the timing of bringing TMEP into service is 
bolstered by a clear line of sight to the conclusion of provincial 
political uncertainty and litigation associated with <b>social license</b> issues." Ms. Ezergailis set a share target of $26. Analysts on average target the shares at $22.67.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Cenovus Energy Inc</span>. (CVE-T, CVE-N) finds itself in a “particularly precarious position,” according to <span class="companylink">Desjardins Securities</span> analyst Justin Bouchard.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr.
 Bouchard said a “depleted margin of safety” has increased the risk 
surrounding the Calgary-based integrated oil company, amplified by $43 
(U.S.) per barrel WTI.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the analyst 
believes Tuesday’s investor day in Toronto did provide “incremental 
clarity” on its strategy moving forward, including the announcement that
 Brian Ferguson is poised to retire as chief executive officer and 
director at the end of October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“CVE refreshed its 
strategy, including an updated disposition target of $4–5-billion (which
 has been expanded to include Palliser and Weyburn) by year-end, the 
deferral of additional oil sands projects until it has sufficiently 
delevered, additions to its oil sands growth portfolio through land 
acquisitions and technology improvements,” said Mr. Bouchard. “It also 
noted the potential for medium-term infrastructure constraints as it 
works to execute its Deep Basin growth plan.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Mr. Bouchard referred to numerous headwinds faced by Cenovus, which he said put it “between a rock and a hard place.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The confluence of 
elevated net debt levels, low oil and gas prices, limited financial 
liquidity ($5.3-billion of debt maturing by year-end 2019), substantial 
increase in shares outstanding and impending divestment of CVE shares by
 <span class="companylink">ConocoPhillips</span> (adding technical 
pressure on the stock price), loss of market confidence in the story and
 attempt to execute a substantial divestment strategy in a buyer’s 
market (which increases the risk of fetching an underwhelming price for 
the assets) all contribute to the negative sentiment,” he said. “In our 
view, the only way out of this tailspin begins with the successful 
execution of its divestment strategy, followed closely by a rebound in 
commodity prices (to $55 U.S. per barrel plus WTI), which would in turn 
solve the company’s liquidity concerns. However, even then, we believe 
market confidence would only return following an extended period of 
successful execution of its Deep Basin strategy—which probably will not 
occur until after 2018 (at the earliest). Meanwhile, looking at the 
downside risks in the section that follows, we believe Cenovus is out of
 ‘easy levers’ to pull in the event that oil prices remain low for 
longer.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accordingly, Mr. Bouchard
 dropped his target price for Cenovus shares to $14 from $20 with an 
unchanged “buy” rating. The analyst consensus price target is $16.94, 
according to Bloomberg data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“From our perspective, 
the core of Cenovus — the FCCL and Narrows Lake assets — remains highly 
attractive owing to its best-in-class oil sands acreage, long-life and 
low-decline production base, and opportunities for further expansion at 
attractive capital efficiencies,” he said. “From a fundamental 
perspective, the stock is trading well below its intrinsic value (in our
 view), but that’s not the market focus right now. Instead, the market’s
 attention is set squarely on the fact that the company has depleted its
 margin of safety and muddied the waters through its purchase of the <span class="companylink">Conoco</span>
 Deep Basin assets. That, in turn, has greatly increased the number of 
headwinds and has dramatically amplified the risks surrounding the story
 — including elevated debt levels, reduced liquidity, its execution of a
 divestment strategy in a buyer’s market, questions surrounding its 
ability to deliver on the Deep Basin assets, the significant increase in
 shares outstanding and the loss of market confidence — each of which is
 magnified given the current commodity environment ($45 U.S. per barrel 
WTI) and simply cannot be ignored. As a result, while we are maintaining
 our Buy rating, we are cutting our target price.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, while acknowledging risks remain for investors due to the recent share price decline, <span class="companylink">Peters &amp; Co</span>. analyst Tyler Reardon said the current valuation is “attractive enough now to warrant buying the stock.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He upgraded Cenovus to “sector outperform” from “sector perform.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With the recent weak 
performance in Cenovus' stock price, it is becoming more evident that 
many of the challenges the company faces are reflected in the share 
price," the firm said. "We believe that the asset sales as outlined by 
the company will be completed with the anticipated proceeds sufficient 
to cover the bridge loan ($3.5-billion). Even with these dispositions, 
debt levels remain high as netbacks are very low at oil prices. The 
question of whether to buy the stock at this level really comes down to 
three things: (1) does it have sufficient longevity to allow an investor
 time for a commodity price recovery; (2) are the assets of high enough 
quality to matter in a $45 U.S. per barrel to $55/B pricing environment;
 and (3) is the potential upside in the share price attractive enough at
 this point to compensate for the downside risk. With asset sales to be 
completed in the coming months, this should allow the company time to 
withstand lower oil prices. Although the various metrics look challenged
 at strip prices and the equity is very sensitive to lower commodity 
prices, we believe that its assets are generally high quality and will 
compete with most other North American developments in this pricing 
range."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Reardon lowered his target to $13 from $14.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canaccord Genuity analyst Dennis Fong upgraded the company to "buy" from "hold" with a $15 target (unchanged).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the flip side, 
Macquarie analyst Brian Bagnell downgraded Cenovus to "underperform" 
from "neutral" with a $8 target (from $15).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TD Securities analyst Menno Hulshof said Cenovus’ road is “now defined, but appears long and winding.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He lowered his target to $15.50 from $18.50 with a “buy” rating (unchanged).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Although the role of the
 Deep Basin in its five-year strategic plan was well-articulated, its 
extended balance sheet remains front-and-center,” the analyst said. “To 
this end, CVE has increased its year-end divestiture target to 
$4-billion-$5-billion from $3.6-billion. Assets added to the list (i.e.,
 in addition to Pelican Lake and Suffield) include Weyburn and Palliser 
Block. It also flagged the potential for the sale of Deep Basin GORRs, 
oil sands GORRs, undeveloped oil sands leases, and infrastructure. 
However, with WTI oil prices continuing to slide (now $44 U.S. per 
barrel), it is unlikely that the market will give CVE the benefit of the
 doubt until it can get some of these transactions across the line. 
Selling Pelican Lake and Suffield in Q3 (per guidance) at reasonable 
metrics would be a step in the right direction, in our view.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CIBC World Markets analyst Arthur Grayger dropped his target to $13 from $18 with a "neutral" rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Cenovus' 2017 Investor 
Day covered a range of topics: including an update on expected 
disposition proceeds, capital allocation expectations once the balance 
sheet is in better shape, various sustainable improvements to the cost 
structure of the oil sands business and growth plans, commentary on the 
latest technological innovations, and a deep dive on the Deep Basin 
assets," he said. "Unfortunately, the market remains acutely focused on 
the near-term priorities for the company such as debt repayment and now 
management uncertainty, which overshadowed the key takeaways from the 
Investor Day presentation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial Alliance Securities analyst Dylan Steuart upgraded his rating for <span class="companylink">Home Capital Group Inc</span>.
 (HCG-T) in reaction to its agreement to sell a portfolio of commercial 
mortgage assets valued at approximately $1.2-billion to <span class="companylink">KingSett Capital</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The agreement is 
positive for two reasons,” he said. “First, the $1.16-billion of 
expected proceeds will enable HCG to pay down a significant portion of 
the $1.65-billion of outstanding balance on the 10-per-cent[<span class="companylink">Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan</span>]
 credit line. Second, the proceeds are estimated at 97 per cent of the 
total principal value ($1.2-billion). The estimated impact on earnings 
of $15-million from the divestiture is fairly modest given the very 
recent distressed situation at the firm.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Steuart said the 
troubled company’s liquidity situation is “stabilizing,” adding: “While 
earnings power remains negatively impacted by recent events, the funding
 situation has improved. Current liquidity of $1.14-billion has 
stabilized over the past month, with indications that asset run-off has 
been in line with the deposit outflow.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The biggest outstanding 
question is, what is the earnings power of the operations on an ongoing 
basis? At this stage, there are likely too many unknowns to get a solid 
handle on that question, but two things we know for sure: 1) the asset 
base is shrinking, and 2) margins are likely narrowing. Net interest 
margin as of Q1/17 was 2.44 per cent, up 6 basis points year over year, 
but marked a period of time not impacted by recent turmoil. This asset 
sale of high yield commercial mortgages (yielding 5.76 per cent as of 
Q1/17) will put downward pressure on margins. We estimate a 10 basis 
points negative impact to asset yields from this transaction in a 
vacuum. Recent increases in GIC rates (Oaken rates are up ~75 bps since 
the crisis began) are expected to be somewhat offset by increases in 
non-prime mortgage rates, but we still expect some compression in net 
interest margins. Combine narrowing margins with a shrinking loan book, 
and it is clear that the earnings power of the franchise has been 
negatively impacted over the medium term. We calculated core EPS of 
$1.03 in Q1/17 ($4.11 on an annualized basis). Stressing run-rate 
earnings assuming a shrinking balance sheet and narrowing margin 
indicate that the earnings impact of recent events is meaningful.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Steuart said HCG’s 
outlook has “brightened considerably” since his the latest update to his
 financial model for the company following the release of its 
first-quarter results on May 11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We assume a much slower 
reduction of the uninsured loan portfolio and more favourable terms on 
the line of credit starting in Q3/17,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He raised his full-year 
operating earnings per share projection to 75 cents from 42 cents, while
 his 2018 expectation is now 67 cents, rising from a 95-cent loss. He 
now projects HCG will have a tangible book value per share at $24.08 at 
the end of 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bumping his rating to 
“speculative buy” from “hold,” Mr. Steuart increased his target price 
for HCG shares to $19 from $10.50. Consensus is 14.07.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Raymond James analyst Brenna Phelan also hiked her target price for its shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Recently, <span class="companylink">Home Capital</span>
 has faced a number of negative events, culminating in a crisis of 
confidence whereby it lost $2.5-billion of deposit funding and saw its 
share price decline to close at a low of $5.85 per share,” she said. “We
 view recent developments, specifically settlement with the OSC for 
$30-million, mostly stabilizing (although still costly) deposit funding,
 a reconstituted Board of Directors, and a stated intent to focus on its
 core business as increasingly both encouraging and reflective of a more
 certain operating future for its non-prime mortgage lending business. 
Our estimates, which had previously assumed non-core asset dispositions 
at a discount of 5 per cent in 2Q, are revised to reflect the more 
favorable terms of this $1.2-billion portfolio sale. Overall, the price 
(see below) and the liquidity this sale provides, coupled with more 
stable funding, still-strong demand for non-prime loans and the removal 
of overhang from the OSC suits serve to brighten our outlook 
meaningfully.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the transaction, Ms.
 Phelan’s adjusted earnings per share projection for fiscal 2017 jumped 
to 43 cents from a loss of $1.18. Her 2018 estimate is now $2, up from 
43 cents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With an unchanged “market perform” rating, her target jumped to $17.50 from $10.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While we continue to 
believe a discount to book value is appropriate as current funding costs
 remain too costly to allow for profitable portfolio growth, we are 
increasing our multiple to reflect solid recent progress and much 
greater visibility,” she said. “We note that $17.50 equates to 9.0 times
 our 2018 EPS estimate, to which there may be upside if funding costs 
improve.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial Alliance Securities analyst Elias Foscolos called <span class="companylink">Enerflex Ltd</span>.'s (EFX-T) $140-million deal for Mesa Compression LLC a "beachhead" acquisition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the deal, announced
 Monday night, the analyst expects EFX’s total compression fleet to 
almost 600,000 horsepower, while expanding its geographic footprint 
south of the border. He projects the deal to be immediately accretive to
 earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We believe that EFX has 
been looking to grow both its compression rental and After Market 
Service ) business in the U.S. for many years,” said Mr. Foscolos. “The 
U.S. is the world’s largest gas producer, and to us it makes sense that 
EFX has made this acquisition to establish a ‘beachhead’ position in the
 United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“One key challenge that 
EFX has faced in growing its U.S. rental business has been that beyond 
E&amp;P companies owning compression assets, the U.S. market has a 
substantial amount of Master Limited Partnerships that dominate the 
compression rental space. These MLPs are similar to the old Corporate 
Income Trusts in Canada, in that they eliminated a layer of taxation. We
 speculate that EFX’s ability to quickly close the transaction with cash
 and credit facilities will be a strong selling feature for vendors. We 
view the Mesa acquisition as a ‘mini-AXIP’ transaction. In mid-2014, EFX
 made a transformative acquisition by acquiring the international 
compression assets of AXIP International for $430-million U.S., which 
included 285,000 <span class="companylink">HP</span> of compression (448
 units) in addition to some gas processing facilities. Over time, the 
Company was able to organically grow its compression fleet using the 
AXIP acquisition as a toe-hold and improve its <span class="companylink">AMS</span> revenue. As in the AXIP acquisition, we believe value will ultimately come from cross-selling opportunities.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keeping his “strong buy” rating for the stock, Mr. Foscolos bumped his target to $23.50 from $23. Consensus is $24.39.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While we believe the 
acquisition will be accretive to EBITDA over time, the impact at this 
point is not material enough in nature to move the needle on a multiple 
basis as we are basing our multiple based target valuation on the 
12-month period ending June 30, 2018, and we believe cross-selling 
opportunities in the short term may be limited,” he said. “We do see a 
longer-term benefit and as a result our DCF [discounted cash flow 
valuation has increased to $20.25 (previously $19.75).”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raymond James analyst 
Andrew Bradford bumped his target for Enerflex shares to $22 from 
$21.50.Mr. Bradford said: “We believe that Enerflex’s acquisition of 
Mesa Compression LLC represents attractive value for investors, 
especially given the stability of its cash flow. Mesa’s market focus is 
different than EFX’s traditional mid-stream orientation, which makes it 
difficult for us to comment on the acquisition’s strategic value with 
any confidence. That said, our expectation is that EFX will have little 
trouble growing Mesa’s core business, and perhaps will broaden the 
service offering to larger-scale mid-stream contract compression 
services as well. We continue to rate Enerflex Outperform."CIBC World 
Markets' Jon Morrison raised his target by 50 cents to $25 with an 
"outperformer" rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Morrison said: "We 
view the Mesa acquisition as a solid transaction that is on point with 
Enerflex's long-term corporate strategy and is being completed at what 
we consider as an attractive and logical purchase price. In addition, 
the assets are adjacent to three of the most active unconventional plays
 in the Lower 48, which positions the company to be able to: 1) realize a
 long tail of operating and financial contribution from the acquired 
fleet, which matches the long-life nature of the assets; and, 2) further
 expand Enerflex's presence in the U.S. contract compression business, 
which has been a long-term goal for the company."</p>

<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd</span>. (KML -T) possesses an “unprecedented transformational secured growth outlook” due to the Trans Mountain Expansion <b>Pipeline</b>, according to TD Securities analyst Linda Ezergailis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She initiated coverage of the energy infrastructure company with an “action list buy” rating.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citing its current valuation and a lack of a “meaningful” catalyst, Citi analyst Kate McShane downgraded <span class="companylink">Target Corp</span>.
 (TGT-N) to “neutral” from “buy.”“TGT was already under pressure given 
the soft [bricks and mortar] traffic trends, volatile guidance, and 
intensifying competition,” she said. “Plus, Signature, TGT’s key 
differentiator, has been decelerating (we estimated flat in Q1 versus 
low-single digit growth in previous quarters). With [<span class="companylink">Wal Mart Stores Inc</span>., WMT] enhancing its e-comm portfolio with <span class="companylink">Jet.com</span>
 and Bonobos over the past year through acquisitions that target 
millennials and AMZN’s sizable entry into fresh/organic food with <span class="companylink">Whole Foods Market</span>
 acquisition, TGT’s two main competitors have very quickly changed the 
game. This makes TGT’s revenue growth prospects through organic or 
acqusition growth tougher to achieve, absent any kind of game changing 
move.”Ms. McShane also believes <span class="companylink">Target</span>’s
 “big” catalysts have already been realized, adding: “CEO Brian Cornell 
(who started Aug 2014) has already improved the profile of the business 
significantly over the past couple years through: 1) Closing the 
underperforming Canadian TGT segment (Jan. 2015), 2) Selling the 
underperforming pharmacy business to CVS (June 2015), 3) Cutting costs 
by $2.0-billion, and 4) Improving capital allocation with greater-than 
$7.0-billion in share buybacks and the annual dividend per share payout 
grew greater-than 24 per cent.”The analyst lowered her target price for <span class="companylink">Target</span>
 shares to $56 (U.S.) from $63 “on flattish growth ahead combined with 
higher assumptions for capex.” Consensus is currently $59.59.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Though TGT’s 3-year 
multiple average is slightly above 14 times, we think the implied 
14-times multiple is still fairly pricey given the declining comp trends
 driven in part by decelerating Signature comps,” she said. “Plus, TGT’s
 prospects of reaccelerating comps are more uncertain compared with 
prior years as their closest competitors are aggressively increasing 
omnichannel capabilities through acquisitions (AMZN/WFM, 
WMT/Jet.com).“TGT has a challenging road ahead with likely need for 
greater investment spend which could put more down pressure on the 
stock. We could see potential upside if TGT benefits in the short term 
from dept. store (and others) door closures and better inventory 
management, but we think upside is limited given long term secular 
concerns.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis believes <span class="companylink">Adobe Systems Inc</span>. (ADBE-Q) is “doing just what exceptional companies do – execute consistently and well.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the San 
Jose-based software company second-quarter 2017 financial results that 
Mr. Davis deemed “solid across the board.” It reported total revenue for
 the period of $1.772-billion (U.S.), ahead of the analyst’s expectation
 by $42-million and a 27-per-cent increase year over year. It achieved 
operating margins, earnings per share and operating cash flow of 37.2 
per cent, $1.02, and $645-million, ahead of the analyst’s estimates by 
190 basis points, 8 cents, and $280-million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We believe <span class="companylink">Adobe</span>,
 through skillful acquisitions and on point development, has perhaps the
 widest competitive moat of any software firm we know,” said Mr. Davis. 
“We are not saying <span class="companylink">Adobe</span> has no 
competition, but the competitive set is simply not as intensely or 
directly overlapping as what other software firms face. When you combine
 a very compelling business with an investor expectations setting 
machine that literally is second to none, you get exactly what we have 
seen from ADBE shares: pretty consistent, better-than-market 
appreciation. Therefore, guess what, <span class="companylink">Adobe</span>
 did it again with another strong quarter, even adjusting for a bit of 
sandbagging guidance we got off of the last print; even so, the 
algorithms will rejoice and the longs might react favorably, both of 
which should propel ADBE shares higher. We call <span class="companylink">Adobe</span>
 one of our secular BUY ‘compounding’ stocks, which means that investors
 should rationally expect ADBE shares to roughly double within a 
five-year window.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the results, <span class="companylink">Adobe</span>
 also released third-quarter revenue guidance of $1.815-billion, beating
 Mr. Davis’s expectation by $22.5-million. Non-GAAP EPS is projected to 
be $1, which is four cents ahead of the analyst’s projection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In reaction to the results and guidance, Mr. Davis increased his target for <span class="companylink">Adobe</span> shares to $165 (U.S.) from $145. Consensus is $146.54.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He maintained a “buy” rating for the stock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, RBC Dominion 
Securities analyst Ross MacMillan also raised his financial projections 
for the company, but he did not touch his $157 target or “outperform” 
rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“ADBE continues to 
deliver on the promise of better operating leverage and a longer tail to
 the model transition, but still has pricing and capital allocation

<span class="companylink">Exchange Income Corp</span>. (EIF-T) is 
“designed to deliver safe dividend growth,” said Cormark Securities 
analyst David Tyerman.He initiated coverage of the Winnipeg-based 
company, which is focused on opportunities in aerospace and aviation 
services and equipment, and manufacturing, with a “buy” rating.“EIC has 
increased its dividend 12 times since its first dividend in June 2004, 
raising the dividend at a 5.8-per-cent annual rate (106 per cent total) 
to the current 17.5 cents per month rate (7.2-per-cent annual yield) and
 without a single decrease,” said Mr. Tyerman. “EIC has achieved this by
 building a diversified business portfolio focused on aviation, 
aerospace and manufacturing assets. Growth is driven through acquisition
 and organic sources. The Company focuses on businesses with low 
volatility and low cross-correlation. EIC also seeks to protect and grow
 the dividend by maintaining prudent financial leverage and payout 
ratios.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tyerman believes 
additional growth is “baked in,” expecting to see returns on recent 
“large organic invested capital deployment.”The analyst set a price 
target of $40 for the stock. Consensus is $44.70.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We recommend investors 
buyEIC shares to benefit from EIC’s attractive dividend yield and EPS 
and dividend growth potential,” he said. “EIC’s $2.10 annualized 
dividend (paid monthly) yields 7.2 per cent at the Company’s current 
share price. We estimate EIC will increase its dividend by an average of
 6.4 per cent per year and its EPS by 7.1 per cent per year from 2016 to
 2019. We also think the stock is undervalued. We believe the 
combination of good EPS growth, a moderate valuation multiple bump and 
solid and growing dividends should generate an attractive 44.6-per-cent 
investment return over the next year. We expect continued good 
investment upside beyond the next year from the same factors.”=====</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Very real concerns surface when the topic of the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b>
 expansion project comes up in conversation. The recent alliance formed 
in BC between the Green and NDP parties led to this explicit statement 
that they will: "immediately employ every tool available to the new 
government to stop the expansion of the Kinder Morgan <b>pipeline</b>, the seven-fold increase in tanker traffic on our coast, and the transportation of raw bitumen through our province."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Alberta is 
constitutionally entitled to the free and fair transport of our products
 throughout Canada. This is a fundamental part of being part of the 
confederation. Interprovincial pipelines are a federal responsibility 
and this project has the approval of the federal cabinet as well as the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>.
 As it stands now, BC can make it very difficult for the projects to go 
ahead and their decisions will have far reaching consequences for 
Albertans, and indeed for the whole country.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is unfortunate that our government believes they have the "<b>social license</b>"
 needed to get the pipelines approved because they imposed the crippling
 carbon tax on Albertans. This is political posturing intended to make 
Albertans think that the government somehow embodies the will of 
Canadians to move the project forward. Rex Murphy1 in the National Post 
called this idea: "a vapour of pure political duplicity" and Wildrose 
calls it: "political snake oil."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our economy is in 
shambles with 100,000 unemployed Albertans, 84,000 fulltime jobs lost 
last year, and international companies that have left the province. 
Instead of congratulating themselves on their <b>social license</b>, our
 government should be upholding our constitutional rights, the decisions
 of the NEB with respect to transporting our oil, championing our oil 
industry, and establishing strong working relationships with First 
Nations and stakeholders to ensure that there is confidence about the 
ability to move oil across the provinces to tidewater in an 
environmentally safe way for the benefit of all Canadians.</p>

 the Canadian Mining Symposium hosted by The Northern Miner at Canada 
House in London in early May, session moderator Greg Huffman, managing 
director and global head of mining sales at Canaccord Genuity, sat down 
with <span class="companylink">Barrick Gold</span> (TSX: ABX; NYSE: ABX) president Kelvin Dushnisky and <span class="companylink">Goldcorp</span>
 (TSX: G; NYSE: GG) CEO David Garofalo for an in-depth conversation on 
the strategies they use to guide both companies, plus a wider look at 
what the future holds for gold mining globally. The following is an 
edited transcript of the exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Question: Looking at some of <span class="companylink">Goldcorp</span>’s
 latest acquisitions such Gold Eagle, Virginia, Probe and Kaminak, is 
there now a premium on assets in safer jurisdictions, given the current 
political turmoil worldwide?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DAVID GAROFALO: It’s always been fundamental to <span class="companylink">Goldcorp</span>’s
 strategy to stay in low political-risk jurisdictions — generally, 
investment-grade countries with the notable exception of taking a bit 
more risk in investing in Argentina prior to the Macri regime. But that 
was a generational asset in Cerro Negro, and it’s been born out in the 
changing regime there and the Macri economic model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fundamental to our story 
is that we’re predominantly focused on the Americas and our own time 
zones. It makes it an eminently more manageable company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In my 27-year career I’ve
 worked with mining companies that are spread out across multiple 
jurisdictions on multiple continents, and it does introduce an element 
of risk and complexity to managing assets that makes it difficult to run
 the company, and certainly requires a risk premium associated with 
operating across too many jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the reasons <span class="companylink">Goldcorp</span> historically has gotten a reasonably good multiple is because of its very stringent geographical and geological focus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Barrick has operations
 in many more countries. How, in terms of the decentralization of the 
company, how have you been able to structure that to deal with the 
increased complexity of jurisdictions and the risks associated with 
that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KELVIN DUSHNISKY: In 
2016, 70% of our production was from our five core mines in the 
Americas: Goldstrike, Cortez, Pueblo Viejo where we’re partnered with <span class="companylink">Goldcorp</span>, Lagunas Norte and Veladero. And that represents about 50% of our reserves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside of that, in some 
of the other jurisdictions where we’re operating, we factor in 
political, technical and financial risk. Part of what we try to do in 
terms of managing risk, is we try to develop various layers, starting 
with local procurement and hiring practices, understanding local 
politics and influences on policy — be it local, provincial or state, or
 federal — and ensuring that we have strong relationships in that 
respect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We also look to 
jurisdictions where investment treaties could exist, ranging from 
Canada, which uses Foreign Investor Protection Agreements or even 
better, where we have free trade agreements with strong investor 
protection chapters. Those help us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We layer in various strategies to try to manage risk and generally speaking, it’s worked out well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What do Canadians bring to the table that may separate us a little from some of the other mining nations?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DG: We do have a long 
mining history, and more importantly we have a mining infrastructure 
that comes with that. And I mean people infrastructure, not just 
physical infrastructure, that we’re able to export, whether it’s 
banking, legal or financial expertise that we’ve developed over more 
than a century in mining in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accessing risk capital to
 work in the sector, predominantly within our own country but also we’ve
 been exporting that quite significantly over the last 30 years or so. 
Particularly as Latin America opened up as an investment, we were one of
 the first countries to rush in and develop, for example, the Chilean 
copper sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that brought a whole new level of expertise to Canada that I think is the envy of the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KD: I’d agree. The 
infrastructure exists, the services exist, the stock exchange and the 
predominance of publicly listed companies that trade on the Toronto 
Stock Exchange. And it’s more than that: it’s cultural — the familiarity
 with the space. Canada was mining before Canada was a country. Canada 
and mining, it’s a little bit like Italy and sports cars and the fashion
 industry. You don’t get that overnight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From our perspective, 
it’s equally important that we protect it. Maintaining the brand is 
important. There’s a strong element of support from the <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span>,
 and in our ability to wrap ourselves in the Canadian flag. We found 
that to be extremely effective as we operate abroad, in particular. It’s
 all part of the mix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generally speaking I 
think the country is perceived well. A recent example of that is other 
countries and jurisdictions adopting the Mining Association of Canada’s 
Towards Sustainable Mining framework for their own use. That’s very 
positive and reflects well on Canadian companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Goldcorp and Barrick 
have very strong records of community engagement across your operations.
 Are Canadians doing enough on the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
 front to maintain our <b>social license</b> as well as good reputation as responsible miners?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DG: When it comes to CSR,
 it’s all about water. And as an industry, we could certainly be a lot 
less water-intensive than we are. That’s a source of significant social 
conflict. It’s an impediment to getting both a <b>social license</b> to operate and getting projects permitted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s the biggest factor 
in the space. As an industry, we need to make significant technological 
advancements in terms of reducing our water consumption in order to 
enhance our ability to develop projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, by far, is the 
biggest impediment to developing projects. It causes untold conflict 
with surrounding communities. Even if you have the perception of 
utilizing scarce resources, even if it’s not true, against agricultural 
activity, you are not going to get the <b>social license</b> to operate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We’ve seen example of 
that time and again in our space. And given how difficult it is for us 
to replace reserves, if we don’t attack that issue of water use in our 
industry, it’s going to be very difficult for us to perpetuate our 
businesses in the long run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Recently Barrick and <span class="companylink">Goldcorp</span>
 partnered on the Cerro Casale-Caspiche assets which are obviously in a 
very water-sensitive area. Do you see some synergies by putting these 
projects together, from a permitting, water-usage and cost perspective?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KD: We certainly hope so,
 and that was the purpose of us coming together. We’re enthusiastic 
about the new partnership and think <span class="companylink">Goldcorp</span> will bring some fresh perspective, thinking and energy to that situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cerro Casale is 
interesting in that we have water rights that are important. These are 
water rights that relate to a particular aquifer — without getting into 
the technical details — and that’s something that is relatively rare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I agree with Dave that 
water could certainly be the industry’s Achilles heel if we don’t manage
 it carefully. Over the last year we have hired and put in place a 
vice-president for water, dealing with both near-term environmental 
issues and looking out over the longer term at policy and other issues 
that could affect us, both as a company and as an industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What about on the 
government-relations standpoint? Permitting is a big aspect of that, but
 with the rebound in commodity prices are you starting to see 
indications that governments may be seeking a bigger slice of the pie? 
And are there ways for industry to better insulate investors from this 
risk?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KD: Part of what we as a 
company and industry can improve on is to better communicate to host 
governments and locally the benefits that come from mining. For example,
 for 2016 alone, we spent around US$5.3 billion in various jurisdictions
 where we’re operating as taxes, royalties, wages, local procurement, 
etc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don’t think we’ve 
communicated well enough to governments the timelines associated with 
our investment. There’s a sense that as soon as you make the investment,
 you’re generating big returns, when the reality we all know is it takes
 a long time to pay back all our capital in this business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What about personnel risk? Where do you see the greatest skills shortages in the industry right now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DG: I think it’s trades. A
 lot of trades have skills that are transferable to an urban 
environment. If you’re trying to raise a family or, for that matter, 
start a family or a relationship, it’s much easier to do in an urban 
environment than it is if you’re a young person in a mining camp or an 
isolated part of the world where you might be mining. That’s a 
significant challenge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don’t think we’ve done a
 very good job — at least in Canada — of importing those skills that we 
require, because trade schools are not turning out enough people to meet
 our shortages, whether it’s mechanics or electricians and the like. 
These are skills that are easily transported into urban environments, so
 we have to pay a premium to get them, but there’s just not enough of 
them even if we’re paying the premium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KD: I agree with Dave, 
plus the traditional careers: engineers and geologists. We went through 
that period a decade or so ago when mining wasn’t the most attractive 
place, and kids weren’t going into the engineering and geology programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other area where the 
biggest or equal challenge is going to come is attracting younger people
 into our space. We need people who can write code and have other skills
 beyond the classical trades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We’ve done some survey work lately and if you ask kids who have recently graduated, would you rather go to <span class="companylink">Google</span> or <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> or Apple or Barrick, we’ve got a pretty high bar to get kids to come to a mining company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We held recently — and I 
didn’t even know what this thing was until I was told — a “hackathon” 
where younger people assembled in a room and they brainstormed around a 
maintenance problem and a geological issue. We had kids from all over 
the place with different backgrounds coming at these various problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of them interviewed 
at the very start and we asked him, “What do you think of the mining 
business?” And he said, “Who would go into it? It’s a dinosaur 
industry.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of the 
weekend, the response was actually very cool. They said there were a lot
 of areas where they could apply their talents and be innovative and 
creative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As an industry we have to
 be more attractive to young people and send that message. The reality 
is, I can’t think of another business that touches on every single 
aspect of commerce, from financing, marketing, engineering to 
communication. Pick a topic area, and we touch on it one way or another,
 but that’s not well understood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Are the schools doing enough right now to groom the next generation of mining leaders?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KD: The Canadian schools 
are doing their part. They’re responding to demand, so part of what we 
need to do as an industry is to be supportive of the Canadian schools. 
We’re doing our part, but probably not as systematic as we should and 
could, and that’s something we’ll be focusing on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In terms of succession, 
we have what we call “Barrick Academy” where we do more internally to 
groom the next generation of mining leaders, and that’s resonating well 
in the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We’re seeing an 
attraction of people to Barrick now. I’ll be honest with you, you go 
back three or four years ago and there was an outflow of talent from 
Barrick to our friends [grabs and shakes Garofalo jokingly]. We’re happy
 to see an inflow back, but we can’t get complacent — that’s the risk. 
We have to be vigilant and keep the space attractive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. The market over the 
past year has started to look at production-growth profiles again, 
compared to 12 months ago when they mostly looked at free cash flow. For
 companies of your size it becomes hard to fill that production <b>pipeline</b>
 because you need big, meaningful assets. What’s the next step in 
de-risking those large assets from a financial aspect, i.e. raising the 
capital to buy and build these mega-projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DG:First you have to make
 an investment case, and that’s probably the biggest impediment to 
raising capital — finding the investment opportunities that generate an 
adequate rate of return to attract the capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As an industry we are 
facing a reserve cliff. Over the last five years in the gold sector 
we’ve seen a one-third decline in our reserves. In case you think that’s
 because we’re using lower gold price assumptions, that’s actually not 
true — it probably accounts for 30% of that decline. Seventy percent is 
actually depletion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We haven’t been investing
 back in the ground, not only in terms of exploration, but also in terms
 of de-risking projects, bringing them though the <b>pipeline</b> and making that investment case to try to attract financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The capital is out there 
if you can demonstrate an adequate rate of return, but we haven’t 
de-risked large-scale projects sufficiently to replace what we’re 
depleting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you look at the 
production perspective, by our own admission, the industry will be 
shrinking production by 15% to 20% in the ensuing five years. And that’s
 because the declining reserves is the leading edge of that. Obviously 
production will decline as reserves decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So as an industry, we 
have to start to collaborate more. None of us should take on our 
shoulders individually the response of reversing that downward 
trajectory of reserves. We have to collaborate to bring meaningful 
projects forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And those projects are 
declining in grade. The average mining grade today of a gram a tonne is 
about half of what it was 15 years ago. So we have to do bulk tonnage, 
with bigger equipment, to deliver those economies of scale and make 
those lower grade deposits economic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But none of us need to take on that capital risk ourselves, nor the project risk and technical risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The model we’re pursuing 
with Teck at NuevaUnion and with Barrick at Maricunga is one we have to 
pursue going forward, to share the financial and technical risk with 
well-capitalized partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So we avoid the Sudburys,
 the Nevadas, and for that matter the Red Lakes of the world where we 
built duplicative infrastructure on the same deposits and massively 
destroyed capital. And that drove away investors from the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I’m encouraged by the 
fact that we have a new generation of CEOs in this space over the last 
four or five years that have a different mindset. They are taking that 
capital discipline and bringing it to bear within the sector, where 
traditionally that hasn’t been the case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Kelvin, you’ve 
partnered up on a number of assets over the last 18 months. Could you go
 through Barrick’s evaluative process for finding partners for various 
assets?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KD: The reality is we 
haven’t entered into a partnership yet where we don’t see a longer-term 
strategic fit. So it’s partly about capital, but not only about capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From our perspective — 
and I agree with everything David just said — we’re trying to de-risk 
projects to the extent we can, and build in stages whenever we can, 
instead of the “swing for the fences” model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A real-life example of 
that is, we’re dealing with our Goldrush project in Nevada. Goldrush has
 11 million ounces and growing, and when we first looked at the deposit,
 we did the classic “this is Nevada” approach and drew a 1 by 2 mile 
circle around it as a potential open pit and started thinking about how 
we could develop it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then we realized that 
could be interesting, but we’d prefer to develop Goldrush as a smaller, 
lower-capital underground mine. It’s quicker to bring it into 
production, and requires much less capital. In this case, there’s very 
little capital risk, as we’ll take advantage of the Cortez and 
Goldstrike facilities nearby. So it’s unique in that regard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to the extent that we
 can build in stages, and use cashflow to pay for subsequent stages, 
that how Goldstrike was built. It wouldn’t be a mine today if we had 
tried to build it all at once in the 1980s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In terms of partners, one example is we sold half of our Zaldivar copper mine to <span class="companylink">Antofagasta</span>
 because we had a view that, even though we thought we were running it 
well, they should probably be able to run it better than we could, given
 their synergies and their long history and understanding of operating 
in Chile. And that’s turned out to be the case. Just like if they had a 
single asset in Nevada, we should probably be able to run that mine 
better than they could.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We think <span class="companylink">Goldcorp</span> is going to bring a lot to the equation at Cerro Casale, and there are synergies with their other activities in Chile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In every instance, we’re 
looking for something strategic in the fit. And if we find that, then it
 makes sense for us to partner. And if not, we’re happy to run the asset
 on our own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. David, you talked 
about the decline in reserve grades globally. With a lot of the 
low-hanging fruit gone, will a lot of the new generation of mines come 
from new discoveries, or is it going to be a new look at old deposits?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DG:Probably a combination thereof, and I know that’s a bit of a cop-out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as we see 
technological advancement, and the next frontier for us is artificial 
intelligence and driverless vehicles within our mines that will drive 
down labour costs, which is a big component of our cost structures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That will allow us to relook at lower grade deposits that may not make the cut right now, to replace what we’re depleting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Barrick is making a 
big investment in new technology. Kelvin, what do you think could be the
 most game-changing or disruptive technology that will change our 
business?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KD: When we decentralized
 our business in recent years, what we found as we cleared away the 
middle layer between head office and the mines, was an increased flow of
 information between the two. We unclogged the artery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while we were in a 
position to make better decisions, what we were lacking was real-time 
data to make those decisions with. So part of our effort intensively 
over the last year has been digitization from the mines all the way to 
head office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s a process, and it’s 
going to take us a while to get there. But already we’re finding the 
ability to make decisions more quickly. They’re simple things like 
short-interval controls — how we move people around, both in the open 
pit and underground in a more efficient way than we ever did in the 
past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are small things that really add up, shift after shift, week after week, month after month. We’re seeing gains that way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond that, the use of 
autonomous vehicles, especially underground, is something that will be 
very important to us. More of our mines are likely to be underground as 
we move to the next generation, so it’s going to be in even more 
compelling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We’re trying to apply 
innovation throughout our business, from processing to better 
maintenance. We have a “code mine” which is kind of a mini-<span class="companylink">Google</span>
 campus where we have code writers working with our mine operators to 
develop apps that make their day more efficient and easier, and we’re 
already seeing results from that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it’s a combination of things, rather than a one “eureka!” breakthrough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. David, while at Agnico
 and Hudbay, you had a very effective strategy of actively investing in 
juniors with prospective discoveries and projects that you liked. Is 
grassroots exploration best left to the juniors, with seniors focusing 
on brownfields exploration near mines? Or is there a balance?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DG: I do think it 
requires a different mindset to do grassroots exploration, and it has a 
completely different risk profile and skill set. I think it is best left
 to the juniors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grassroots exploration is the highest-risk component of value creation within our industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Portfolio theory tells you that when you have risk, diversify it. Our strategy at Agnico, Hudbay and now <span class="companylink">Goldcorp</span> was really to diversify that exploration risk through the juniors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That also provides you 
the opportunity to leverage management in jurisdictions and districts 
that maybe you don’t have an expertise in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Give them the capital, 
and if they’re successful, re-up. And if they’re not, cycle the capital 
to other another opportunity. That gives you some steady optionality in 
your <b>pipeline</b>, and you can populate your <b>pipeline</b> over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Could you comment on 
using that approach when there are extended market downturns like the 
one we just came out of? Is there a better way to support exploration, 
or are we operating at the whim of the market?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DG: I think we can 
complement the market. When the juniors have access to capital markets, 
we tend to have less engagement with them, which is fine and we can 
watch them from afar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it’s good to be able to act as a bit of a merchant bank when the capital markets aren’t there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently that hasn’t been
 the case, though not for all juniors. The market has been a bit 
surgical in terms of allocating capital to the junior space, and we’re 
been able enter the breach and that has given us exposure to some very 
good management teams and very prospective ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Kelvin, what is Barrick's strategy when it comes to investing in juniors?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KD: We’ve announced in the last 18 months three particular investments: most recently with <span class="companylink">Atac Resources</span>
 in the Yukon, before that with Osisko in northern Quebec, and before 
that Alicanto in Guyana. We like all three of those opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The approach we’re taking
 is certainly not a shotgun approach. We spent a lot of time evaluating 
the management teams, and we’re very pleased with the exploration groups
 that are on the ground. And our ability to participate in the program 
is supposed to be passive, in that respect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You should expect to see more of that from us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at the same time, 
we’ve increased our budget both for brownfield and greenfield 
exploration. Part of that is because of the results we received at 
Goldrush in Nevada and Alturas in Chile and potentially extending into 
Argentina. Our finding cost is about US$25 an ounce, so we’re going to 
push ahead on both fronts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Going back to the 
Caspiche-Cerro Casale transaction, David you were quoted as saying that 
was done at about US$15 an ounce. So David, is it cheaper to find or buy
 ounces, and are you going to be looking for more at that US$10 to US$15
 per ounce level?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DG: We’re always going to
 be looking for opportunities that have the potential to deliver 5 to 10
 million ounces of reserves, and upwards of 500,000 ounces of annual 
production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We do believe that the 
equilibrium level of production for a senior gold company is somewhere 
in the 3 to 4 million ounce a year range. And you want to do that with 
as few assets as possible so you have economies of scale inherent in the
 districts you operate in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, we’re always looking to increase value, not increase volume.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that means driving down cost structures, but it also means, when you have the opportunity to upgrade your portfolio, do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And be quite ruthless 
about rotating capital from something at the bottom of your portfolio to
 something that can meaningfully move the needle both in terms of 
production volume over time and net asset value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Both companies have 
strong balance sheets. What are your thoughts on your abilities to pay 
out dividends to your shareholders?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DG: In a cyclical 
business it’s very, very difficult to have an ever-increasing dividend 
rate. Inevitably that creates an overhang in the stock. I’d sooner 
return capital in other forms if our balance sheet got a little sloppy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If gold ran up to 
US$2,000 an oz. for a period of time and we had all sorts of excess 
cashflow and we didn’t have investment opportunities that met our hurdle
 rate, then you could do a special dividend, a share buyback or 
something like that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reality is we have a 
collection of finite-life assets, and I think shareholders by and large 
want us to compound our returns to the extent that we can actually 
generate opportunities that meet our hurdle rates. So I’d say our 
priority is regenerating our business given its finite nature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KD: Paying a consistent 
dividend as part of total returns is important to us, and we like the 
discipline associated with that. But Dave is right, we’re at a point 
where the key over the last two years really was bringing down our debt 
and strengthening our balance sheet. We’ve reduced our debt by about 40%
 in the last two years, and liquidity is strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Depending on what happens
 you should expect us to look to increase the dividend, but we’ll be 
prudent about that. We’re not going to get ahead of ourselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Royalty and streaming 
companies compete for the same investor capital that you as miners do. 
What are the biggest advantages for investors to put money directly into
 mining companies?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KD: I think there’s space
 for streamers, royalty companies and ETFs. The advantages in investing 
in solid, operating companies is our ability to take advantage of our 
respective pipelines and add value that way, for instance with 
exploration, and the ability to manage our costs well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think that’s going to 
be key: maintaining that level of discipline, including in a rising gold
 price environment. Because that’s not what we did during the last cycle
 when prices went up and we became a little undisciplined. We didn’t 
take advantage of margin expansion, and in that context you shouldn’t 
have been buying a gold company, and that’s just a reality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. David, if we look at 
gold ETFs, they’ve become challenging for investors because they’ve 
somewhat outgrown the investable universe. We’re starting to see some 
ETF changes impact gold company valuations, more in the mid-tier and 
small-cap space. What is your overall take on the affinity investors 
have for ETFs over individual mining companies?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DG: It’s created a bit of
 a disconnect. And I’m not saying this to whine, it’s just a reality 
that an increasing amount of capital in equity markets is being managed 
by machines. And the machines are generally focused on the multiples and
 the valuation metrics that are prevalent across other industries, which
 are short-term price to earnings, short-term price to cashflow, etc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so what we’ve seen is a lot more volatility around quarterly earnings releases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, our investment
 horizon’s quite a bit longer in the mining space. It’s a minimum of a 
decade from discovery to first gold pour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so sometimes we have 
to make investment decisions for the long term that might not get the 
kind of traction in the marketplace in the short term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That presents a 
challenge, and I don’t know what the answer is. Perhaps a much stronger 
metal price will resolve that in the short term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. David, do you see a wave of consolidation coming in the gold space, particularly in the mid-tier?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DG: It’s challenging to 
do that, because there aren’t too many players of significance left in 
the gold sector. Quite often the companies that might be obvious targets
 for sector consolidation generally have a disparate collection of 
assets geographically and geologically that might not fit the existing 
portfolios of established producers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So you’re ending up 
having to buy maybe five or six assets in a portfolio to get the one 
that you like. That erodes the value proposition when you do that, 
because then you have to go into the divestiture phase for the assets 
that are non-core. I can guarantee you are unlikely to realize the value
 if the bankers are pitching you going into that kind of transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The model going forward 
for replacing reserves is to collaborate on large-scale opportunities 
and reduce the capital burden through that collaboration. This means 
consolidating districts and sharing the financial and technical risk 
required to bring some of these large-scale geological opportunities 
forward to mine production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How do we ensure Canada remains a sector leader globally in gold mining?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DG: It’s hard to kill. 
There was a lot of consternation that the base metals sector 
consolidated quite dramatically about ten years ago, but it’s like 
chopping off the top of a hedge — it grows back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There’s that 
entrepreneurial class within the mining space in Canada that’s second to
 none. I don’t know as robust a junior sector that there is in Canada, 
and that’s helped regenerate the industry in a significant way, even 
after massive consolidation like that. And that’s true in the gold space
 as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KD: It’s in our DNA, and 
it’s up to us to protect it and promote it. We have the pole position, 
and I think we’ll continue to keep it.</p>

 Alberta government's Climate Leadership Plan, which average Albertans 
know now as the Carbon Tax, has had a financial effect on virtually 
every single purchase we make. Besides the obvious direct cost on 
everyday consumer items, the plan has had an adverse effect on Alberta's
 energy sector which is obviously not in the provinces best interests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <b>social license</b>
 claims that accompanied the passage of the Alberta government's plan 
has apparently not been accepted by their British Columbian brethren, 
who have teamed up with the BC Green Party, who "are determined to 
immediately employ every tool available to the new government and stop 
the expansion of the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> <b>pipeline</b>"
 from being built. What we have learned is that licensing agreements 
that are expected to cross jurisdictional lines must have universal 
approval by the government, where the license is attempting to be used; 
something this Alberta government obviously did not do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To say the <b>social license</b>
 myth being sold to us by our Alberta government has been a failure is 
an understatement. MLA for Chestermere Rockyview, Leela Aheer delivered 
an impassioned Member's Statement that captured what the government's <b>social license</b> has amounted to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For two years this government has been imposing ideological tax hikes and caps on our oil sands, all in the name of <b>social license</b>.
 The Premier conned Albertans, undermined the authority and integrity of
 our national energy regulators to excuse her long-held radical 
environmental agenda." -Leela Aheer The Alberta government have created 
an unspoken pact with the LEAP Manifesto and environmental radicals like
 Tzeporah Berman, who after the BC NDP and Green Party announced their 
coalition government, celebrated on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>
 by saying "this a turning point for BC." This is hardly a productive 
attitude coming from a member of the Alberta Oilsands advisory group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It appears that <b>social license</b>
 is nothing more than the snake oil its perceived benefits are turning 
out to be. The cost to Albertans for this snake oil is real and it can 
be measured in financial, job, and investment losses. It would serve the
 Premier and the Alberta government well to stop working for the 
environmental radicals, quit perpetuating the myth of <b>social license</b>, and start working for Albertans.</p>

 This is shaping up to be maybe the blockbuster fight of the summer. On 
one side, you've got Alberta's NDP premier, Rachel Notley and Justin 
Trudeau. They want to build the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain <b>pipeline</b>
 from Edmonton to Burnaby, BC. On the other side, you've got the BC NDP,

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
JOHN HORGAN (BC NDP Leader): Good morning, Evan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Is the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> <b>pipeline</b> dead if you become the premier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HORGAN: Well, certainly, 
it's a divisive issue in British Columbia, and one that we've been 
following for a number of years now. In fact, going back to 2011, 2012 
when <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> started accelerating their plans to twin the existing <b>pipeline</b>.
 It's divisive issue and we know now that a number of First Nations in 
the Burrard Inlet area are already in court. The Tsleil-Waututh, the 
Musqueam and the Squamish nations do not want to see this <b>pipeline</b>
 proceed into their territory. The city of the Burnaby, the city of the 
Vancouver are big players in British Columbia, of course. And, and now 
we'll have a government of New Democrats and Greens that are concerned 
that the impact of a seven-fold increase on tanker traffic through our 
major metropolitan area, through the Salish Sea and up the Strait Juan 
de Fuca is not in our interest, and we're going to be absolutely clear 
on that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Okay. I want to be, let me try to be more clear. Is the <b>pipeline</b> dead? If you become the premier, are you going to say no and try to block that <b>pipeline</b>,
 because you know the federal government has the jurisdiction to ram it 
through if they want. They've got the constitutional power. Would you 
let that happen?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HORGAN: I understand the position that Mr. Trudeau is in. Rachel Notley is a friend of mine. We have agreed to disagree on the <b>pipeline</b>
 issue. We have many other issues of agreement. But on this fundamental 
question, British Columbian's interests have to come first for me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Okay. The 
environment minister, just on the program, Catherine McKenna, she said 
she'd be willing to negotiate with you on that, to make assure this <b>pipeline</b> goes through, get that so-called <b>social license</b>. Would you be willing to negotiate with the federal government to try to get a <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> <b>pipeline</b> twinned?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HORGAN: I'm anxious to 
sit down with the prime minister to talk about a range of issues. First 
and foremost for me would be, of course, softwood lumber. I was excited 
to see the federal response late last week to the, the, what is going to
 be a looming crisis in the forest sector here in British Columbia. 
Fifty percent of the trade between Canada and the US on softwood is the 
result of BC forests, and BC workers, and I want to ensure that we have a
 clear understanding that the federal government's going to be there for
 BC workers and we're going to be aggressive on that trade file. There's
 a whole number of issues at I am excited to work with the prime 
minister on - housing, the Fentanyl crisis, the list is much longer the 
things that we agree on...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: No, I get that, and I...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HORGAN: ...than those that we disagree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Just tell me. Are you willing to negotiate, so there's still a possibility that you would also accept that <b>pipeline</b>?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HORGAN: I will address 
that when the opportunity presents itself, Evan. I've laid out how the 
First Nations in the region and the two mayors in the major cities in 
the Burrard Inlet feel about this. I'm going to consult with attorney 
general's ministry upon forming a government and look at our legal 
options at that time. We have a number of other tools in the toolbox 
when it comes to permitting, and we'll follow through on those. I'm 
happy to sit down with the prime minister at an early opportunity to 
talk about pipelines, to talk about softwood, to talk about Fentanyl, to
 talk about childcare...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Okay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HORGAN: ...housing and on and on it goes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: And I'm, I 
assume you'll be dealing with Donald Trump on softwood lumber, on energy
 issues. If you become the premier, I guess he's an early visit for you,
 right?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HORGAN: Well, I've made 
it quite clear in my election campaign that that one of my first orders 
of business is to go Washington and make it clear. Rachel Notley's gone 
to protect the interests of Alberta. Brad Wall has gone to protect the 
interests of Saskatchewan. We need to have a BC representative making it
 abundantly clear that we have had a positive working relationship with 
the United States for many, many decades and we want to continue that. 
But we're not patsies here, and we have cards to play. As I say, the 
Columbia River treaty being first among them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: All right, John 
Horgan, could be the next premier of British Columbia in the next couple
 of weeks. We are watching that very closely. Sir, thank you very much 
for joining us. Appreciate it.</p>

"Question Period", the US joins Syria and Nicaragua as the three 
countries who have now opted out of the Paris climate accord. Is that 
good or bad for the economy here in Canada? The scrum is next, and our

PHILIPPE COUILLARD (Quebec Premier): We are all Quebecers, and therefore
 we can all say in French and in English, (speaking in French). Being a 
Quebecer is our way of being Canadians.</p>

 It's back. That's right. The most divisive debate in the country, the 
one that almost tore Canada apart has been shockingly re-opened by 
Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard. He argues that Canada's 150th 
birthday is the perfect time to crack open the Constitution and make 
Quebec a distinct society. Well the scrum is back to tackle that one. 
Stephanie Levitz is back. Joyce Napier is back. Craig Oliver is back. 
And we now bring our special guests, filmmaker Avi Lewis, who is the 
strategic director of the LEAP, which called for an end to, among other 
things, more development of the oilsands. Thanks for being, Avi, and 
joining the scrum. I'm going to start with you. We all remember these 
debates about the Constitution, the distinct society, Mulroney, boy, why
 do you think Philippe Couillard is doing this now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AVI LEWIS (Strategic 
Director of the LEAP): I think he's feeling pressure from the 
sovereigntist left. I think, I think he's got Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois 
fear. He's seeing, we've seen the PQ abandon being a left-wing party, 
essentially, and become a neo Liberal austerity party, and we're seeing 
the rise of the Quebec Solidaire, and all of a sudden Couillard realizes
 that young people in Quebec are galvanized, not necessarily by 
sovereignty, but by a progressive agenda, which is represented in his 
province now by a sovereignist party. So, I think we may be seeing a 
reconfiguration of the landscape. It took them a while to get the whole 
issue that there might be a little problem between Quebec and the rest 
of the Canada. So now he's trying to make up some ground locally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Well, Craig, here we go again. What do you think about it?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: ...on an 
intellectual forced march, chasing around constitutional talks, and I'll
 tell you one thing about them - whatever nobility they may start in, 
they end in mud. And what Couillard is doing is being a political powder
 monkey. That's what they call the guy on a construction crew in charge 
of dynamite who blows things up. He's going to blow up every, this whole
 issue. Everybody will want to get into it. There will be endless fights
 and squabbles and it could end with defeated governments. It could end 
with the country up for grabs again, as we've seen in the past. This 
could be a mess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: All right. If it is a, political expediency, Joyce, as, as Avi argues, is he playing with dynamite, as Craig says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JOYCE NAPIER (<span class="companylink">CTV</span>

First of all, it's so 1990s, you know, let me get with the program. That
 was a long time ago. Those of us who had the pleasure of covering those
 debates know these long debates about commas, or semicolons. It's just 
doesn't work. It's 1990s. Let's bring back shoulder pads and, why not, 
Farrah Fawcett hair. I don't know. Why is he digging this out? It could 
blow up in his face, because if indeed Avi is right, and he wants to 
counter this, this sort of rising conservativism, or progressive wave in
 Quebec, it may also turn against him, right? The rest of the country 
doesn't want it. And you don't just open a little bit of a 
constitutional debate. We all know it. It's going to open it big and 
wide and then we're going to put everything in there.</p>

time of, there's big things going on. There's big trade negotiations. 
I'm sure the federal government is not happy. Justin Trudeau immediately
 said, we are not interested in this. He was unequivocal. Is this the

this thing starts and it's uncontrollable?</p>

dismiss it because you're bored of it. Don't say because there are

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: And they never

Supreme Court. The own a quarter of the, the senate. The idea that they 
somehow have opted out, and they want back in, it just doesn't work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: This, okay, I 
would say, it is fair to say that a constitutional wound is not fixed. I
 guess the question is for Philippe Couillard, why try to do it now? 
Timing matters in politics, and speaking of timing, at one point, Justin
 Trudeau had timing on his hand. He had an NDP government in Alberta 
that said, okay, we'll put a cap on oilsands emissions. We'll buy into 
your price on carbon. Give us the Trans Mountain, the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> <b>pipeline</b>
 from Alberta to Burnaby, BC. He had a Liberal government in BC that 
said, okay, you know, we'll, we'll do that. Now with the results in BC, 
which could be an NDP-Green government. Avi Lewis, is <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> dead?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEWIS: Yeah. Yeah, I 
think it effectively is. It might well have been otherwise. There's 
something called an extraordinary coalition of First Nations, that is 
already in the way, the treaty alliance to, to stop the pipelines. There
 were going to be court challenges. There were challenges from cities 
in, in British Columbia. It was never the sure thing that Notley and 
Trudeau wanted to present it as. But I think Christy Clark might have 
lost this election on <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>. 
Sixty percent of the province voted for parties who were very clear on 
the position. And I think it's revealed, what I'm really excited about 
in this moment is just that we can refocus the debate on the principles 
and the facts and the benefits to people in different parts of this 
land, instead of having politicians blaming, this sort of caricature of 
environmentalists for being against pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Yeah, here's what I don't understand...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEWIS: It's the people of British Columbia that are against it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Rachel Notley's an NDP premier. "Mark my words," she says, Stephanie. "That <b>pipeline</b>
 will be built." So now you've got an NDP premier in Alberta telling a 
potential NDP premier in British Columbia, like, showdown. My political 
life depends on your decision. How does that play out?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEVITZ: I mean, I think 
it's so fascinating because, you know, premier, the prime minister has 
staked so much on this concept of <b>social license</b>, right, of 
convincing people to come onside, and his whole argument that 
environmental benefits require economic benefits and all of these things
 and now he's looking down, and how much political capital is Justin 
Trudeau going to want to spend on this thing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Joyce?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAPIER: He was asked 
clearly in Rome, and you know, he's usually on talking points. It's hard
 sometimes to get a real answer from the prime minister, or even his 
cabinet. And I asked him that question, specifically, are you willing to
 go against their will? Talking obviously about the NDP-Green coalition,
 and his answer was crystal clear, it was "yes". Those were fighting 
words coming from the prime minister of Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLIVER: Let's remember 
that an awful lot of the people who voted for him as a Liberal in 
British Columbia voted NDP in the election. They are strong 
environmentalists. Trudeau has a lot to lose here. But he's stuck now. 
He's got to not just fight for this <b>pipeline</b>. He's got to endorse this <b>pipeline</b>, because he and the <b>pipeline</b>, their fates are entwined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: And so, and Rachel Notley's fate may be entwined, as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAPIER: Yeah, but we're 
assuming, but we're assuming this vote was just against pipelines. Maybe
 it was just against, they, they wanted change. Maybe the voters there 
wanted change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: You may be right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEWIS: I think, I think 
there's a much bigger, there's a much bigger issue here. Evan, when you 
started the show here, we go again, I thought we were going into the <b>pipeline</b>
 debate. Like how, here we are, day after day, month after month 
debating these 19th century economic levers. Where is the renewable 
energy project that stands like a beacon, a nation building project from
 coast to coast to coast in this country, that actually announces 
Canada, in the abdication of the United States from real climate 
progress, we have an opportunity lead the world in renewable energy. We 
have extraordinary capacity here and we have communities across the 
country that are already doing it on a small scale because we're missing
 the big picture. Where's the vision for this 21st century economy that 
could lead the Canada?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Okay last word to Stephanie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEVITZ: But to pay it for, you need the export the oil, and, and that's the problem that Justin Trudeau has right?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEWIS: No you don't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEVITZ: If he wants the money fund his...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEWIS: No, that's just, that's just not true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEVITZ: ...natural resource.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEWIS: That's just absolutely not true. That's absolutely not true. We've got...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Well, Avi, I'll give you ten seconds on this one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEWIS: We have corporations enough money to pay the national debt. There's plenty of money in this Canada...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Although the fate of Rachel Notley might be tied up. If she doesn't get a <b>pipeline</b> and there's a united Conservative movement in Alberta, then what happens to Justin Trudeau's national price on carbon?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEWIS: You know the price
 on carbon, we're seeing all the pressure now being framed, mostly by 
like, okay, I'll say it, Ottawa pundits like you, as pressure from the 
now retrograde nihilist, denialist United States, that suddenly a carbon
 price is going to be a hindrance to Canada's economy. Actually, look 
what Emmanuel Macron did after Trump pulled out of the, out of the Paris
 deal. He went on national television, and he said engineers, 
entrepreneurs, I want you to think of France as your second homeland. 
Come and let's build a renewable energy future together. What do we get 
from Justin Trudeau? Deeply disappointed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEWIS: Come on. (Inaudible) vision here. There's huge, huge opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: It's true. I, 
I've got to go, but I will say, from Mr. Macron, strong words from a 
country that has 60 percent, plus, of its energy is nuclear energy. I 
wonder if you'd support that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEWIS: Fair enough. And you know how much it cost me to say anything good about that neo Liberal streak, as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLOMON: Well, there you go. All right...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEWIS: It's not something I do, it's not something I do readily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is Avi Lewis. That 
is Joyce Napier, Stephanie Levitz and Craig Oliver, I want to thank as 
all of you for being here. Great to have you on the program. A big week 
ahead, by the way. The government will announce its long-awaited plan 
for Canada's military. We've got our eyes on that.</p>
