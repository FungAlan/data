<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokered Subscription Receipt Financing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In conjunction with the 
closing of the Transaction, 51st Parallel has entered into an agreement 
with the Agents, for a brokered private placement offering of Initial 
Subscription Receipts on a best efforts agency basis at the Issue Price 
for aggregate gross proceeds of up to $50.0 million. The Financing is 
expected to close on or about August 21, 2018. Each Initial Subscription
 Receipt will be exchangeable into one 51st Parallel Share without any 
further action required on the part of the holder of the Initial 
Subscription Receipt and without payment of any additional 
consideration, upon the closing of the Transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gross proceeds from 
the Financing will be held in escrow pending the completion of the 
Transaction, which is expected to close on or around September 28, 2018.
 If all conditions to the completion of the Transaction (other than 
funding) are satisfied on or before October 31, 2018, the net proceeds 
from the sale of the Initial Subscription Receipts will be released from
 escrow to 51st Parallel and each Initial Subscription Receipt will be 
exchanged for one 51st Parallel Share. If the Transaction is not 
completed on or before October 31, 2018, or is terminated at an earlier 
time, then the purchase price for the Initial Subscription Receipts will
 be returned to subscribers, together with a pro rata portion of 
interest earned on the escrowed funds, if any.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Agents will be 
entitled to receive from 51st Parallel a cash commission equal to 6% of 
the gross proceeds of the Financing upon the release to 51st Parallel of
 the escrowed funds on the closing date of the Transaction. The Agents 
have the option to purchase additional Initial Subscription Receipts, 
exercisable in whole or in part at the Issue Price, at any time up to 48
 hours prior to closing of the Transaction, for additional aggregate 
gross proceeds of up to $7.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The net proceeds of the 
Financing will be used to fund the GCH Transaction, 51st Parallel’s 
operations and for work capital and general corporate purposes. 
Completion of the Financing is a condition precedent to the completion 
of the Transaction. In the event 51st Parallel is unable to complete the
 Financing on satisfactory terms, 51st Parallel and CBi2 will be unable

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jean-Yves Lavoie reports</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">JUNEX INC</span>. AND CUDA <b>ENERGY</b> INC. ANNOUNCE STRATEGIC BUSINESS COMBINATION AND HIGH GROWTH WYOMING POWDER RIVER BASIN LIGHT OIL ACQUISITION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Junex Inc</span>. and Cuda <b>Energy</b> Inc.,
 a private Alberta-based exploration and development company, have 
entered into an arm's-length arrangement agreement dated June 8, 2018, 
that provides for the combination of Cuda and Junex to create a new, 
well-capitalized, high-netback, light-oil North American producer 
focused on delivering strong organic growth to shareholders. The 
combination of Cuda and Junex will be completed by way of plan of 
arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (Quebec). The 
arrangement steps will result in the combination of Cuda and Junex under
 the new name Cuda Oil and Gas Inc. Based on a ratio of 55:45 between 
the existing shareholders of Junex and Cuda, respectively, each Cuda 
shareholder will receive 3.5856 common shares and 0.4167 of an 
arrangement warrant of new Cuda for each Cuda share held resulting in 
the issuance of approximately 86.0 million common shares and 10.0 
million arrangement warrants to Cuda shareholders on a preconsolidation 
basis. In connection with the arrangement, new Cuda shall complete a 
10-for-one share consolidation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Cuda will be led by 
the existing management team of Cuda including R. Glenn Dawson as 
president and chief executive officer, Terry Schneider as chief 
operating officer, Ron Purvis as chief financial officer, Tim Bushell as
 executive vice-president of exploration, Chad Gutor as vice-president 
of engineering and from Junex, Mathieu Lavoie as vice-president, Quebec.
 The Cuda management team has a record of generating strong shareholder 
returns over the past three decades developing assets in Canada and the 
United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upon completion of the 
arrangement, the new Cuda board of directors will consist of a total of 
seven members: five from Cuda, being Edward (Ted) Hirst, Rich Frommer, 
Scott Dawson, Bruce Lawrence, R. Glenn Dawson, and two from Junex, being
 Jean-Yves Lavoie and a second member to be selected prior to mailing of
 the information circular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Cuda is also pleased 
to announce that it has entered into a definitive agreement with an 
arm's-length party to acquire a high-growth light oil asset in the 
Powder River basin in Wyoming for total consideration of $37-million 
(U.S.). The Wyoming assets consist of 25,000 gross acres, which will be 
developed through vertical development drilling along with four 
additional deeper zones where several large United States independents 
have licensed 5,000 horizontal wells and are developing these deeper 
zones via horizontal development and achieving initial 30-day rates in 
excess of 1,000 barrels per day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are excited about the
 opportunity to partner with the Cuda team who have demonstrated a 
history of successfully growing oil and gas companies while maintaining 
strong relationships with stakeholders. We feel the Cuda team's track 
record of shareholder returns, experience operating in the U.S. and 
Canada, and prior exposure to the Utica shale in Ohio and West Virginia 
is a unique skill set that will be invaluable to the shareholders of the
 combined company. After reviewing all the alternatives available to 
Junex, we are confident that our partnership with Cuda will provide 
strong cash flow from high-quality oil and gas assets in Wyoming and 
Alberta, creating value for shareholders while awaiting on impactful 
development in Quebec. We are encouraged by the fact that shareholders 
holding 14.24 per cent of our shares have executed support agreements in
 favour of the transaction, in addition to the verbal support received 
from holders of an additional approximately 25 per cent of the shares," 
said Junex's president and chief executive officer, Jean-Yves Lavoie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Cuda management team
 has spent extensive time reviewing and analyzing Junex's assets, and 
based on our past exposure to the Utica shale gas development in Ohio 
and West Virginia, we are confident in the economic viability of Junex's
 Lowlands assets. We look forward to working with the Junex team, the 
government of Quebec and the citizens of Quebec to advance Junex's 
scalable projects on a timeline that respects the rights of all 
stakeholders of Quebec. In addition, we are delighted to have the 
opportunity to acquire the Wyoming assets, which we believe offers a 
rare combination of low-cost and low-risk development drilling and 
significant upside via multiple stacked oil producing zones. As high 
land costs and transportation bottlenecks have created challenges for 
other shale oil plays in the U.S., we believe the Powder River basin 
will continue to see increased activity and deal flow over the next 
several years," said Cuda president and chief executive officer R. Glenn
 Dawson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The asset acquisition</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Junex has entered into a 
definitive agreement with an arm's-length party to acquire the Wyoming 
assets, concurrently with the completion of the arrangement, for total 
consideration of $37-million (U.S.), prior to adjustments, consisting of
 approximately 20.9 million new Cuda shares (preconsolidation) having a 
deemed value of $6-million (U.S.) and $31-million (U.S.) in cash. The 
vendor has agreed to enter into a lock-up agreement under which it shall
 not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of, any of its new Cuda shares 
until the date that is six months after the date of the closing of the 
asset acquisition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wyoming assets 
consist of a 27.75-per-cent interest in the 25,000-acre (about 7,000 
net) Barron Flats (deep) unit in the Powder River basin. The Wyoming 
assets are currently producing approximately over 1,000 barrels of oil 
equivalent (280 boe/d net) of high-netback (92-per-cent light oil) 
production entirely from the Shannon formation. Based on a $65 
(U.S.)/bbl oil price, the assets are capable of generating operating 
netbacks of greater than $50/bbl, which is supported by the reserve 
report prepared by Ryder Scott Petroleum Consultants. New Cuda has 
identified up to 70 infill locations into the Shannon formation, which 
will be drilled vertically for about $1.0-million (U.S.) per well, 
recover approximately 150,000 bbl of oil per well and are forecasted to 
generate internal rate of return of greater than 200 per cent and payout
 in less than eight months (as calculated in the Ryder Scott reserve 
report based on the primary recovery factor type curve). New Cuda 
believes that primary development should recover 15 per cent of the oil 
in place with the potential to recover up to 50 per cent of the oil in 
place through the implementation of a miscible gas flood. New Cuda 
anticipates that gas will start being injected into a single pilot well 
by August, 2018, and subject to a positive response, the company plans 
to commence field-wide injection in the first quarter of 2019 upon 
approval of the Federal Secondary Recovery Unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the 
Shannon formation, new Cuda has identified bypassed pay in four 
additional deeper zones. Two of those deeper zones (Frontier and Muddy) 
have already proven productive with historical vertical wells having 
recovered over 100,000 bbl of light oil each. Several large industry 
operators are actively developing these deeper zones offsetting the 
lands to be acquired. Based on recent positive horizontal drilling 
results (where IP 30s have consistently exceeded 1,000 bbl/d light oil),
 have licensed over 5,000 horizontal drilling locations within the Sand 
Dunes megaproject area. While new Cuda's initial capital program will 
focus on the Shannon formation, new Cuda will target the potential in 
the deeper zones and plan to drill a deep strat test to prove up 
additional conventional and unconventional reserves before year-end 
2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Cuda will be 
participating with the vendor of the Wyoming assets to jointly develop, 
construct, own and operate an oil sales pipeline connecting to regional 
infrastructure and a high-pressure natural gas system to facilitate gas 
volumes required to implement the miscible gas flood into the Shannon 
field. The Mid-stream facilities will be owned 33-1/3rds per cent by New
 Cuda and 66-2/3rds per cent by the vendor, and will be operated by an 
affiliate of the vendor. New Cuda will contribute $5-million (U.S.) for 
construction and development of this project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a mutual condition 
to completion of the arrangement that the asset acquisition shall be 
completed concurrently with completion of the arrangement and the 
closing of the acquisition facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strategic rationale of the transactions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Management and the board 
of directors of each of Cuda and Junex believe that their respective 
shareholders will benefit from the following attributes of new Cuda:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Experienced management 
team with an established record of delivering strong shareholder returns
 driven by organic production and reserves growth;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Premium sweet 40 API 
light oil focused asset base in Wyoming with low risk infill vertical 
drilling and several deeper zones that have already been proven 
economic;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Top quartile operating netbacks forecasted to average approximately $33/boe in the second half of 2018 based on strip pricing;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- 1,200 boe/d low decline productive capacity growing to 2,000 boe/d by the end of 2018;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Targeting up to 100-per-cent production growth spending approximately cash flow at current strip prices;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- A focused portfolio of quick payout, low-risk drilling opportunities targeting the Shannon formation in Wyoming;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Exposure to two large 
resources in Quebec through the Galt light oil project and approximately
 one million gross acres of land prospective for Utica shale gas;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- A strong liquidity 
position with $15-million of unrestricted cash, which will be focused on
 the development of light oil assets in Wyoming and an additional 
$7.5-million of capital dedicated to the development of the Galt project
 in Quebec;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Increased market capitalization providing for enhanced liquidity. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overview of Junex and Cuda assets</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Junex holds a 
52.87-per-cent working interest and is the operator of the Galt oil 
discovery in the Gaspe region of Quebec. Junex's Galt-4 horizontal oil 
well tested at 206 barrels per day unstimulated, illustrating the 
potential deliverability of the play. New Cuda will continue <b>social acceptance</b>
 efforts in the Gaspe region in order to develop this field with the 
support of the local population while also protecting the environment. <span class="companylink">Netherland Sewell &amp; Associates Inc</span>.
 estimates (in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 standards of 
disclosure) as at May 31, 2015, the Galt project holds 81 million bbl of
 best estimate discovered OOIP. Pursuant to an agreement between Junex 
and <span class="companylink">Investissement Quebec</span>, IQ agreed to
 finance $8.4-million toward Junex and IQ's future expenditures on the 
Galt project in order to earn a 17-per-cent interest in the project. To 
date, approximately $900,000 has been spent on the Galt project. In 
addition to the $7.5-million of restricted cash related to the Galt 
project, Junex has $15.6-million of unrestricted cash which will be used
 to finance future development and the acquisition of the Wyoming 
assets. For additional details regarding the aforementioned resource 
estimate and the terminology used in this study, please refer to Junex's
 press release of Aug. 31, 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the Galt 
project, Junex is one of the largest landholders in Quebec, holding 
approximately one million gross acres in the St. Lawrence lowlands 
prospective for Utica shale gas. Netherland Sewell &amp; Associates 
estimates (in accordance with NI 51-101 standards of disclosure) as at 
Dec. 31, 2009, that Junex's lands hold 3,500 cubic feet of net best 
estimate unrisked prospective resource. Based on its experience 
developing the Utica in Ohio and West Virgina, the new Cuda management 
team is confident in the economic viability of developing the Utica 
across the Junex land base. New Cuda will actively work with local 
communities to gain <b>social acceptance</b> while also promoting the 
fact that natural gas in the lowlands can be developed in compliance 
with high environmental standards and minimal impact on the population 
of Quebec, while creating high-quality jobs, and lowering emissions both
 globally and in Quebec by displacing higher-emission <b>energy</b> sources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Alberta, Cuda has 
current productive capacity of 900 boe/d and an extensive portfolio of 
exploration opportunities where it estimates that it can drill six 
independent light oil targets by risking $2.5-million of capital (based 
on dry-hole cost). In the second half of 2018, new Cuda anticipates 
drilling three exploration wells (100-per-cent working interest), which 
may be expanded based on success. Cuda currently holds approximately 
$3-million in cash and 3.78 million warrants with an exercise price of 
50 cents per Cuda share (new Cuda equivalent of 13.9 cents 
preconsolidation) which expire June 25, 2018, and if exercised, would 
result in $1.9-million in additional cash proceeds to Cuda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outlook</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upon completion of the 
transactions and the acquisition facility, new Cuda is planning to start
 a 15-to-20-(gross)-well drilling program in the second half of 2018 
targeting the Shannon light oil pool in the Powder River basin. The 2018
 capital program is expected to primarily consist of its high-graded, 
high-efficiency Shannon inventory where it can achieve paybacks of 
approximately eight months based on current strip pricing and a modest 
southern Alberta exploration program targeting high-impact light oil 
projects. New Cuda anticipates achieving 2018 exit production of 2,000 
boe/d (60-per-cent oil and liquids). New Cuda will continue to advance 
Junex's portfolio of oil and gas projects in preparation for continuing 
improvement of the oil and gas industry in Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The acquisition facility</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In connection with the 
transactions, Cuda has entered into an agreement, with an arm's-length 
party, with respect to a $35-million acquisition facility agreement with
 a Canadian institutional lender. Under the terms of the acquisition 
facility, interest will accrue monthly on the outstanding balance of the
 acquisition facility at a rate of 10.5 per cent per annum and shall be 
payable monthly. The acquisition facility is payable on demand and will 
mature 12 months from closing of the transaction and Cuda may repay the 
acquisition facility in whole or in part and all accrued interest at any
 time prior with 90 days notice. The acquisition facility will have 
first ranking security over the assets of the new Cuda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proceeds of the acquisition facility will be used to finance the asset acquisition and for general working capital purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arrangement warrant terms</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each whole arrangement 
warrant will entitle the holder thereof to purchase one new Cuda share 
at a price of 40 cents per share ($4 postconsolidation) for a period of 
24 months following the completion of the arrangement. The arrangement 
warrants will vest upon the earlier of (i) the date on which the new 
Cuda shares achieve a 20-day weighted average price of 64 cents per 
share ($6.40 postconsolidation) and (ii) the date on which new Cuda 
completes an equity financing of a minimum of $10-million at price of at
 least 60 cents per share ($6 postconsolidation).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recommendations of the boards of directors and shareholder support agreements</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The board of directors of
 each of Cuda and Junex has unanimously approved the arrangement, 
determined that the arrangement is in the best interests of each of 
Cuda, Junex and their respective shareholders, and have unanimously 
determined to recommend that holders of Cuda shares and Junex shares, 
respectively, vote their shares in favour of the arrangement. 
Shareholders of Cuda holding in the aggregate in excess of 72 per cent 
of the issued and outstanding Cuda shares, including all of the 
directors and officers and certain other shareholders, have agreed to 
vote their shares in favour of the arrangement. Shareholders of Junex 
holding in the aggregate approximately 14.24 per cent of the issued and 
outstanding Junex shares, including all of the directors, officers and 
certain other shareholders, have agreed to vote their shares in favour 
of the arrangement (excluding the holders of an additional approximately
 25 per cent, who have provided verbal support as mentioned previously).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, an 
institution which currently holds $1-million face value convertible 
debentures of Junex has agreed to convert its convertible debenture into
 approximately 2.7 million preconsolidation common shares (270,000 
postconsolidation common shares) of new Cuda in connection with the 
transactions, the whole at a price of 37.2 cents per preconsolidation 
common share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conditions and shareholder meetings</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Completion of the 
arrangement remains subject to satisfaction of certain conditions 
including completion of the asset acquisition, the receipt of all 
necessary regulatory approvals, the approval of the <span class="companylink">TSX Venture Exchange</span>,
 the approval of the Superior Court of Quebec, the requisite approvals 
of the shareholders of each of Cuda and Junex, and the satisfaction of 
certain other conditions that are customary for a transaction of this 
nature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the terms of the 
arrangement agreement, Cuda and Junex have each agreed that it will not 
solicit or initiate any inquiries or discussions regarding any other 
business combination or sale of assets, subject to the fiduciary duty of
 the board of directors of both Cuda and Junex in the event that an 
unsolicited superior proposal is received by either Cuda or Junex. Cuda 
and Junex have granted the other a seven-business-day right to match any
 superior proposal. The arrangement agreement provides for mutual 
non-completion fees of up to $2-million in the event that the 
arrangement is not completed or is terminated by either party in certain
 circumstances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A joint management 
information circular outlining details of the transactions is expected

 Inc. ("Cuda"), a private Alberta based exploration and development 
company, are pleased to announce they have entered into an arm’s-length 
arrangement agreement dated June 8, 2018 (the "Arrangement Agreement") 
that provides for the combination of Cuda and Junex to create a new, 
well-capitalized, high netback, light oil, North American producer 
focused on delivering strong organic growth to shareholders. The 
combination of Cuda and Junex will be completed by way of plan of 
arrangement (the "Arrangement") under the Business Corporations Act 
(Québec). The Arrangement steps will result in the combination of Cuda 
and Junex under the new name Cuda Oil and Gas Inc. ("New Cuda"). Based 
on a ratio of 55:45 between the existing shareholders of Junex and Cuda,
 respectively, each Cuda shareholder will receive 3.5856 common shares 
and 0.4167 of an arrangement warrant of New Cuda for each Cuda share 
held resulting in the issuance of approximately 86.0 million common 
shares and 10.0 million arrangement warrants to Cuda shareholders on a 
pre consolidation basis. In connection with the Arrangement New Cuda 
shall complete a 10 for 1 share consolidation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Cuda will be led by 
the existing management team of Cuda including R. Glenn Dawson as 
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer, Terry Schneider as COO, Ron 
Purvis as Chief Financial Officer, Tim Bushell as Executive Vice 
President Exploration, Chad Gutor Vice President Engineering and from 
Junex Mathieu Lavoie Vice President Québec. The Cuda management team has
 a track record of generating strong shareholder returns over the past 
three decades developing assets in Canada and the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upon completion of the 
Arrangement, the New Cuda board of directors will be comprised of a 
total of seven members: five from Cuda, being Edward (Ted) Hirst, Rich 
Frommer, Scott Dawson, Bruce Lawrence, R. Glenn Dawson, and two from 
Junex, being Jean-Yves Lavoie and a second member to be selected prior 
to mailing of the information circular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Cuda is also pleased 
to announce that it has entered into a definitive agreement with an 
arm’s-length party to acquire a high growth light oil asset in the 
Powder River Basin in Wyoming (the "WyomingAssets") for total 
consideration of US$37 million. The Wyoming Assets consist of 25,000 
gross acres which will be developed through vertical development 
drilling along with four additional deeper zones where several large 
U.S. independents have licensed 5,000 horizontal wells and are 
developing these deeper zones via horizontal development and achieving 
initial 30 day rates in excess of 1,000 bbl/d.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are excited about the
 opportunity to partner with the Cuda team who have demonstrated a 
history of successfully growing oil and gas companies while maintaining 
strong relationships with stakeholders. We feel the Cuda team’s track 
record of shareholder returns, experience operating in the U.S. and 
Canada, and prior exposure to the Utica shale in Ohio and West Virginia 
is a unique skillset that will be invaluable to the shareholders of the 
combined company. After reviewing all the alternatives available to 
Junex, we are confident that our partnership with Cuda will provide 
strong cash flow from high quality oil and gas assets in Wyoming and 
Alberta creating value for shareholders while awaiting on impactful 
development in Québec. We are encouraged by the fact that shareholders 
holding 14.24% of our shares have executed support agreements in favour 
of the transaction, in addition to the verbal support received from 
holders of an additional approximately 25% of the shares" said Junex’s 
President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Jean-Yves Lavoie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Cuda management team
 has spent extensive time reviewing and analyzing Junex’s assets, and 
based on our past exposure to the Utica shale gas development in Ohio 
and West Virginia, we are confident in the economic viability of Junex's
 Lowlands assets. We look forward to working with the Junex team, the 
government of Québec and the citizens of Québec to advance Junex's 
scalable projects on a timeline that respects the rights of all 
stakeholders of Québec. In addition, we are delighted to have the 
opportunity to acquire the Wyoming Assets which we believe offers a rare
 combination of low cost and low risk development drilling and 
significant upside via multiple stacked oil producing zones. As high 
land costs and transportation bottlenecks have created challenges for 
other shale oil plays in the US, we believe the Powder River Basin will 
continue to see increased activity and deal flow over the next several 
years." said Cuda President and Chief Executive Officer, R. Glenn 
Dawson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Asset Acquisition</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Junex has entered into a 
definitive agreement with an arm’s-length party to acquire the Wyoming 
Assets, concurrently with the completion of the Arrangement, for total 
consideration of US$37 million, prior to adjustments, comprised of 
approximately 20.9 million New Cuda Shares (pre consolidation) having a 
deemed value of US$6 million and US$31 million in cash (the "Asset 
Acquisition"). The vendor has agreed to enter into a lock-up agreement 
under which it shall not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of, any of
 its New Cuda Shares until the date that is 6 months after the date of 
the closing of the Asset Acquisition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wyoming Assets 
consist of a 27.75% interest in the 25,000 (~7,000 net) acre Barron 
Flats (Deep) Unit in the Powder River Basin. The Wyoming Assets are 
currently producing approximately over 1,000 boe/d (280 boe/d net) of 
high netback (92% light oil) production entirely from the Shannon 
formation. Based on a US$65.00/bbl oil price, the assets are capable of 
generating operating netbacks of &gt;C$50.00/bbl which is supported by 
the reserve report prepared by Ryder Scott Petroleum Consultants ("Ryder
 Scott"). New Cuda has identified up to 70 infill locations into the 
Shannon formation which will be drilled vertically for ~US$1.0 million 
per well, recover approximately 150 mbbl of oil per well and are 
forecasted to generate IRRs of &gt;200% and payout in less than 8 months
 (as calculated in the Ryder Scott reserve report based on the primary 
recovery factor type curve). New Cuda believes that primary development 
should recover 15% of the oil in place with the potential to recover up 
to 50% of the oil in place through the implementation of a miscible gas 
flood. New Cuda anticipates that gas will start being injected into a 
single pilot well by August 2018, and subject to a positive response we 
plan to commence field wide injection in Q1-2019 upon approval of the 
Federal Secondary Recovery Unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the 
Shannon formation, New Cuda has identified bypassed pay in four 
additional deeper zones. Two of those deeper zones (Frontier and Muddy) 
have already proven productive with historical vertical wells having 
recovered over 100 mbbl of light oil each. Several large industry 
operators are actively developing these deeper zones offsetting the 
lands to be acquired. Based on recent positive horizontal drilling 
results (where IP-30’s have consistently exceeded 1,000 bbl/d light 
oil), have licensed over 5,000 horizontal drilling locations within the 
Sand Dunes mega project area. While New Cuda’s initial capital program 
will focus on the Shannon formation, New Cuda will target the potential 
in the deeper zones and plan to drill a deep strat test to prove up 
additional conventional and unconventional reserves before year end 
2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Cuda will be 
participating with the vendor of the Wyoming Assets to jointly develop, 
construct, own and operate an oil sales pipeline connecting to regional 
infrastructure and a high pressure natural gas system to facilitate gas 
volumes required to implement the miscible gas flood into the Shannon 
field (the “Midstream Facilities”). The Midstream Facilities will be 
owned 331/3% by New Cuda and 662/3% by the vendor, and will be operated 
by an affiliate of the vendor. New Cuda will contribute US$5 million for
 construction and development of this project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a mutual condition 
to completion of the Arrangement that the Asset Acquisition shall be 
completed concurrently with completion of the Arrangement and the 
closing of the Acquisition Facility (as defined below; collectively the 
"Transactions").</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strategic Rationale of the Transactions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Management and the board 
of directors of each of Cuda and Junex believe that their respective

Gaspé region of Québec. Junex’s Galt-4 horizontal oil well tested at 206
 bbl/d unstimulated, illustrating the potential deliverability of the

Gaspé region in order to develop this field with the support of the 
local population while also protecting the environment. <span class="companylink">Netherland Sewell &amp; Associates Inc</span>.
 estimates (in accordance with NI 51-101 standards of disclosure) as at 
May 31, 2015 the Galt project holds 81 mmbbl of best estimate discovered
 OOIP. Pursuant to an agreement between Junex and <span class="companylink">Investissement Québec</span>
 ("IQ"), IQ agreed to fund $8.4 million towards Junex and IQ’s future 
expenditures on the Galt project in order to earn a 17% interest in the 
project. To date, approximately $0.9 million has been spent on the Galt 
project. In addition to the $7.5 million of restricted cash related to 
the Galt project, Junex has $15.6 million of unrestricted cash which 
will be used to fund future development and the acquisition of the 
Wyoming Assets. For additional details regarding the aforementioned 
resource estimate and the terminology used in this study, please refer 
to Junex's press release of August 31, 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the Galt 
project, Junex is one of the largest landholders in Québec, holding 
approximately one million gross acres in the St. Lawrence lowlands 
prospective for Utica shale gas. <span class="companylink">Netherland Sewell &amp; Associates Inc</span>.
 estimates (in accordance with NI 51-101 standards of disclosure) as at 
December 31, 2009 that Junex’s lands hold 3.5 TCF of net best estimate 
unrisked prospective resource. Based on its experience developing the 
Utica in Ohio and West Virgina, the New Cuda management team is 
confident in the economic viability of developing the Utica across the 
Junex land base. New Cuda will actively work with local communities to 
gain <b>social acceptance</b> while also promoting the fact that natural
 gas in the lowlands can be developed in compliance with high 
environmental standards and minimal impact on the population of Québec, 
while creating high-quality jobs, and lowering emissions both globally 
and in Québec by displacing higher-emission <b>energy</b> sources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Alberta, Cuda has 
current productive capacity of 900 boe/d and an extensive portfolio of 
exploration opportunities where it estimates that it can drill six 
independent light oil targets by risking $2.5 million of capital (based 
on dry hole cost). In the second half of 2018, New Cuda anticipates 
drilling three exploration wells (100% working interest) which may be 
expanded based on success. Cuda currently holds approximately $3.0 
million in cash and 3.78 million warrants with an exercise price of 
$0.50 per Cuda share (New Cuda equivalent of $0.139 cents pre 
consolidation) which expire June 25, 2018 and if exercised would result 
in $1.9 million in additional cash proceeds to Cuda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outlook</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upon completion of the 
Transactions and the Acquisition Facility, New Cuda is planning to start
 a 15-20 (gross) well drilling program in the second half of 2018 
targeting the Shannon Light Oil pool in the Powder River Basin. The 2018
 capital program is expected to primarily consist of its high graded, 
high efficiency, Shannon inventory where it can achieve paybacks of 
approximately 8 months based on current strip pricing and a modest 
southern Alberta exploration program targeting high impact light oil 
projects. New Cuda anticipates achieving 2018 exit production of 2,000 
boe/d (60% oil and liquids). New Cuda will continue to advance Junex’s 
portfolio of oil and gas projects in preparation for ongoing improvement
 of the oil and gas industry in Québec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Acquisition Facility</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In connection with the 
Transactions, Cuda has entered into an agreement, with an arm’s-length 
party, with respect to a $35.0 million acquisition facility agreement 
(the "Acquisition Facility") with a Canadian institutional lender (the 
"Lender"). Under the terms of the Acquisition Facility, interest will 
accrue monthly on the outstanding balance of the Acquisition Facility at
 a rate of 10.5% per annum and shall be payable monthly. The Acquisition
 Facility is payable on demand and will mature 12 months from closing of
 the Transaction and Cuda may re-pay the Acquisition Facility in whole 
or in part and all accrued interest at any time prior with 90 days 
notice (the "Pre-Payment Date"). The Acquisition Facility will have 
first ranking security over the assets of the New Cuda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proceeds of the Acquisition Facility will be used to fund the Asset Acquisition and for general working capital purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arrangement Warrant Terms</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each whole arrangement 
warrant will entitle the holder thereof to purchase one New Cuda share 
at a price of $0.40 per share ($4.00 post consolidation) for a period of
 24 months following the completion of the Arrangement. The arrangement 
warrants will vest upon the earlier of (i) the date on which the New 
Cuda shares achieve a 20-day weighted average price of $0.64 per share 
($6.40 post consolidation) and (ii) the date on which New Cuda completes
 an equity financing of a minimum of $10 million at price of at least 
$0.60 per share ($6.00 post consolidation).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recommendations of the Boards of Directors and Shareholder Support Agreements</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The board of directors of
 each of Cuda and Junex have unanimously approved the Arrangement, 
determined that the Arrangement is in the best interests of each of 
Cuda, Junex and their respective shareholders and have unanimously 
determined to recommend that holders of Cuda Shares and Junex Shares, 
respectively, vote their shares in favour of the Arrangement. 
Shareholders of Cuda holding in the aggregate in excess of 72% of the

the aggregate approximately 14.24% of the issued and outstanding Junex 
Shares, including all of the directors and officers and certain other 
shareholders, have agreed to vote their shares in favour of the 
Arrangement (excluding the holders of an additional approximately 25% 
who have provided verbal support as mentioned previously).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, an 
institution which currently holds $1.0 million face value convertible 
debentures of Junex has agreed to convert its convertible debenture into
 approximately 2.7 million pre consolidation common shares (0.27 million
 post consolidation common shares) of New Cuda in connection with the 
Transactions, the whole at a price of $0.372 per pre consolidation 
common share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conditions and Shareholder Meetings</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Completion of the 
Arrangement remains subject to satisfaction of certain conditions

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This news release 
contains forward-looking statements. All statements other than 
statements of historical fact included in this release, are 
forward-looking statements that involve various risks and uncertainties 
and are based on forecasts of future operational or financial results, 
estimates of amounts not yet determinable and assumptions of management.
 In particular, forward-looking information included in this release 
includes (i) assumptions and expectations with regard to the 
Transactions and their completion and the anticipated benefits and 
advantages of the Transactions; (ii) the future prospects, including 
exploration potential, resulting from the Transactions and the ability 
to unlock value, (iii) production estimates and production growth rates,
 which assume accuracy of technical and geological information and 
analysis and may be impacted by unscheduled maintenance, labour and 
contractor availability; (iv) capital expenditures and other cash costs,
 which assume foreign exchange rates and accuracy of production 
estimates, and may be impacted by unexpected maintenance, the need to 
hire external resources and accelerated capital plans; (v) profits and 
free cash flow, which assume production and expenditure estimates and 
may be impacted by <b>energy</b> prices, production estimates, and the 
timing of payments, (vi) reserves and resources which are 
forward-looking statements by their nature involving implied assessment,
 and may be impacted by <b>energy</b> prices, future drilling results 
and operating costs and (vii) predictions as to the impact of gas 
extraction in the St. Lawrence lowlands. Risk factors that could prevent
 such forward-looking statements from being realized include ongoing 
permitting requirements and the ability to work with local populations 
and governments, the actual results of current exploration activities, 
market conditions, the availability and nature of alternative sources of
 <b>energy</b>, conclusions of economic evaluations and changes in 
project parameters as plans continue to be refined as well as future 
prices of <b>energy</b>. Although Junex and Cuda have attempted to 
identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ 
materially, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as 
anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that such 
statements will prove to be accurate as actual results and future events
 could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. 
Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking 
statements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The term 
original-oil-in-place ("OOIP") is equivalent to total petroleum 
initially-in-place ("TPIIP"). TPIIP, as defined in the Canadian Oil and 
Gas Evaluation Handbook, is that quantity of petroleum that is estimated
 to exist in naturally occurring accumulations. It includes that 
quantity of petroleum that is estimated, as of a given date, to be 
contained in known accumulations, prior to production, plus those 
estimated quantities in accumulations yet to be discovered. A portion of
 the TPIIP is considered undiscovered and there is no certainty that any
 portion of such undiscovered resources will be discovered. With respect
 to the portion of the TPIIP that is considered discovered resources, 
there is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any
 portion of such discovered resources. A significant portion of the 
estimated volumes of TPIIP will never be recovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovered Petroleum 
Initially In Place is that quantity of petroleum that is estimated, as 
of a given date, to be contained in known accumulations prior to 
production. The recoverable portion of discovered petroleum initially in
 place includes production, reserves, and contingent resources; the 
remainder is unrecoverable. There is uncertainty that it will be 
commercially viable to produce any portion of the resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective Resources are
 those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application 
of future development projects. Prospective resources have both an 
associated chance of discovery and a chance of development. Not all 
exploration projects will result in discoveries. The chance that an 
exploration project will result in the discovery of petroleum is 
referred to as the chance of discovery. Thus, for an undiscovered 
accumulation the chance of commerciality is the product of two risk 
components-the chance of discovery and the chance of development. There 
is no certainty that any portion of the Prospective Resources will be 
discovered. If discovered, there is no certainty that it will be 
commercially viable to produce any portion of the Prospective Resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Junex’s Utica shale gas 
net best estimate unrisked prospective resource is located in the St. 
Lawrence Lowlands, where several wells have been drilled by industry 
establishing the existence of a large gas resource. While the Utica has 
been successfully developed in the United States and encouraging 
exploration wells have tested at encouraging rates in Québec, to date 
there has been no commercial projects developed in Québec. To reach the 
commercialization phase, New Cuda will work with Québec stakeholders to 
propose a project that will favour <b>social acceptance</b> notably by 
minimizing disturbance of surface lands, avoiding development proximal 
to urban centers and perform fracture stimulation in the shale in a 
manner that is respectful of the environment and the local population. 
Key risks to the development of Junex’s lowlands assets include the 
receipt of regulatory approval and <b>social acceptance</b>, 
implementation of rules that allow for fracking in Québec, construction 
of infrastructure to transport natural gas to markets, access to capital
 in order to capitalize a capital intensive development plan, access to 
services required for development, and further derisking of the 
technical risks associated with developing unconventional reservoirs. 
The total costs and timelines associated with establishing the 
commerciality of this project are unknown at this time given the early 
stage of the project’s development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Natural gas volumes have 
been converted to a boe using six thousand cubic feet equal to one 
barrel unless otherwise stated. A boe conversion ratio of 6:1 is based 
upon an <b>energy</b> equivalency conversion method primarily applicable
 at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the 
wellhead. This conversion conforms to NI 51-101. Boe may be misleading, 
particularly if used in isolation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil and Gas Metrics</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This news release 
contains metrics commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry, such
 as "operating netback", "funds flow netback" and "reserve life index" 
("<span class="companylink">RLI</span>"). These terms do not have a 
standardized meaning and the calculation of such metrics set forth 
herein may not be comparable to the calculation method used or presented
 by other companies for the same or similar metrics, and therefore 
should not be used to make such comparisons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Operating netback" equals total petroleum and natural gas sales less royalties and operating costs calculated on a boe basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Funds flow netback" 
starts with the operating netback and deducts general and administrative
 costs, interest expense and then adds or deducts any realized gains or 
losses on derivative contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Reserve life index" is calculated as total company interest reserves divided by annual production, for the year indicated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Test Results and Initial Production Rates</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any references in this 
news release to production test, initial production and other short-term
 production rates are useful in confirming the presence of hydrocarbons;
 however, such rates are not determinative of the rates at which such 
wells will continue to produce and decline thereafter and are not 
indicative of the long-term performance or the ultimate recovery of such
 wells. In addition, such rates may also include recovered "load oil" or
 "load water" fluids used in well completion stimulation. While 
encouraging, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such 
rates in calculating the aggregate production. Such rates are based on 
field estimates and may be based on limited data available at this time.
 A pressure transient analysis or well-test interpretation has not been 
carried out in respect of any of the wells. Accordingly, readers are 
cautions that the test results should be considered to be preliminary.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4 stars</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For anyone trying to 
navigate the labyrinth of personalities and events behind the ongoing 
investigation into Russian interference in the last U.S. presidential 
election, this film is a comprehensive and indispensable primer. It's 
also riveting and authoritative, quoting impeccable sources in the 
intelligence and diplomatic community, as well as well-known faces like 
Hillary Clinton and Senator John McCain, showing the Russians' long 
history of subverting rival nations and how it pulled off its biggest 
coup to date, installing Donald Trump as president. (Directed by Jack 
Bryan.) Bruce DeMara</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ANOTE'S ARK</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3.5 stars</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You've probably never 
heard of Kiribati, but it's one of a number of Pacific island nations 
facing imminent submersion and destruction as a result of global 
warming. Unusual climate events are already causing more than occasional
 flooding. Fortunately the islanders have an eloquent and impassioned 
champion in President Anote Tong, who travels the world beseeching and 
seeking help from other nations. Yet the film's waning moments suggest 
that hope for this paradise may be lost. (Directed by Matthieu Rytz.) BD</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE ARTIST AND THE PERVERT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3 stars</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Georg Friedrich Haas is 
the world's most performed living composer, an Austrian whose parents 
were Nazi sympathizers. Mollena Williams is a well-known kink educator 
who grew up in Harlem and Haas's artistic “muse.” She wears a collar 
that defines their master/slave relationship — and what an unexpectedly 
tender one it is, marked by collaboration and deep emotional bonds that 
go beyond bondage. The film, directed by Beatrice Behn and René 
Gebhardt, is surprisingly sweet and instructive (and occasionally 
naughty). BD</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE CLEANERS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3.5 stars</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a world where more 
than 3 billion people are connecting through social media websites, this
 riveting documentary takes a peak behind the <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>
 curtain to reveal the content moderators, “cleaners” who have the 
Sisyphean task of keeping nudity, child exploitation, hate and other 
dreck off the internet. For the beleaguered workers in Manila, it's a 
job that comes with impossible demands in workload and expectations that
 leave deep psychological scars. Equal parts fascinating and 
frightening. (Directed by Hans Block and Moritz Riesewieck.) BD</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">COMMANDER ARIAN</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3.5 stars</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">History has not been kind
 to the Kurds, a people without a country in a troubled region of the 
world. But they're a tenacious lot as personified by Arian, the leader 
of a female fighting unit battling Islamic terrorists in war-torn Syria.
 The film follows Arian before and after she suffers five gunshot 
wounds. It takes us to the front lines of battle and shows us the 
comaraderie of courageous women like Arian, who wages a parallel fight 
to instil a sense of worth in her fellow soldiers. Inspirational in all 
the right ways. (Directed by Alba Sotorra.) BD</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DIXIE CHICKS: SHUT UP AND SING</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3.5 stars</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Dixie Chicks singer 
Natalie Maines told a London concert audience in 2003 she was “ashamed” 
of then U.S.-president George W. Bush, she and her country music trio 
became the object of right-wing hatred across America. But there's no 
better way than adversity to test a person's mettle, and one of the many
 remarkable things about this documentary is watching the band evolve 
both personally and musically. Co-directors Barbara Kopple and Cecilia 
Peck originally released this doc in 2006, but not much has changed if 
you consider the people and prejudices behind the rise of current U.S. 
President Donald Trump. Peter Howell</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE GAME CHANGERS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3 stars</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a vegan diet is good 
enough for Olympians, ultra-marathoners, ancient Roman gladiators and 
Arnold Schwarzenegger, then shouldn't the rest of us be eating it, too? 
So goes the argument of James Wilks, a former MMA fighter turned elite 
military trainer who practises and preaches the no-meat credo with the 
enthusiasm of an infomercial pitchman. But he's persuasive, marshalling 
scientific data and athletic testimonials that strongly suggests carrots
 are better than carne if you want to up your <b>energy</b> and cut your
 risk of heart disease and cancer. If that's not enough to persuade men 
to get their hands off their burgers, a urologist pops up to clinically 
prove that vegetarians achieve better erections than meat lovers. 
(Directed by Louis Psihoyos.) PH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HEAT: A KITCHEN (R)EVOLUTION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3.5 stars</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world's top chefs, 
invariably men, have long had a reputation for being “equal opportunity 
a-holes.” Thankfully, Toronto filmmaker Maya Gallus shows us a slew of 
top women chefs locally, and in the U.S. and Europe who break the mould 
in so many ways, among them the U.K.'s Angela Hartnett, a protégé of 
Hell's Kitchen hothead Gordon Ramsay. The film gives us women who are 
intelligent, articulate, hard-working while offering interesting 
insights into how they run their kitchens in a distinctly female way. BD</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAILA AT THE BRIDGE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3 stars</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With 90 per cent of the 
world's opium production, it's small wonder Afghanistan has a serious 
drug addiction crisis. Among the few trying to help is Laila, a 
courageous woman who works with her former addict brother against all 
odds, including an indifferent patriarchal government (this is, after 
all, Afghanistan). But watch the tight smiles of squirming government 
officials when the cameras are on. The ugliness and squalor of the 
addicts — especially those under the bridge of the title — bring the 
harsh reality home. (Directed by Elissa Sylvia Mirzaei and Gulistan 
Mirzaei.) BD</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOVE, SCOTT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3 stars</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The film is a sensitive 
and engaging exploration of the aftermath of the homophobic attack on 
Scott Jones, a talented young musician in small-town New Glasgow, Nova 
Scotia, that left him a paraplegic. The community rallies and confronts 
its own homophobia as the likeable and thoughtful Jones struggles to 
come to terms with his future — and his fear of ever being alone — as he
 seeks to find forgiveness for his attacker. A particularly bitter pill 
to swallow: that the attack was not prosecuted as a hate crime. 
(Directed by Laura Marie Wayne.) BD</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MANUFACTURED LANDSCAPES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4 stars</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What begins as a portrait
 of Canadian landscape photographer Edward Burtynsky turns into an 
astonishing visual indictment of man's inhumanity to Mother Earth, as 
seen through the documentary prism of Jennifer Baichwal. There's strange
 and symmetrical beauty in the scenes of environmental abuse caused by 
factories in China and Bangladesh. The opening tracking shot by 
cinematographer Peter Mettler through a never-ending factory qualifies 
as one of the modern era's most startling movie moments. Twelve years 
after its initial release, it remains a classic film by a Canadian 
documentary master. PH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NETIZENS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3 stars</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through the compelling 
stories of three American women, the film makes a solid case that the 
Digital Age has merely provided misogynist men another sick and 
effective way to victimize women. Director Cynthia Lowen demonstrates 
just how onerous and painful it is for women to fight back against their
 victimizers but offers some hope in the courage and determination of 
activists and individuals. It's a timely film that ought to summon 
everyone's outrage. BD</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OUR NEW PRESIDENT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3.5 stars</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fake news with a shot of 
vodka. Maxim Pozdorovkin's sobering doc shows how avidly — and 
effectively — Russia's state-run new agencies used hacking and trolling 
tactics to promote Donald Trump while demonizing his rival Hillary 
Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The doc alternately 
amuses, shocks and enrages, revealing concerted Russian propaganda 
efforts, backed by Vladimir Putin's state-controlled media, that range 
from the comically paranoid to the scarily sophisticated. This film has 
become even more urgent in the months since its Sundance premiere, as it
 becomes ever more apparent that Russian collusion helped propel Trump 
to his unlikely electoral victory. It's all fun and games until somebody
 loses a democracy. PH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PLAYING HARD</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2.5 stars</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This film charts the development of the <span class="companylink">Ubisoft</span>
 videogame For Honor from its inception to launch. Following a few 
members of the leadership team, it heavily focuses on creative director 
Jason VandenBerghe, who wanted to make this sword-based fighting game 
for over a decade, and there is good stuff about a driven artist 
realizing his dream. It is even better on the too few occasions it shows
 the nitty gritty and personal cost of game development. (Directed by 
Jean-Simon Chartier.) Raju Mudhar</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUEERCORE: HOW TO PUNK A REVOLUTION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3 stars</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Way back before social 
media, a group of queer activists cannily created their own “scene” by 
pretending it already existed. This documentary goes beyond cultural 
anthropology, exploring how queer activism briefly allied itself to the 
punk movement before becoming its own movement with the gay liberation 
movement, rejecting (like punk) all the conventions that growing <b>social acceptance</b>
 entailed. Filmmakers Bruce LaBruce and John Waters and others provide 
lively and subversive commentary. (Directed by Yony Leyser.) BD</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ROLL RED ROLL</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4 stars</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When star members of a 
high school football team gang-rape an unconscious teen girl, coaches 
and school officials in Steubenville, Ohio, fall all over themselves to 
downplay the horrific event — until a whistle-blowing blogger unearths 
and posts online clues to the crime and tells the world about the 
churchgoing town's hypocrisy. Nancy Schwartzman's devastating real-life 
thriller documents a shocking sexual assault in a tight-knit community, 
and the role of social media in compounding the felony but also helping 
to solve it. PH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RUNNING FROM CRAZY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3 stars</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mariel Hemingway grew up 
in the gigantic shadow of a legendary grandfather, novelist Ernest 
Hemingway. But it comes with loads of baggage, including a family 
history of mental illness, addiction and suicide. Archival footage 
supplements the story of Hemingway and her two older sisters, and the 
toll the Hemingway legacy has exacted upon them. One shocking revelation
 further darkens the picture. While the film feels a little 
self-indulgent at times, Hemingway proves to be a worthy protagonist. 
(Directed by Barbara Kopple.) BD</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SILK AND THE FLAME</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3 stars</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the largest 
annual migration on Earth, Yao returns home every year for the Lunar New
 Year celebration to visit his family and face the inevitable questions 
from his dying father, relatives and neighbours: why isn't he married? 
Shot in black and white, it's an intimate look at family life in a 
traditional culture, featuring a kind and decent man approaching middle

downplay the horrific event - until a whistle-blowing blogger unearths

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world's top chefs, 
invariably men, have long had a reputation for being "equal opportunity

top female chefs locally, in the U.S. and Europe, who break the mould in
 so many ways, among them the U.K.'s Victoria Blumley, a protege of 
Hell's Kitchen hothead Gordon Ramsay. The film gives us women who are

Unusual climate events are already causing more than occasional

drug addiction crisis. Among the few trying to help is Laila, a 
courageous woman who works with her former addict brother against all 
odds, including an indifferent patriarchal government (this is, after 
all, Afghanistan). But watch the tight smiles of squirming government

 riveting documentary takes a peek behind the <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>
 curtain to reveal the content moderators, "cleaners" who have the 
Sisyphean task of keeping nudity, child exploitation, hate and other 
dreck off the internet. For the beleaguered workers in Manila, it's a

just how onerous and painful it is for women to fight back against their
 victimizers but offers some hope in the courage and determination of

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The film is a sensitive 
and engaging exploration of the aftermath of the homophobic attack on 
Scott Jones, a talented young musician in small-town New Glasgow, Nova 
Scotia, that left him a paraplegic. The community rallies and confronts 
its own homophobia, as the likeable and thoughtful Jones struggles to 
come to terms with his future - and his fear of ever being alone - as he
 seeks to find forgiveness for his attacker. A particularly bitter pill 
to swallow: that the attack was not prosecuted as a hate crime.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fake news with a shot of

effectively - Russia's state-run new agencies used hacking and trolling 
tactics to promote Donald Trump while demonizing his rival Hillary 
Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The doc alternately 
amuses, shocks and enrages, revealing concerted Russian propaganda 
efforts, backed by Vladimir Putin's state-controlled media, that range 
from the comically paranoid to the scarily sophisticated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This film has become even
 more urgent in the months since its Sundance premiere, as it becomes

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also riveting and 
authoritative, quoting impeccable sources in the intelligence and

 installing Donald Trump as president. (Directed by Jack Bryan.)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mariel Hemingway grew up 
in the gigantic shadow of a legendary grandfather, novelist Ernest 
Hemingway. But it comes with loads of baggage, including a family 
history of mental illness, addiction and suicide. Archival footage 
supplements the story of Hemingway and her sisters, and the toll the 
Hemingway legacy has exacted upon them. A shocking revelation further 
darkens the picture. While the film feels a little self-indulgent at 
times, Hemingway proves to be a worthy protagonist. (Directed by Barbara

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The film follows Arian 
before and after she suffers five gunshot wounds. It takes us to the

 fellow soldiers. Inspirational in all the right ways.</p>

factories in China and Bangladesh. The opening tracking shot by 
cinematographer Peter Mettler through a never-ending factory qualifies 
as one of the modern era's most startling movie moments. Twelve years

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ignace is one of five 
locations still under consideration from the more than 20 communities

potential sites due to unsuitable geology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need to find a

NWMO delegation will also visit the other four potential candidate 
locations at Hornepayne, Manitouwadge, Huron-Kinless and South Bruce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dolcetti noted that NWMO 
has worked with Ignace town council since 2010 and the Wabigoon First 
Nation band council has been actively involved in learning more about 
the project for the past several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previously, Ignace was involved in a similar initiative undertaken by <span class="companylink">Atomic <b>Energy</b> Canada</span> during the 1990s, which did not result in the identification of a preferred location due to "<b>social acceptance</b>" issues at the time associated with the long term containment/disposal of nuclear waste.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Dolcetti, NWMO is addressing these concerns through its Learn More Program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The more information 
people get, the better positioned they are to make a judgement based on 
the facts," he said. "Collaboration is required with the communities and
 people involved and we're grateful for the work that has already 
occurred."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ignace has been proactive
 in its pursuit of the project with a study underway at a prospective 
location located about 35 km west of the town and south of Highway 17. 
An initial bore hole drilling program was completed in January, the core
 samples are currently being studied with two more bore holes planned 
for the same area during 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic benefits to

<span class="companylink">QUESTOR TECHNOLOGY INC</span>. ANNOUNCES $4.5 MM INCINERATOR SALES ORDER FOR COLORADO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questor Technology Inc</span>. has received a $4.5-million sales order for hybrid incinerators to be delivered in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past four years, 
Questor has been providing rental incineration to this market for a 
variety of clients. While Questor continues to provide rental 
incineration solutions to its Colorado client base this order is 
important in that the hybrid solution continues to be sought after for 
permanent production operations. In addition to new facilities many 
producers are reviewing the company's technology for replacement of 
existing combustion solutions for its established facilities. Questor's 
patented and proprietary technology has evolved to address Colorado's 
unique and highly demanding requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With stringent regulations imposed by the <span class="companylink">United States Environmental Protection Agency</span>
 that requires performance testing for incinerators and other stacks 
that burn waste gas it is expected that the demand for better equipment 
will increase. Each state may have additional requirements that reflect 
unique and specific needs that extend beyond the <span class="companylink">EPA</span>'s requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The State of Colorado has
 taken a lead role in regulating quality, high performance emission 
control equipment and industry in this area and is now including 
Questor's style of combustion devices in their planning for wellbore 
flow back periods and their production life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With clear requirements 
and expectations, from both the federal and state agencies, industry can
 now select equipment that serves their specific needs, including 
regulatory compliance, <b>social acceptance</b>, operating performance, reliability and technical support.</p>

Forum hosted by The Northern Miner in Toronto in October, we present an 
edited transcript of a roundtable discussion between six mining industry
 veterans on the topic of innovation in mine development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The roundtable participants were: Subo Chatterjee, vice-president of consulting and business transformation leader at <span class="companylink">PwC Canada</span>; Ewan Downie, president and CEO of <span class="companylink">Premier Gold Mines</span>
 (TSX: PG; US-OTC: PIRGF); Matt Manson, president and CEO of Stornoway

Stothart, executive vice-president and chief operating officer of

Cumming served as moderator.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: Let’s begin with Gord. Over your 30-year career in mining, what changes have you seen in mine development?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gordon Stothart: A lot of it comes from automating physical tasks on the
 engineering side — taking away the physical side. I’m enough of a 
dinosaur that I did dump designs and road designs with French curves and
 compasses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mechanical piece of 
design has changed drastically. The equipment certainly is starting to 
change, but it takes a long time. I saw my first movie on automated 
trucks in 1984 and we’re still trying to get automated trucks into 
open-pit mines. So it doesn’t always move quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot of the change occurs in the communication and economic theories that we can apply to the mines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at the end of the day, we still blow it up and move it to produce metal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: Matt, could you 
compare building Diavik and those other diamond mines in the Territories
 two decades ago with Stornoway’s recent experience building the Renard 
diamond mine in Quebec?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Matt Manson: I’d echo the sentiment of Gord in that mine development 
over the past 20 years hasn’t changed as much as you think it might. The
 big difference between building Diavik and building Renard was the 
management of it: Diavik was EPCM and Stornoway was self-managed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have to remember that 
mining is a non-innovative business because it’s capital intensive. We 
raise all the money upfront to build these mines and we try hard not to 
screw it up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The people who are giving you the money to do that are inherently risk-averse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Renard, we’re bringing
 in waste-ore sorting, and that’s an innovation that is quite current 
and topical. We’re doing that because we have a specific issue in our 
process plant that we’re addressing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It looks great, as we’re 
doing all the data. It’s going to work and it’s modestly priced, and 
there’s a great fallback position if we don’t get the results we want.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s a no-brainer to do it, but when I talk to investors, the first question I get is: “What other company does that?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you get that kind of
 a question from an investor, that is the risk aversion of the mining 
and financing community against innovation. That holds us back, for 
sure.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: Turning to John, <span class="companylink">Goldcorp</span> is quite aggressive in describing the changing future of <b>energy</b>
 in mining and the company has planned its Borden gold mine in Ontario 
to be an all-electric mine when it is built. Could you describe <span class="companylink">Goldcorp</span>’s overall concept of <b>energy</b> use going forward and Borden as a case study?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Mallally: I don’t think we’re immune to what Matt was mentioning in terms of the capital raised and the sunk capital, and <span class="companylink">Probe Mines</span> (the previous owner of Borden before its acquisition by <span class="companylink">Goldcorp</span>) was already $400 million along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Borden was really seen as a greenfield project and an opportunity to take a new look and have a clean slate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From my perspective on 
some of the risks and challenges, we’re starting to see them addressed 
now. We’re nearing the end of advanced exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other issues revolve 
around social acceptability and attracting top talent, as well. Turning 
the page in terms of the reputation of the mining industry has been 
interesting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulators — you might be
 surprised — are really excited about these new technologies, as there 
are implications when it comes to operating electric vehicles in the 
underground mine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We’ve seen a lot of 
original equipment manufacturers and vendors and other partners coming 
on, including First Nations communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We were faced with those same significant challenges, in particular the capital raised and the risk aversion because of that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we’ve taken these 
strides and are halfway through. We haven’t entirely proven out the 
concept of an all-battery electric vehicle mine, but are enough along to
 start to point the way to some of the benefits. It’s been an 
interesting journey so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In terms of results, there’s work to be done, but we’re starting to see some of the payoff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: Subo, your specialty
 is advising on procurement and supply chain management. Could you give 
us your latest insights on these topics in relation to mine development,
 and what is PwC’s “Procurement 4.0” system?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subo Chatterjee: When we talk about innovation … that has sort of been the trend or messaging from 2014 all the way to 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We recently did a survey 
of companies globally — including 2,200 mining companies — and asked 
questions about their adoption rates for new technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What we noticed was that 
9% of companies had adopted a long-term strategy for innovation. And at 
the other end of the spectrum, 20% of companies were more opportunistic,
 with no long-term vision and only going after a few areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We took a step back to look at what investment really was happening and put them into four clusters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first was around automation and robotics, and that was where the biggest investment was happening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second was what we 
call the digitally enabled workforce. How do you empower your employees 
to drive forward more productively?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third was around 
integrated enterprises. With all the data you’ve created, how does it 
feed back into your systems? Do you have integration between your field 
workers and your corporate data centres?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fourth is about advanced analytics, which links to our conversations earlier today on big data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What we noticed is that 
it was the first two areas where we saw investment and focus, while the 
last two areas is where there wasn’t a whole lot of focus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other aspect was the 
investment by the mining industry in innovation versus other industries.
 Certainly the trend since 2014 is more research and development 
(R&amp;D) in mining compared to other industries on a relative basis but
 not an absolute one. The trend is upward, but there’s some catching up 
to do.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: Ewan, asking you a 
similar question posed to Gord and Matt, comparing today to your Wolfden
 days, are you running Premier any differently from an innovation 
perspective?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ewan Downie: Not really. 
As a new producer we actually view the future of our mines being 
exploration, so there’s a big exploration focus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the innovations 
I’ve seen since I’ve been in this industry are the automation 
underground. That’s pretty important for safety. Underground mines 
aren’t the safest places to be working.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance at our 
Mercedes mine, years ago going underground with the guys driving the 
scoops, if there was a groundfall they would be covered, [but now] at 
Mercedes, the trucks sit tens of metres away from the operator working. I
 think it’s pretty important to see that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of <span class="companylink">Goldcorp</span>’s work at the Musselwhite mine in remote northern Ontario is actually done with employees working from pods in Thunder Bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The automation of machinery in mining has been really impressive over the last decade or so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In running our company, 
it’s changing our people that has been one of the biggest challenges. To
 facilitate being an explorer with almost all geologists to being mainly
 mining engineers has been a big change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: Following up on 
autonomous machinery and remote operations, Walt, could you give us a 
rundown on the state of the art in these areas?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walter Siggelkow: The 
equipment that actually runs at Musselwhite is our equipment. The guys 
at surface run the machines underground and now they run it out of the 
Thunder Bay office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking at the long-term,
 what does that give the people that work in the mines? Well if you take
 a person out of the underground, they’re safer. It is a very harsh 
environment underground. We have to work there but if we can get the 
guys out, then don’t put them underground to start with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you take and you 
move some operations — not all — to a major centre, now you have your 
workers who can go home at night and spend their time with their 
families, changing the typical culture of living in a camp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These sorts of 
technologies are really moving ahead, and they’re available for many 
companies around the world. There are big players and there are smaller 
players like ourselves who specialize in retro-fitting equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I always say to my people
 as we work on a project that there are a lot of discussions these days 
about capital. Our job, first of all, is that I want to get some money 
from the mine. Our job as a supplier is to sell to you guys, but I need 
to make you guys money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So that’s the first thing we have to look at. Do we add to the bottom line? How do we put black on that balance sheet?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[caption id="attachment_1003793769" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Ready to dump ore at <span class="companylink">Iamgold</span>'s Rosebel gold mine in Suriname. Photo by John Cumming.[/caption]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: How do you foster an “innovation culture” in a mining company? I saw an example of that culture take root at <span class="companylink">Iamgold</span>’s
 mine in Suriname with Gord last month where there was an existing 
workforce that became far more productive. How much is it about getting 
the right people, and how much is it a matter of training?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gordon Stothart: Carrying forward with your comments on what we were 
able to do in Suriname at our Rosebel mine, it was a case of “necessity 
was the mother of invention.” That place was closing quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenge was 
obvious, and the team that really took that challenge by the teeth 
brought in whatever they could to the table to point it in the right 
direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What’s quite interesting 
is that you’d think you’d get cost-cutting fatigue or 
product-improvement fatigue after going at this pretty hard for a few 
years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But actually every 
success energized us a little bit more, and a little bit more. That’s a 
piece of it — necessity — but another piece of it is just some vision. 
And it’s not necessarily executives providing that vision, but asking 
for the local managers and workforce to provide their own vision and 
working with them to crystallize that and take it forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You have to think about 
where you want to be. Our mines are changing from short-life mines to 
longer-life ones. I don’t want to be in a meeting 15 years from now — if
 they still let me hang around and do that — and looking at what today 
is current technology, and saying: “This is the way we do things and 
this is the way we’ve always done things.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can’t allow that to happen. You have to get involved with the teams in creating a vision to move it forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: Matt, you built up a mine workforce from almost zero at Renard. Your thoughts?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Matt Manson: If you look at our business, all the things that were 
innovative were problem-solving. We were the first mine in Canada to use
 liquid natural gas (LNG) for power, because we were sufficiently remote
 that we didn’t have a power line and it’s expensive to bring one in, 
but we’re not so remote that we don’t have a road. There’s a 
liquefaction terminal in Montreal so we can have trucks going up and 
down every day. We have Caterpillar LNG gen sets rather than <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> diesel gen sets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That solved an 
infrastructure problem, and everybody in our stakeholder group was quite
 happy to see that happen, and it reduced our greenhouse gas emissions. 
But it wasn’t done for efficiency or cost reasons, it was done for 
problem-solving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s important to have a 
motivated team, because it’s often a bottom-up thing, innovation in 
mining. That wasn’t my idea to do LNG, that was a bunch of engineers who
 came up with a clever idea knowing there was a gas terminal in 
Montreal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it’s bottom-up and a freedom to come up with clever ideas and some endorsement, and support for that.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: How do you reward 
great ideas from your workforce? Do they get a cut of the money savings?
 What is the incentive to innovate from the individual worker’s 
perspective?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Matt Manson: We bonus people at bonus time because we value clever ideas and we want to reflect that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subo Chatterjee: I want 
to build on that point. One of our clients last year was struggling with
 knowledge retention because their retirement rate is pretty high. You 
have to then ask what are the age groups and what is the impact over the
 next 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We noticed that 40% of 
the Canadian workforce are the baby boomers. The retirement rate will 
double in the next 10 years for most companies. And 35% is Gen Y, which 
is 35 years old and less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the challenge is that 
you have two ends of the spectrum: the baby boomers have all the 
operational knowledge, and the younger generation has the technology 
side of things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most companies, your 
challenge is going to be that as you have innovation coming in, your 
adoption rate for your experienced staff is going to be lower than for 
the younger ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How do you have the younger people train the baby boomers with the new technology while retaining your operational knowledge?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of our clients has 
adopted “cross-learning,” where they have younger people training older 
people on teleremote operations, while learning about day-to-day 
operations from the older people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other aspect is the 
pace of technological change. What’s true today may not even exist 10 
years from now. Training people on a specific technology may not be the 
solution — it’s more about what we call “digital IQ.” Are you instilling
 the values of innovation and reacting to change every couple of years?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Mullally: I was 
thinking about the top-down approach, and our management has a pretty 
simple approach to innovation, and the first part is just: “Let’s do 
it.” The other part is challenging others. We have the history of the 
Goldcorp Challenge in 2000, and more recently we have started the 
Disrupt Mining event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there’s the partnering aspect. Sitting next to Walter here, and meeting other suppliers today, we know what <span class="companylink">Goldcorp</span>
 can do and set out that vision, but we know there are a lot of other 
actors in that space. We need to know what we’re good at and find others
 to collaborate with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: Starting at the 
’Miner 21 years ago, one of the first innovation stories I wrote was 
about Noranda and its Magnola project in Asbestos, Que., where a 
Noranda-led consortium was going to take asbestos tailings and make 
magnesium metal from the tailings. They spent a billion dollars on it, 
and they were using hydrofluoric acid, which ate through everything. It 
worked beautifully at the bench scale, but when they scaled it up to a 
commercial level, it was a total failure and almost wrecked the company,
 and arguably prevented Noranda from becoming a super-major like a BHP 
or <span class="companylink">Rio Tinto</span>. Now it’s a shell of 
itself — they got rid of their research department in Quebec when Xtrata
 took over. My question is: When do you get too far ahead on the 
innovation curve as a company? What is the sweet spot?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gordon Stothart: We call it the “bleeding edge.” You need to be 
innovative but you need to recognize when you’re going down a rabbit 
hole and pull your head up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You need to have enough 
of a relationship with your shareholders and your board and the people 
who run the company that you can say: “Yeah, you’re going to make some 
mistakes along the way.” Not necessarily disastrous mistakes, but it’s 
risk versus reward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are you risking the whole
 company on an innovative idea? If you’re going down that road, you’re 
spending a lot of time thinking before you start doing, because it 
starts to get really expensive once you start doing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: Let’s take questions
 from the floor and online viewers. Alistair asks: “Should mining 
companies be obligated to contribute to a common R&amp;D organization to
 advance mining technology?” We do have talk these days of encouraging 
“innovation clusters” across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Mullally: I don’t 
know about “obligated,” but going back to partnering: we need to 
understand where the sweet spot is for companies, and where there may be
 a broader group, a bigger community that may be able to add a lot of 
value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plus, there is the aspect
 of not necessarily competing on every aspect of the business. Do we 
need to compete on battery electric vehicles, for example, when there 
are so many health and safety aspects when you’re able to remove diesel 
from the underground environment and improve the operating conditions?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do we need to be 
competing on tailings management? Tailings management could be 
outsourced and taken away from every operator. To me, if we had one 
consortium that was looking at ways of doing that — sort of a service 
model — why wouldn’t that be a good thing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walter Siggelkow: 
Innovation is driven by need, and you can’t force people to pay for 
something they don’t want. They need to need it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a supplier, I’d prefer
 to leave my money in my hands, and I’ll go out and build stuff, and if I
 build a good thing, I’ll go out and sell it to people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There shouldn’t be an 
obligation to force mining companies to pay more taxes — which is what 
this really would be — to give to what someone decides is a good 
opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We make our own opportunities, and if it’s a good product, you guys will buy it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ewan Downie: Competition 
is good, too. If there is a common organization and they have a monopoly
 on that technology, it will probably drive the cost up. And as a mining
 company, you’re always looking at ways to bring costs down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So that would be a bit of a mistake and a lot of the innovation comes from different groups with different ideas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[caption id="attachment_1003791605" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Tele-remote operators working at <span class="companylink">Goldcorp</span>’s Red Lake gold mine in Ontario. Credit: Goldcorp.[/caption]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: Another question 
from the crowd: “How would you build less invasive mines?” For example: 
less water usage, lowered noise, less dust, et cetera.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Matt Manson: We have that now. We’re all moving down a path of less 
invasive mining and smaller footprints. Whether that’s a formalized code
 from a regulatory authority that’s uniform or we’re all responding to 
our own regulatory agencies, we’re all trying to behave in a socially 
responsible, conscientious manner. That’s a long-term evolution in our 
business, and that will continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gordon Stothart: We’re trying to bond together and work as an industry 
to come up with solutions. And it’s not just for altruistic, pure 
environmental reasons, or even social reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are plenty of 
economic reasons to have a smaller footprint. You spend all your money 
from day one separating ore from waste until you get that piece of 
metal, and each step is more and more expansive. So the more surgical 
you can be at the start helps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flipside is that as 
metals become scarcer, prices go up and cut-off grades go down, and you 
start to look at larger excavations. There’s a bit of a conundrum at 
work there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: Goldcorp CEO David 
Garofalo speaking at our Canadian Mining Symposium in London last May 
was quite adamant that water use would be the number-one issue in terms 
of <b>social acceptance</b> of a mining project. We see it all the time 
in Latin America where, if agriculture conflicts with mining, 
agriculture usually wins the day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Mullally: Even in 
Ontario, water is one of the primary concerns when you’re trying to 
develop a mine. One of the biggest things that we need to be up to speed
 with is what’s socially acceptable, and what are the alternatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You see development times
 being 15 to 20 years from when a prospect is found to when a mine comes
 into operation. We really need to take a look at how to make that more 
efficient and take those projects through the social acceptability part.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: To Gord’s point 
about the falling cut-off grades over time: What is the practical lower 
limit for cut-off grades for a commercial mine, and what trend are we 
likely to see in the future?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Matt Manson: In this question, we’re not all created equal — and this is
 where everybody has to be a geologist — because some mineral settings 
lend themselves to going into the sub-1-gram-gold material, and some 
deposits are more binary like a volcanogenic massive sulphide deposit or
 a kimberlite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it’s not every sector 
of the mining industry that is able to expand with a lower cut-off into 
the lower-grade material. It’s the gold guys that probably have this 
option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gordon Stothart: At what price of gold? There will be a lower limit for 
any given time space, but into the future, it’s harder to figure out 
where it goes. Innovation and technology will allow you to mine it that 
much more cheaply. Supply and demand will drive the price to wherever it
 goes, depending on the availability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I’m not a geologist, so 
don’t shoot me in the head for this, but as for the “easier deposits” in
 “more comfortable” jurisdictions, we’re now mining those or have 
already mined through them. The next suite of deposits could either be 
more challenging in terms of location, grade or other technical aspects,
 and more challenging from the explorationist side in being able to find
 it. It’s an ongoing march.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes you see these 
incredible technologies appear. When heap leaching in gold mining and 
solvent-extraction electrowinning in the copper business came in, they 
completely changed the whole suite of what was mineable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The counter to that is 
the number of oxide copper deposits in the world is somewhat limited, 
and probably most of them have been discovered now. So as that goes 
away, you have to find something else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Processing really is an 
important piece of the technology. On the pure mining side, you’re going
 to asymptotically approach productivities that are hard to go beyond.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: Another future trend
 in mine development that Barrick Gold president Kelvin Dushnisky and 
David Garofalo both emphasized in our London symposium was the increased
 use of joint ventures in developing mining camps, because today they 
have too much overcapacity in terms of duplicate mills and 
infrastructure and such. What is the future of this kind of partnership 
model?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gordon Stothart: It’s interesting, because our CEO Steve Letwin opened 
the program this morning and he comes from an oil and gas background, 
and it confounds the heck out of him to look at these clusters of mines 
in elephant country and they all get set up as separate little 
self-sufficient operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the oil business you’d
 form a consortium around that, and go for the economies of scale around
 it. It’s not a model that is used very often in the mining business. 
That’s somewhat distinct from joint ventures, but there’s a bit of 
overlap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it’s true of any sort
 of innovation, where we need to intentionally look outside of where 
mining is. When I look at automated trucks, I’m not really interested in
 investing in truck automation any more. With the automation of 
driverless vehicles, there’s a much bigger industry out there that’s 
going to solve all of those problems for us in the next three or four 
years. Why would we invest a cent of that for trucks?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Mullally: Before the
 Chilean project with Teck became NuevoUnion, it was El Morro and it 
went to the Supreme Court in Chile, and we just walked away from the 
project knowing: why would we ever build two tailings facilities, two 
desalination plants and two milling complexes within however many 
kilometres apart from each other?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was really the 
imperative there. You wouldn’t see a Sudbury model where you have two 
different facilities right next door to each other, building the same 
infrastructure and taking up twice the footprint and twice the water. 
Especially on the water front in Chile, with their massive shortages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So that was something we recognized and didn’t even challenge the Supreme Court decision, and walked away at that point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subo Chatterjee: This is a
 trend we’re seeing across industries, and supply chain and warehousing 
is one area where there is potential to have companies collaborate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key question where 
some industries get stuck is that when there is an increased demand and 
there is a shortage of supply, who gets the supply? Because if your 
operations are at risk, how do you have balanced commitment of supply? 
There are also issues of intellectual property and contractual 
obligations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is being 
discussed, and the rail industry is making progress, and oil and gas has
 made progress. We haven’t seen that in mining yet, but these are topics
 of discussion. It is not a trend, at least for the next year or so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: Another question 
from the floor: What do you think is required for changing the mindset 
of mining investors such that unproven technologies are funded and 
embraced?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ewan Downie: I don’t know
 if that’s possible. We’re seeing more passive investors investing in 
our sector rather than active investors, so I don’t think a lot of those
 investors care about what innovations are going on. They buy a basket 
of stocks and whatever happens, happens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gordon Stothart: Some of it goes back to vision. You need to sell the 
vision of why you’re doing it. It’s challenging. In quarterly reports 
and so on, the feedback on innovation is lost a little bit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As an industry, we’ve moved from a model where <span class="companylink">Inco</span> had a research facility, Falconbridge had a research facility and Noranda had one, and so did Cominco, Teck and so on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of those big 
companies have since moved offshore, and all of those facilities have 
gone away. We’re right in the midst of trying to reinvent how we do 
technology as a mining industry in this country. It’s challenging and 
it’s a tough sell for investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Matt Manson: Investors are moving away from being a fund manager that’s 
interested in a specific sector and a specific team, and a specific 
long-term vision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s become a short-term 
vision. It’s exchange-traded funds driven, and has become much more 
passive. For investors, it’s about the next quarterly report. That’s the
 mark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s not how clever and forward-thinking the management team is. Unfortunately, that’s the way it has been going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gordon Stothart: Earlier, we spoke about “needs-driven” so that if the 
demands come from either the technical aspects of the deposit itself or 
the regulatory space, or the social space, where you’re trying to open 
up operations, you just have to get better at it. At some point in time,
 the investor community will follow it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a segment of the
 investor community that is focused on ethical investments and is 
driving in those directions. It will take some learning, but it can get 
there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Mullally: Up till 
now, we don’t really see any evidence of this. There is no data to work 
with. So that’s what we’re trying to do when we go out and work with a <span class="companylink">Glencore</span>
 for battery electric vehicles or with vendors and consortiums: develop 
evidence, and then these things can be linked to productivity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But right now, we’re 
still in pilot mode to develop this evidence to link to quarterly 
results and see that they’re driving results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subo Chatterjee: We do 
analysis of failed projects in relation to innovation and what we 
noticed is that most companies invest in a vision. They do pilots and 
then jump to transformation. What they’re missing is their bottom-up 
capability, and building it up within their organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They’ve invested in all 
this technology and all these assets, but what they haven’t done is 
build their workforce to deal with that level of change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s where a lot of the
 transformations fail because a lot of their workforce is not ready for 
that. If you build up the innovation story in a gradual approach as a 
confidence-building exercise, if might help, and that may apply to 
investors, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gordon Stothart: Then you get <span class="companylink">Goldcorp</span> 
with Probe and the “clean slate” idea. Our next project Côté is like 
that in the same way: a clean slate. You don’t have a lot of the other 
inertia to change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s really tough to 
gradually change a mining operation because of all the aforementioned 
reasons: you make big investments that are very expensive, and to 
incrementally change them is a challenge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walter Siggelkow: On the 
technology provider end of it, we don’t believe it’s the mine’s business
 to go out and try to convince shareholders to buy into unknown, 
unproven technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At some point in time the
 vendors have to go out and put our money where our mouth is. And we 
have to invest our own money and build products that actually make money
 for the mine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you sell something to a mine, it needs to make money. It needs to put black on the balance sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And investors are going to invest in the mine that makes money. That’s return on investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As an innovation-driven company, 30% of our revenues go right back into R&amp;D every year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So if I want to sell to the mine next year, well, I better have something to sell them that’s going to make them money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Mullally: That’s why Walter’s Hard-Line won northern Ontario’s Entrepreneur of the Year Award. A shout-out to Walter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: Let’s wrap up by 
asking each of you our poll question: Who is the biggest driver of 
innovation today in mine development? Is it mining companies, mining 
suppliers, government research institutes or universities and colleges? 
Our poll respondents gave us a tie, saying the answer is mining 
companies and mining suppliers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subo Chatterjee: It’s all of the above.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Matt Manson: Mining suppliers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gordon Stothart: Mining suppliers. And mining companies right behind that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walter Siggelkow: [Mining
 suppliers] to an extent. At the end of the day, we need these minerals.
 We need to mine them, and we need to mine them safely, and cheaper and 
faster. We need to make better use of these orebodies, anything to lower
 the cut-off point so we can take out more of the minerals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everything drives the innovation, but money drives it at the end of the day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Mullally: The 
biggest factor would be people’s values. If you think about who we are 
trying to attract at a remote site, people have different values and 
make different choices. They don’t want to come work at these remote 
sites. Or the regulators themselves, if they see things differently and 
they don’t want to move forward, there are tremendous barriers that can 
be put up. The changing role of First Nations and indigenous communities
 around the mine site play a part. If it’s not acceptable in their view,
 there’s not much that a mining company can really do to gain that 
acceptability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it’s really the shift in values and we’re seeing that everywhere, domestically and internationally</p>

 this eighth and final installment of reports from the Progressive Mine 
Forum hosted by The Northern Miner in Toronto in October, we present an 
edited transcript of a roundtable discussion between six mining industry
 veterans on the topic of innovation in mine development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The roundtable participants were: Subo Chatterjee, vice-president of consulting and business transformation leader at <span class="companylink">PwC Canada</span>; Ewan Downie, president and CEO of <span class="companylink">Premier Gold Mines</span>
 (TSX: PG; US-OTC: PIRGF); Matt Manson, president and CEO of Stornoway

Stothart, executive vice-president and chief operating officer of 
Iamgold (TSX: IMG; NYSE: IAG). Northern Miner editor-in-chief John 
Cumming served as moderator.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Northern Miner:Let’s begin with Gord. Over your 30-year career in mining, what changes have you seen in mine development?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gordon Stothart: A lot of it comes from automating physical tasks on the
 engineering side — taking away the physical side. I’m enough of a 
dinosaur that I did dump designs and road designs with French curves and
 compasses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mechanical piece of 
design has changed drastically. The equipment certainly is starting to 
change, but it takes a long time. I saw my first movie on automated 
trucks in 1984 and we’re still trying to get automated trucks into open 
pit mines. So it doesn’t always move quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot of the change is the communication and economic theories that we can apply to the mines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at the end of the day, we still blow it up and move it to produce metal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM:Matt, could you 
compare building Diavik and those other diamond mines in the Territories
 two decades ago with Stornoway’s recent experience building the Renard 
diamond mine in Quebec?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Matt Manson: I’d echo the sentiment of Gord in that mine development 
over the past 20 years hasn’t changed as much as you think it might. The
 big difference between building Diavik and building Renard was the 
management of it: Diavik was EPCM and Stornoway was self-managed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have to remember that 
mining is a non-innovative business because it’s capital intensive. We 
raise all the money up front to build these mines and we try very hard 
not to screw it up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The people who are giving you the money to do that are inherently risk-averse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Renard, we’re bringing
 in waste-ore sorting and that’s an innovation that is quite current and
 topical. We’re doing that because we have a specific issue in our 
process plant that we’re addressing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It looks great as we’re 
doing all the data. It’s going to work and it’s modestly priced, and 
there’s a great fallback position if we don’t get the results we want.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s a no-brainer to do it, but when I talk to investors about it, the first question I get is: “What other company does that?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you get that kind of
 a question from an investor, that is the risk aversion of the mining 
and financing community against innovation. That holds us back, for 
sure.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: Turning to John, <span class="companylink">Goldcorp</span> is quite aggressive in describing the changing future of <b>energy</b>
 in mining and the company has planned its Borden gold mine in Ontario 
to be an all-electric mine when it is built. Could you describe <span class="companylink">Goldcorp</span>’s overall concept of <b>energy</b> use going forward and Borden as a case study?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Mallally: I don’t think we’re immune to what Matt was mentioning in terms of the capital raised and the sunk capital, and <span class="companylink">Probe Mines</span> (the previous owner of Borden before its acquisition by <span class="companylink">Goldcorp</span>) was already $400 million along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Borden was really seen as a greenfield project and an opportunity to take a new look and have a clean slate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From my perspective on 
some of the risks and challenges, we’re starting to see them addressed 
now. We’re nearing the end of advanced exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other issues revolve 
around social acceptability and attracting top talent, as well. Turning 
the page in terms of the reputation of the mining industry has been 
interesting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulators — you might be
 surprised — are really excited about these new technologies as there 
are implications when it comes to operating electric vehicles in the 
underground mine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We’ve seen a lot of OEMs 
(original equipment manufacturers) and vendors and other partners coming
 on, including First Nations communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We were faced with those same significant challenges, in particular the capital raised and the risk aversion because of that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we’ve taken these 
strides and are halfway through. We’ve not entirely proven out the 
concept of an all-battery-electric-vehicle mine, but are enough along to
 start to point the way to some of the benefits. It’s been an 
interesting journey thus far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In terms of results, there’s work to be done, but we’re starting to see some of the payoff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: Subo, your specialty
 is advising on procurement and supply chain management. Could you give 
us your latest insights on these topics in relation to mine development,
 and what is PwC’s “Procurement 4.0” system?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subo Chatterjee: When we talk about innovation … that has sort of been the trend or messaging from 2014 all the way to 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We recently did a survey 
of companies globally — including 2,200 mining companies —and ask 
questions about their adoption rates for new technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What we noticed was about
 9% of companies had adopted a long-term strategy for innovation. And at
 the other end of the spectrum about 20% of companies were more 
opportunistic, with no long-term vision and only going after a few 
areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We took a step back to look at what investment really was happening and put them into four clusters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first was around automation and robotics, and that was where the biggest investment was happening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second was what we call the "digitally enabled" workforce. How do empower your employees to drive forward more productively?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third was around 
integrated enterprises. With all the data you’ve created, how does it 
feed back into your systems? Do you have integration between your field 
workers and your corporate data centres?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fourth is about advanced analytics, which links to our conversations earlier today on “big data”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What we noticed is that 
it was the first two areas where we saw investment and focus, while the 
last two areas is where there wasn’t a whole lot of focus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other aspect was the 
investment by the mining industry in innovation versus other industries.
 Certainly the trend since 2014 is more research and development 
(R&amp;D) in mining compared to other industries on a relative basis but
 not an absolute one. The trend is upward, but there’s some catching up 
to do.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: Ewan, asking you a 
similar question posed to Gord and Matt, comparing today to your Wolfden
 days, are you running Premier any differently from an innovation 
perspective?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ewan Downie: Not really. 
As a new producer we actually view the future of our mines being 
exploration, so there’s a big exploration focus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the innovations 
I’ve seen since I’ve been in this industry are the automation 
underground. That’s pretty important for safety. Underground mines 
aren’t the safest places to be working.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance at our 
Mercedes mine, years ago going underground with the guys driving the 
scoops, if there was a groundfall they would be covered (but now) at 
Mercedes the trucks sit tens of metres away from the operator working 
and I think it’s pretty important to see that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of <span class="companylink">Goldcorp</span>’s work at the Musselwhite mine in remote northern Ontario is actually done with employees working from pods in Thunder Bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The automation of machinery in mining has been really impressive over the last decade or so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In running our company, 
it’s changing our people that has been one of the biggest challenges. To
 facilitate being an explorer with almost all geologists to being mainly
 mining engineers has been a big change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: Following up on 
autonomous machinery and remote operations, Walt, could you give us a 
rundown on the state of the art in these areas?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walter Siggelkow: The 
equipment that actually runs at Musselwhite is our equipment. The guys 
at surface run the machines underground and now they run it out of the 
Thunder Bay office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking at the long term,
 what does that give the people that work in the mines? Well if you take
 a person out of the underground, they’re safer. It is a very harsh 
environment underground. We have to work there but if we can get the 
guys out, then don’t put them underground to start with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you take and you 
move some operations — not all — to a major centre, now you have your 
workers who can go home at night and spend their time with their 
families, changing the typical culture of living in a camp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These sorts of 
technologies are really moving ahead, and they’re available for many 
companies around the world. There are big players and there are smaller 
players like ourselves who specialize in retro-fitting equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I always say to my people
 as we work on a project: there’s a lot of discussions these days about 
capital. Our job, first of all, is I want to get some money from the 
mine. Our job as a supplier is to sell to you guys, but I need to make 
you guys money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So that’s the first thing we have to look at: do we add to the bottom line? How do we put black on that balance sheet?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[caption id="attachment_1003793769" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Ready to dump ore at <span class="companylink">Iamgold</span>'s Rosebel gold mine in Suriname. Photo by John Cumming.[/caption]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: How do you foster an “innovation culture” in a mining company? I saw an example of that culture take root at <span class="companylink">Iamgold</span>’s
 mine in Suriname with Gord last month where there was an existing 
workforce that became far more productive. How much is it about getting 
the right people, and how much is it a matter of training?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gordon Stothart: Carrying forward with your comments on what we were 
able to do in Suriname at our Rosebel mine, it was a case of “necessity 
was the mother of invention.” That place was closing quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenge was 
obvious, and the team that really took that challenge by the teeth 
brought in whatever they could to the table to point it in the right 
direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What’s quite interesting 
is you’d think you’d get cost-cutting fatigue or product-improvement 
fatigue after going at this pretty hard for a few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But actually every 
success energized us a little bit more, and a little bit more. That’s a 
piece of it — necessity — but another piece of it is just some vision. 
And it’s not necessarily executives providing that vision, but asking 
for the local managers and workforce to provide their own vision and 
working with them to crystallize that and take it forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You have to think about 
where you want to be. Our mines are changing from short life mines to 
longer life ones. I don’t want to be in a meeting 15 years from now — if
 they still let me hang around and do that — and looking at what today 
is current technology and saying, “This is way we do things and this is 
the way we’ve always done things.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can’t allow that to happen. You have to get involved with the teams in creating a vision to move it forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: Matt, you built up a mine workforce from almost zero at Renard. Your thoughts?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Matt Manson: If you look at our business, all the things that were 
innovative were problem-solving. We were the first mine in Canada to use
 liquid natural gas (LNG) for power, because we were sufficiently remote
 that we didn’t have a power line and it’s expensive to bring one in, 
but we’re not so remote that we don’t have a road. There’s a 
liquefaction terminal in Montreal so we can have trucks going up and 
down every day. So we have Caterpillar LNG gen sets rather than <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> diesel gen sets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That solved an 
infrastructure problem, and everybody in our stakeholder group was quite
 happy to see that happen, and it happened to reduce our greenhouse gas 
emissions. But it wasn’t done for efficiency or cost reasons, it was 
done for problem-solving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s important to have a 
motivated team, because it’s often a bottom-up thing, innovation in 
mining. That wasn’t my idea to do LNG, that was a bunch of engineers who
 came up with a clever idea knowing there was a gas terminal in 
Montreal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it’s bottom-up and a freedom to come up with clever ideas and some endorsement and support for that.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: How do you reward 
great ideas from your workforce? They just get to keep their jobs, or do
 they get a cut of the money savings? What is the incentive to innovate 
from the individual worker’s perspective?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Matt Manson: We bonus people at bonus time because we value clever ideas and we want to reflect that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subo Chatterjee: I want 
to build on that point. One of our clients last year was struggling with
 knowledge retention because their retirement rate is pretty high. You 
have to then ask what are the age groups and what is the impact over the
 next 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What we noticed is that 
about 40% of the Canadian workforce is the baby boomers. The retirement 
rate will double in the next 10 years for most companies. And about 35% 
was Gen Y, which is 35 years old and less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the challenge is you 
have two ends of the spectrum: The baby boomers have all the operational
 knowledge, and the younger generation has the technology side of 
things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most companies, your 
challenge is going to be that as you have innovation coming in, your 
adoption rate for your experienced staff is going to be lower than for 
the younger ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How do you have the younger people train the baby boomers with the new technology while retaining your operational knowledge?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of our clients has 
adopted “cross-learning” where they have younger people training older 
people on tele-remote operations while at the same time learning about 
day-to-day operations from the older people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other aspect is the 
pace of technological change. What’s true today may not even exist 10 
years from now. So training people on specific technology may not be the
 solution, so it’s more about what we call “digital IQ”. Are you 
instilling the values of innovation and reacting to change every couple 
of years?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Mullally: I was 
thinking about the top-down approach, and our management has a pretty 
simple approach to innovation, and the first part is just, “Let’s do 
it.” The other part is challenging others. We have the history of the 
Goldcorp Challenge more than 10 years ago, and more recently we have 
started the Disrupt Mining event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there’s partnering aspect. Sitting next to Walter here, and meeting others suppliers today, we know what <span class="companylink">Goldcorp</span>
 can do and set out that vision, but we know there are a lot of other 
actors in that space. We need to know what we’re good at and then find 
others to collaborate with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: When I started at 
the Miner 21 years ago, one of the first innovation stories I wrote was 
about Noranda and its Magnola project in Asbestos, Que., where a 
Noranda-led consortium was going to take asbestos tailings and make 
magnesium metal from the tailings. They spent a billion dollars on it, 
and they were using hydrofluoric acid which ate through everything. It 
worked beautifully at the bench scale, but when they scaled it up to a 
commercial level, it was a total failure and almost wrecked the company,
 and arguably prevented Noranda from becoming a super-major like a BHP 
or <span class="companylink">Rio Tinto</span>. Now it’s a shell of 
itself: they got rid of their research department in Quebec when Xtrata 
took over. My question is: when do you get too far ahead on the 
innovation curve as company? What is the sweet spot?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gordon Stothart: We call it the “bleeding edge”. You need to be 
innovative but you need to recognize when you’re going down a rabbit 
hole and pull your head up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You need to have enough 
of a relationship with your shareholders and your board and the people 
who run the company, that you can say, “Yeah, you’re going to make some 
mistakes along the way.” Not necessarily disastrous mistakes, but it’s 
risk versus reward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are you risking the whole
 company on an innovative idea? If you’re going down that road, you’re 
spending a lot of time thinking before you start doing, because it 
starts to get really expensive once you start doing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: Let’s take questions
 from the floor and online viewers. Alistair asks: “Should mining 
companies be obligated to contribute to a common R&amp;D organization to
 advance mining technology?” We do have talk these days of encouraging 
“innovation clusters” across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Mullally: I don’t 
know about “obligated” but going back to partnering: we need to 
understand where the sweet spot is for companies, and where there may be
 a broader group, a bigger community that may be able to add a lot of 
value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plus, there is the aspect
 of not necessarily competing on every aspect of the business. Do we 
need to be competing on battery electric vehicles, for example, when 
there are so many health and safety aspects when you’re able to remove 
diesel from the underground environment and improve the operating 
conditions?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do we need to be 
competing on tailings management? Tailings management could be 
outsourced and taken away from every operator. To me, if we had one 
consortium that was looking at ways of doing that — sort of a service 
model — why wouldn’t that be a good thing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walter Siggelkow: 
Innovation is driven by need, and you can’t force people to pay for 
something they don’t want. They need to need it. As a supplier, I’d 
prefer to leave my money in my hands, and I’ll go out and build stuff, 
and if I build a good thing, I’ll go out and sell it to people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There shouldn’t be an 
obligation to force mining companies to pay more taxes — which is what 
this really would be — to give to what someone decides is a good 
opportunity. We make our own opportunities, and if it’s a good product, 
you guys will buy it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ewan Downie: Competition 
is good, too. If there is a common organization and they have a monopoly
 on that technology, it will probably drive the cost up. And as a mining
 company, you’re always looking at ways to bring costs down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So that would be a bit of a mistake and a lot of the innovation is coming from different groups coming up with different ideas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[caption id="attachment_1003791605" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Tele-remote operators working at <span class="companylink">Goldcorp</span>’s Red Lake gold mine in Ontario. Credit: Goldcorp.[/caption]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: Another question 
from the crowd: “How would you build less invasive mines?” For example: 
less water usage, lowered noise, less dust, etc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Matt Manson: I think we have that now. We’re all moving down a path of 
less-invasive mining and smaller footprints. Whether that’s a formalized
 code from a regulatory authority that’s uniform or we’re all responding
 to our own regulatory agencies, we’re all trying to behave in a 
socially responsible, conscientious manner. That’s a long-term evolution
 in our business, and that will continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gordon Stothart: We’re trying to bond together and work as an industry 
to come up with solutions. And it’s not just for altruistic, pure 
environmental reasons or even social reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are plenty of 
economic reasons to have a smaller footprint. You spend all your money 
from day 1 separating ore from waste till you get that piece of metal, 
and each step is more and more expansive. So the more surgical you can 
be at the start, helps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flipside of it is: as
 metals become scarcer, prices go up and cut-off grades go down, and you
 start to look at larger excavations. There’s a bit of a conundrum at 
work there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: Goldcorp CEO David 
Garofalo speaking at our Canadian Mining Symposium in London last May 
was quite adamant that water usage would be the number one issue in 
terms of <b>social acceptance</b> of a mining project. We see it all the
 time in Latin America where, if agriculture conflicts with mining, 
agriculture usually wins the day these days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Mullally: Even in 
Ontario, water is one of the primary concerns when you’re trying to 
develop a mine. One of the biggest things is we need to be up to speed 
with is what’s socially acceptable, and what are the alternatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You see development times
 being 15 to 20 years from when a prospect is found to when a mine comes
 into operation. We really need to take a look at how to make that more 
efficient and take those projects through the social acceptability part.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: Circling back to 
Gord’s point about the falling cut-grades over time: what is the 
practical lower limit for cut-off grades these days for a commercial 
mine, and what trend are we likely to see in the future?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Matt Manson: In this question, we’re not all created equal — and this is
 where everybody has to be a geologist — because some mineral settings 
lend themselves to going into the sub-1-gram-gold material, and some 
deposits are more binary like a volcanogenic massive sulphide deposit or
 a kimberlite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it’s not every sector 
of the mining industry that is able to expand with a lower cutoff into 
the lower-grade material. It’s the gold guys that probably have this 
option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gordon Stothart: At what price of gold? There will be a lower limit for 
any given time space, but into the future, it’s harder to figure out 
where it goes. Innovation and technology will allow you to mine it that 
much more cheaply. Supply and demand will drive the price to wherever it
 goes, depending on the availability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I’m not geologist, so 
don’t shoot me in the head for this, but as for the “easier deposits” in
 “more comfortable” jurisdictions, we’re now mining those or have 
already mined through them. The next suite of deposits could either be 
more challenging in terms of location, grade or other technical aspects,
 and more challenging from the explorationist side in being able to find
 it. It’s an ongoing march.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes you get these 
incredible technologies appear. When heap leaching in gold mining and 
solvent-extraction electrowinning in the copper business came in, they 
completely changed the whole suite of what was mineable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The counter to that is 
the number of oxide copper deposits in the world is somewhat limited, 
and probably most of them have been discovered now. So as that goes 
away, you have to find something else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Processing really is an 
important piece of the technology. I think on the pure mining side, 
you’re going to asymptotically approach productivities that are hard to 
go beyond.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: Another future trend
 in mine development that Barrick Gold president Kelvin Dushnisky and 
David Garofalo both emphasized in our London symposium was the increased
 use of joint ventures in developing mining camps, because today they 
have too much overcapacity in terms of duplicate mills and 
infrastructure and such. What is the future of this kind of partnership 
model?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gordon Stothart: It’s interesting, because our CEO Steve Letwin opened 
the program this morning and he comes from an oil and gas background, 
and it confounds the heck out of him to look at these clusters of mines 
in elephant country and they all get set up as separate little 
self-sufficient operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the oil business you’d
 form a consortium around that, and go for the economies of scale around
 it. It’s not a model that is used very often in the mining business. 
That’s somewhat distinct from joint ventures, but there’s a bit of 
overlap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it’s true of any sort
 of innovation, where we need to intentionally look outside of where 
mining is. When I look at automated trucks, I’m not really interested in
 investing in truck automation any more. With the automation of 
driverless vehicles, there’s a much bigger industry out there that’s 
going to solve all of those problems for us in the next three or four 
years. Why would we invest a penny for that for trucks?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Mullally: Before the
 Chilean project with Teck became NuevoUnion, it was El Morro and it 
went to the Supreme Court in Chile, and we just walked away from the 
project knowing: why would we ever build two tailings facilities, two 
desalination plants and two milling complexes within however many 
kilometres apart from each other?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was really the 
imperative there. You wouldn’t see a Sudbury model where you have two 
different facilities right next door to each other, building the same 
infrastructure and taking up twice the footprint and twice the water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Especially on the water 
front in Chile, with their massive shortages. So that was something we 
recognized and didn’t even challenge the Supreme Court decision and 
walked away at that point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subo Chatterjee: This is a
 trend we’re seeing across industries, and supply chain and warehousing 
is one area where there is potential to have companies collaborate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key question where 
some industries get stuck is when there is an increased demand and there
 is a shortage of supply, who gets the supply? Because if your 
operations are at risk, how do you have balanced commitment of supply? 
There are also issues of intellectual property and contractual 
obligations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is being 
discussed, and the rail industry is making progress, and oil and gas has
 made progress. We haven’t seen that in mining yet, but these are topics
 of discussion. It is not a trend, at least for the next year or so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: Another question 
from the floor: what do you think is required for changing the mindset 
of mining investors such that to-be-proven technologies are funded and 
embraced?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ewan Downie: I don’t know
 if that’s possible. We’re seeing more passive investors investing in 
our sector rather than active investors, so I don’t think a lot of those
 investors care about what innovations are going on. They buy a basket 
of stocks and whatever happens, happens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gordon Stothart: Some of it goes back to vision. You need to sell the 
vision of why you’re doing it. It’s challenging. In quarterly reports 
and so on, the feedback on innovation is lost a little bit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As an industry, we’ve moved from a model when we started that <span class="companylink">Inco</span> had a research facility and Falconbridge had a research facility and Noranda had one, Cominco, Teck and so on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of those big 
companies have since moved offshore, and all of those facilities have 
gone away. We’re right in the midst of trying to reinvent how we do 
technology as a mining industry in this country. It’s challenging and 
it’s a tough sell for investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Matt Manson: Investors are moving away from being a fund manager that’s 
interested in a specific sector and a specific team and specific 
long-term vision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s become a short-term 
vision. It’s exchange-traded-funds driven, and become much more passive.
 For investors, it’s about the next quarterly report. That’s the mark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s not how clever and forward-thinking the management team is. Unfortunately, that’s the way it’s been going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gordon Stothart: Earlier, we spoke about “needs-driven” so that if the 
demands come from either the technical aspects of the deposit itself or 
the regulatory space or the social space where you’re trying to open up 
operations, you just have to get better at it. I think at some point in 
time, the investor community will follow it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a segment of the
 investor community that is specifically focused on ethical investments 
and is driving in those directions. It’ll take some learning, but it can
 get there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Mullally: Up till 
now, we don’t really see any evidence of this. There is no data to work 
with. So that’s what we’re trying to do when we go out and work with <span class="companylink">Glencore</span>
 for battery electric vehicles or with vendors and consortiums: develop 
evidence, and then these things can be linked to productivity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But right now, we’re 
still in pilot mode to develop this evidence to link to quarterly 
results and see that they’re driving results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subo Chatterjee: We do 
analysis of failed projects in relation to innovation and what we 
noticed is most companies invest in a vision. They do pilots and then 
jump to transformation. What they’re missing is their bottom-up 
capability, and building it up within their organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because they’ve invested 
in all this technology and all these assets, but what they haven’t done 
is build their workforce to deal with that level of change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s where a lot of the
 transformations fail because a lot of their workforce is not ready for 
that. If you build up the innovation story in a gradual approach as a 
confidence-building exercise, if might help, and that may apply to 
investors, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gordon Stothart: Then you get <span class="companylink">Goldcorp</span> 
with Probe and the “clean slate” idea. Our next project Cote is like 
that in the same way: a clean slate. You don’t have a lot of the other 
inertia to change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s really tough to 
gradually change a mining operation because of all the aforementioned 
reasons: you make big investments that are very expensive, and to 
incrementally change them is a challenge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walter Siggelkow: On the 
technology provider end of it, we don’t believe it’s the mine’s business
 to go out and try to convince shareholders to buy into unknown, 
unproven technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At some point in time the
 vendors have to go out and put our money where our mouth is. And we 
have to invest our own money and build products that actually make money
 for the mine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you sell something to a mine, it needs to make money. It needs to put black on the balance sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And investors are going to invest in the mine that makes money. That’s return on investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As an innovation-driven company, 30% of our revenues go right back into R&amp;D every year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So if I want to sell to the mine next year, well, I better have something to sell them that’s going to make them money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Mullally: That’s why Walter’s Hard-Line won northern Ontario’s entrepreneur of the year award. A shout-out to Walter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TNM: Let’s wrap up by 
asking each of you our poll question: Who is the biggest driver of 
innovation today in mine development? Is it mining companies, mining 
suppliers, government research institutes, or universities and colleges?
 Our poll respondents gave us a tie, saying the answer is mining 
companies and mining suppliers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subo Chatterjee: It’s all of the above.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Matt Manson: Mining suppliers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gordon Stothart: Mining suppliers and mining companies right behind that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walter Siggelkow: It is 
to an extent (mining suppliers). At the end of the day, we need these 
minerals. We need to mine them, and we need to mine them safely, and 
cheaper and faster. We need to make better use of these orebodies, 
anything to lower the cut-off point so we can take out more of the 
minerals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everything drives the innovation, but money drives it at the end of the day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Mullally: The 
biggest factor would be people’s values. If you think who we are trying 
to attract at a remote site, people have different values and make 
different choices. They don’t want to come work at these remote sites. 
Or the regulators themselves if they see things differently and they 
don’t want to move forward, there are tremendous barriers that can be 
put up. The changing role of First Nations and indigenous communities 
around the mine site play a role. If it’s not acceptable in their view, 
there’s not much that a mining company can really do to gain that 
acceptability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it’s really the shift in values and we’re seeing that everywhere, domestically and internationally.</p>

claims of more than US$47 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brazil's worst ever

 Samarco dam failure flooded the small town ofBento Rodrigues in Minas 
Gerais, Brazil.Source: Associated Press Investors, in particular those 
with strict compliance frameworks, have long been wary of the risks 
linked to mining, not least because the public's image of the industry 
is widely that of a dirty business. Now, large asset owners and managers
 have been insisting that miners adopt environmental, social and 
governance principles, and the industry, conscious of its reputation, is
 moving in that direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent survey by the <span class="companylink">International Council on Mining &amp; Metals</span>, or ICMM, showed that issues around <b>social acceptance</b>
 of mining and environmental improvements rank highest among 
stakeholders as the topics the industry is likely to face in the 
midterm. The ICMM invited comments from its own database of contacts, 
nearly 8,000 private and public-sector companies, trade associations, 
nongovernmental organizations and academic organizations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results are very much
 in line with an accelerating trend among pension funds, sovereign 
wealth funds and other investors with strict mandates to divest risky 
portfolio allocations such as coal and mountaintop removal operations, 
which are typically linked to large-scale deforestation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Norway's Norges Bank</span> Investment 
Management annually reviews its portfolio alignment with sustainable 
business models. The fund, at 8,522 billion Norwegian kroner, or about 
US$1 trillion, the world's biggest sovereign wealth fund, in recent 
years gradually decreased its exposure to companies active in coal 
mining or associated with questionable mining techniques.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many lenders have taken a similar stance, pulling out of dubious mining deals amid growing pressure from shareholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, they have not 
exited the mining industry per se but merely narrowed their focus based 
on risk-management strategies and ESG principles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just this week, <span class="companylink">National Australia Bank Ltd</span>. announced it will no longer finance new thermal coal mining projects but increase lending to renewable <b>energy</b> projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Investors are crucially 
important; we are starting to see more responsible investment," the 
ICMM's sustainability manager, Paul Taylor, told S&amp;P Global Market 
Intelligence in an interview. "[They] want to understand what risk they 
have in their portfolio, and having evidence that shows how companies 
are responding to the increasing challenges around social and 
environmental performance is giving investors more confidence."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sustainable developments reduce risk</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ICMM is an industry 
body whose declared purpose is to drive change for establishing a safe, 
fair and sustainable mining industry. Members of the organization, now 
comprising 25 multinational mining companies, commit to implementing 10 
principles as well as a number of position statements for sustainable 
development, pursuing best practices in areas such as human rights, 
safety, environmental performance and sustainable governance. 
Transparency is crucial in this context.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are starting to see a
 lot of more movement around investor interest in this field," Taylor 
said. "As far as investors are concerned, [when these principles are 
deployed] they understand that a mine is going to be sustainable … which
 would reduce the risk for a lot of communities, for example."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Often mining operations 
only get approval from authorities if companies contribute to local 
infrastructure, communities, and other economic aspects such as 
employment rates. This can involve housing, education and health 
facilities as well as taxes or royalties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alongside the social and 
economic components, environmental factors play a role, including water 
management with the aim to reduce fresh water usage, a reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions and <b>energy</b> usage as well as reduced tailings or waste.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a real 
opportunity to start incorporating new technology, and we are starting 
to see new technology come through," said Taylor, adding that miners and
 key suppliers are encouraged to work collaboratively on new technology.
 "The outcome of that is improved performance."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry aims for transparent sustainability standards</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Efforts to step up 
transparency around sustainability and ESG standards have been ongoing 
for years. Many companies release annual sustainability reports, 
maintain dedicated performance trackers or host investor days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Randgold Resources Ltd</span>., for example, plans to host an ESG event at an upcoming Cape Town conference in response to growing interest in the field.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Majors such as <span class="companylink">Rio Tinto</span>, <span class="companylink">Vale SA</span>, <span class="companylink">BHP Billiton Group</span> and <span class="companylink">Anglo American Plc</span>
 are just some players that have made it part of their mandate to 
release not only operational and financial results but also 
sustainability figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of these are driven by new technologies and innovations that are replacing conventional mining methods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a very clear 
business and ESG case for accelerating development and deployment of new
 technologies: improved [health, safety and environmental] performance, 
productivity gains and financial returns, supporting better workforce 
relations and a broader license to operate," <span class="companylink">Rio Tinto</span> wrote to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The list of such 
developments is long. Drones and electric or autonomous trucks are being
 introduced, resulting in less fuel usage and thus reducing the carbon 
intensity of mining activities, and intricate systems have been 
developed to reduce water and <b>energy</b> usage as well as waste material.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Examples of new technologies</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using special technology to withstand extremely cold winter conditions, <span class="companylink">Rio Tinto</span>
 installed four wind turbines at its Diavik diamond mine near the Arctic
 Circle in Canada. The turbines save the equivalent of about 100 fuel 
truck trips over a 300-kilometer ice road each year, reducing carbon 
emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Anglo American</span> actively invests in novel processing techniques that are more capital, <b>energy</b>
 and water efficient than conventional methods of comminution and 
concentration. The company explores microwave, sonic and pulse 
technologies to process ultrafine particles lost to tailings. Further 
ahead, it is looking at swarm robotics for the safe, precise and direct 
targeting of valuable ore on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has also been at the forefront of tackling water usage issues, aiming for waterless mining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have done some 
promising lab work on copper tailings using additives. Dry tailings is a
 really important area for us because water sent to tailings ponds often
 represents the largest water loss at a mine," the company's technical 
director, Tony O'Neill, told S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. "We 
meet three-quarters of our total operational water requirements by 
recycling/re-using water (2016). These types of dry processing 
techniques will allow us to reuse 80% of process water, moving us closer
 to our goal of a waterless mine — while delivering on our 
sustainability goals."</p>

instead of diesel engines. This will eliminate greenhouse gas emissions 
and result in healthier working conditions underground. Combined with an

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Imagine how much of a shift that has on our industry; in some cases, the equipment doesn't even exist yet," <span class="companylink">Goldcorp</span>'s
 Brent Bergeron, executive vice president corporate affairs and 
sustainability, said in an interview. "It basically means that we have 
to go back to our supply chain and force a change within their thinking.
 If they want to sell us equipment for this mine site that we are 
permitting as an all-electric mine ... they have to get on board with us
 and start developing that technology."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The initial cost of the equipment is higher than usual. This is partially offset by a C$5 million injection the <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span> provides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a member of the Paris Agreement on climate change, the government supports initiatives that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An opportunity for leadership</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equally important are the health and safety benefits for workers, who usually live in the surrounding communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What you have [as a 
result] is an initiative that is actually being supported by the 
government and local communities in terms of the permitting process," 
Bergeron said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Altogether, these 
components make it a lot easier to convince board members, shareholders 
and stakeholders that there is an actual financial case by changing the 
way of doing business, Bergeron said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As far as the perception 
of mining is concerned, he believes that innovation provides an 
opportunity to demonstrate that the mining industry can actually drive 
positive changes for stakeholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We can take a leadership
 position in this area because there are companies that are extremely 
innovative and will contribute to some of the [climate change] goals 
that we want to push forward."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CNSC does not license
 a reactor design until there is a specific project to be assessed. The 
regulator, however, has agreed to do “prelicensing reviews" for several 
developers of next-generation technology to provide guidance on whether 
the company would be able to win project approval for a new type of 
reactor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terrestrial will now move
 on to a Phase 2 review, in which the CNSC makes a detailed assessment 
of design features to determine whether there would be an fundamental 
barriers to licensing. In the Phase 1 review, the regulator concluded 
Terrestrial has substantial work to do to improve its analysis of design
 and safety issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company – which has received funding from Sustainable Development Technology Canada – is in early-stage discussions with <span class="companylink">Canadian Nuclear Laboratories</span>
 (CNL) about locating a commercial reactor at the government-owned, 
privately managed Chalk River site, 185 kilometres up the Ottawa River 
from the capital. CNL also recently invited expressions of interest from
 numerous developers to locate a prototype small modular reactor at the 
site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new-generation 
reactors are being touted as the future of the nuclear industry, which 
is looking to reinvent itself and win its share of the low-carbon-<b>energy</b> markets that is developing in response to climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One Terrestrial competitor is <span class="companylink">TerraPower LLC</span>, a Bellevue, Washbased company chaired by <span class="companylink">Microsoft Corp</span>. founder Bill Gates. <span class="companylink">TerraPower</span> is partnering with China National Nuclear Power Co. to build a nextgeneration plant in Hebei province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Irish said one 
190-megawatt reactor would cost less than $1-billion to build while 
current ones are typically 1,000-MW and cost closer to $10-billion. 
Since it does not rely on power to cool down, the molten salt reactor is
 impervious to the kind of catastrophic meltdown that occurred at 
Japan's Fukushima Daiichi site after an earthquake and tidal wave in 
2011, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, critics argue 
the industry's bet on small modular reactors will likely fizzle, as have
 past attempts to introduce new technology such as the Advanced Candu 
Reactor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Small modular reactors are just another expensive distraction away from the global transition to renewable-based <b>energy</b> system," said Shawn-Patrick Stensil, <b>energy</b> analyst with <span class="companylink">Greenpeace Canada</span>. “Winning an approval from the industry-friendly CNSC isn't difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real test for these untested designs is to win <b>social acceptance</b> and compete against the declining cost of renewables."</p>

http://www.equipedeniscoderre.com/[http://www.equipedeniscoderre.com/]? )</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: Why are you the right person for the job?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: A child of an 
immigrant family, I have been involved in this community for decades and
 lived in Pierrefonds-Roxboro since 1970. For 25 years, I have held 
positions (working for municipalities) as Director of Parks and 
Recreation and Division Manager of Culture, Sports, Recreation and 
Social Development. I was a councillor before (borough) mayor and sit on
 the Montreal Executive Committee responsible of Procurement, Sports and
 Recreation and Cultural Communities. I served my community in different
 capacities not only as coach for soccer and baseball (T-ball) but also 
sat on different local school governing boards. I have served on 
different boards of local non-profit organizations and volunteered many 
years in my community. I have successfully formed a Seniors Club 
celebrating 25 years and co-founded the West Island Blues Festival 
donating significant funds to non-profit West Island organizations for 
over 13 years. I have a citizen approach and I am well grounded in the 
community. I believe in civic engagement and have promoted many 
communications initiatives to better inform our population. I believe in
 responsible spending while improving our services to the population at a
 reasonable cost and with little financial impact to them. It is also 
the place I call home and privileged to raise my 2 daughters in this 
multiculturally diverse community where we all live together in harmony.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: If you are elected, what would be the first issue at borough hall that? you would tackle?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Continue to improve 
the services offered to our citizens focusing on the citizen experience 
by reducing bureaucracy and simplifying the procedures. Although 
restructuring of our core services occurred during the last mandate, 
more improvements are required to allow for more result oriented 
solutions in a more reasonable time frame. Continue to work towards 
making information available to the public through social media, 
applications and other platforms to help reduce valuable time in 
processing requests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: What is the biggest challenge your borough is facing and? how do you plan to address that challenge?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Continue to invest in 
local infrastructure as I have done during the last mandate working with
 our Montreal counterparts to effectively analyze the roadwork network, 
parks and sports infrastructure responding to the changing demographics 
of my borough and taking into consideration the taxpayer's capacity to 
pay. Continue to work with our provincial partners to address not only 
the impact to our citizens following the historic floods of 2017 but to 
also find viable solutions to address the problematic areas along our 
almost 30 km of riverbanks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Continue to work with the
 different levels of government to local organizations to address and 
find solutions on social issues such as homelessness, social housing, 
poverty, etc. affecting a portion of our community. Review and propose 
initiatives for our aging and mobility reduced population with specific 
needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: What is your overall vision for your borough for the? coming mandate?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Continue the work 
undertaken the last four years in realizing the different priorities 
outlined in the borough's Strategic Plan created by my administration, 
and as a result of many years of community interactions and requests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This includes: 
Reinforcing the borough's mission and values which contribute to 
creating and developing a coherent, meaningful and stimulating 
organizational culture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Continue to develop citizen participation of local democracy through collaboration, dialogue and information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consolidate a sense a 
belonging, pursue efforts intended to increase the quality of life 
Intensify efforts to protect environmental resources and support 
commercial development with priority projects for each category as 
outlined in the Strategic Plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, optimizing and 
sustainable management of our resources, and that target continuous 
improvement of services and residents' quality of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: What is your position on the residential project planned for western Pierrefonds?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: My position has not 
changed regarding the western portion of Pierrefonds West. I've always 
said that if this area is ever developed that it could be done 
responsibly finding a real balance between conservation and sustainable 
development. I requested public consultations to gather information and 
have an accurate portrait of the issues before any formal decision is 
ever taken. I had said on different occasions that I would respect any 
recommendations thereafter which I will do. I believe there is still a 
lot of information required before any final decision is taken. This 
includes environmental impact, cost feasibility, transport impact, <b>social acceptance</b>
 etc including citizen participation as recommended by the OCPM 
consultations. I have also passed resolutions at the borough level 
clearly stating that there could or never would be anything in this area
 if there is no urban boulevard (north south artery), with public and 
active transport opportunities.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hélène Dupont is running 
for borough mayor as a candidate with Projet Montréal( 
http://en.projetmontreal.org/splash_en[http://en.projetmontreal.org/splash_en]
 ). She has lived in Pierrefonds-Roxboro for 15 years and is raising two
 daughters there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: Why are you the right person for the job?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: I moved to 
Pierrefonds-Roxboro 15 years ago to raise my two children because of the
 borough's proximity to green space and for the quality of life. Those 
are aspects that I wish to preserve, even improve. Because I have been 
part of this community for so long, I share a strong bond with the 
citizens and have developed the knowledge of the issues that matter to 
them. My openness to others make me the ideal person to bring all the 
different cultures of our borough together and I intend to devote my <b>energy</b> to those people whose lives I share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: If you are elected, what would be the first issue at borough hall that you would tackle?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: The first issue that 
naturally comes to mind when thinking about our borough is flood relief.
 First, I would want to bring our support to the flood victims by making
 sure every aspect of their lives is back to normal. This spring's 
natural disaster has affected both our social and economical milieu and I
 believe we should invest in relocation and reconstruction as well as 
help our businesses that have been greatly affected. By providing the 
community with post-mortem assemblies, we could determine the next steps
 of the process which would ensure that the citizens never go through 
this again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: What is the biggest challenge your borough is facing and how do you plan to address that challenge?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Urban planning would 
be our biggest challenge. Every day, citizens are faced with traffic 
jams, construction, lack of safety on our streets, be it because of the 
absence of sidewalks, proper lighting or secured bike paths. Our borough
 has been built without the citizens in mind and our team wishes to 
modify the streets so that children can play safely, people can get to 
work rapidly and spend more quality time at home. Improving access to 
public transport as well as its frequency is also amongst our 
priorities. We want to create neighbourhoods where all modes of 
transportation can cohabitate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: What is your overall vision for your borough for the coming mandate?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Improving the quality 
of life of our citizens is key. Working closely with community partners,
 we would promote local businesses that would create employment 
opportunities for our locals as well as provide economical growth in 
Pierrefonds-Roxboro. At the heart of our vision, urban living would 
coexist with all the wonderful green space that surrounds us, green 
space that we would protect within a national park. We hope to multiply 
the possibilities to bring together the citizens while providing a 
window to our great cultural diversity, either through arts, sports or 
fairs and festivals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: What is your position on the residential project planned for western Pierrefonds?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Western Pierrefonds is
 one of the last green spaces on the Island of Montreal and is one of 
the jewels of our borough that we must protect. Projet Montréal already 
proposed to preserve the entirety of the wetlands and agricultural lands
 of the area by turning them into the first urban national park, 
including the already existing park Cap-St-Jacques. We want to promote 
these green spaces by allowing the residents to enjoy outdoor activities
 on this territory, while we would study different possibilities for 
traffic relief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justine McIntyre</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outgoing city councillor Justine McIntyre is running to become borough mayor in Pierrefonds-Roxboro.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justine McIntyre is the 
party leader for Vrai changement pour Montréal( 
http://vraichangementmtl.org/en/index.htm[http://vraichangementmtl.org/en/index.htm]
 ), a position previously held by Mélanie Joly( 
https://pm.gc.ca/eng/minister/honourable-melanie-joly[https://pm.gc.ca/eng/minister/honourable-melanie-joly]
 ), who is now Canada's Heritage Minister. McIntyre is the outgoing city
 councillor for the Bois-de-Liesse district in Pierrefonds-Roxboro. The 
former music teacher is also a mother of three children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: Why are you the right person for the job?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: I had a varied career 
before politics that taught me much about different places, people and 
situations. My experience as city councillor for the eastern district of
 Pierrefonds over the past four years has given me the opportunity to 
learn the inner workings of the city and borough. As party leader of 
Vrai changement pour Montréal, I have developed my leadership skills 
both as a team builder and team leader. I raised my family here in 
Pierrefonds-Roxboro and participated actively in the community as a 
volunteer with various associations. I am perfectly bilingual and above 
all, have a desire to better our community so that families can continue
 to enjoy an improved quality of life for generations to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: If you are elected, what would be the first issue at borough hall that you would tackle?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: The first issue I will
 tackle at (borough) hall is that of the bureaucratic culture. I want to
 open up (borough) hall to the public, to make it an accessible, 
friendly place to receive municipal services, a place where residents 
and business owners are treated as partners in the common goal of 
creating a happy community. Restoring a sense of pride of place and 
pride in public service is a primary goal for me as a new (borough) 
mayor. This will set the tone for future communications and enable us to
 better collaborate with the public during consultations on projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: What is the biggest challenge your borough is facing and how do you plan to address that challenge?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: In light of the recent
 floods, I would say that our biggest challenge is the damage and 
potential damage that is the direct result of climate change. As an 
immediate goal, I will ensure that we are able to better prepare for 
those challenges so that when disaster strikes in the form of flooding, 
flash rainstorms, ice storms or heat waves, we are able to swiftly 
provide help and spread information to residents. Therefore an overhaul 
of our borough's emergency plan and procedures is needed, which must 
also include a plan for mobilizing volunteers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: What is your overall vision for your borough for the coming mandate?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: My overall vision of 
Pierrefonds-Roxboro for the coming mandate is to improve services to 
residents and to work steadily and gradually on projects and planning 
with an aim to improving quality of life. With the current 
administration, big projects often overshadow day-to-day considerations 
and budgets are spent on big-tickets items rather than on more basic 
priorities such as street lamps, sidewalks and snow removal. I will 
ensure that our vision moving forward is that of a healthy community 
where walking and biking to the parks, to the train or to commercial 
areas is not just possible, it is pleasant; where our community 
organizations and associations thrive and where neighbourhoods are 
welcoming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: What is your position on the residential project planned for western Pierrefonds?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: I believe that any 
remaining, untouched green space on the island of Montreal, including 
the territory in western Pierrefonds referred to as l'Anse-à-l'Orme, 
should be preserved. I have firmly stated that position in the various 
Motions I tabled to city council as well as in a brief I presented to 
the Office of Public Consultation on the future of Pierrefonds West. Not
 only is the rich biodiversity of these areas well-documented; science 
teaches us that these natural spaces serve to purify the air we breathe 
and to filter rain and floodwater, thereby acting as natural buffers and
 increasing our resilience to climate-change induced events. The 
opportunity to add to and improve on currently urbanized areas is one 
that I aim to capitalize on, while leaving this vast natural area 
intact.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"On April 12, 2015, I

ways - from wheelchair to parabike to more unconventional ways, such as 
using a scooter and even a pogo stick."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After finishing the tour 
on Dec. 8, he decided to create the National Relay for Youth to further 
enforce the message of perseverance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2016, in the second

 - Opponents of oil and gas development in Quebec say they're prepared 
to ramp up their fight amid expectations that the provincial government 
could release new regulations on resource extraction in the coming 
weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of last year, 
the government passed legislation to enable production of oil and 
natural gas. In May, Natural Resources Minister Pierre Arcand said rules
 governing that activity would be released a month later and since then,
 both industry and opponents have been eagerly waiting for them.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carole
 Dupuis of the Regroupement vigilance hydrocarbures Quebec, which 
opposes oil and gas development, said her group will take their battle 
to communities in an effort to prevent an <b>energy</b> industry from taking off in the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If our politicians aren't there to defend us, the public will defend itself," said Dupuis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick Bonin, a climate and <b>energy</b> campaigner for <span class="companylink">Greenpeace</span>,
 said the push towards fossil fuel development runs counter to the 
province's global commitment to combat greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If the government was 
serious about its intention to respect the Paris Accord, then obviously 
there wouldn't be any project to get the green light," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the province may be
 better known for its wealth of hydroelectricity, it has plenty of 
natural gas. According to both the Quebec Oil and Gas Association and 
Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, it's believed to have 
enough natural gas to meet its needs for at least a century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 15 per cent of the 
estimated 176.7 trillion cubic feet of gas mainly in the Utica Shale 
formation along the St. Lawrence River is believed to be recoverable, 
the <span class="companylink">Canadian <b>Energy</b> Research Institute</span>
 says. A similar proportion of the 43.6 billion barrels of oil is 
recoverable primarily beneath Anticosti Island, though on Friday the 
government announced an end to drilling there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The regulations will permit fracking - which has riled some - but questions remain over where drilling will be allowed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A de facto moratorium on 
fracking has been in place since 2012, but the law passed in December 
will allow for it as long as companies secure authorization under the 
Environment Quality Act and social licence (though it's still unclear 
what constitutes social licence).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arcand was unavailable for comment, but a spokesman said the government's goal is to have the strictest legal framework on <b>energy</b> development in North America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pierre-Olivier Pineau, a professor specializing in <b>energy</b>
 at the University of Montreal HEC business school, said the government 
can't politically afford to have regulations that aren't stringent, even
 if the chances of widespread production are slim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Junex (TSX-V:JNX) and 
Petrolia (TSX-V:PEA) are seeking to extract oil and gas in remote 
regions of Gaspe, and Pineau said he believes they won't face much 
opposition, partly because they're in economically stressed areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither <b>energy</b> producer responded to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Binnion, CEO of Calgary-based Questerre <b>Energy</b>
 Corp. (TSX:QEC) and president of the Quebec Oil and Gas Association, 
said he hopes the regulations will be strong enough to gain public 
confidence that their water, air and land will be protected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will then be up to <b>energy</b> companies to secure <b>social acceptance</b> from communities, something Binnion concedes is largely lacking. <span class="companylink">Questerre <b>Energy</b></span> has drilled test wells on about 405,000 hectares it holds in the Utica Shale formation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't think the 
regulations by themselves are going to open a floodgate at all," he 
said. "We think the regulations could open the door to a discussion 
about the benefits and impacts."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Study on Technological Development in the Contraceptives Market</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the major key 
factors that have been driving the market for contraceptives are 
increasing government and NGO initiatives to promote contraceptives, 
significant population growth, and rising global prevalence of sexually 
transmitted infections. The side effects associated with the use of 
contraceptive drugs and devices such as rising prevalence of 
infertility, and the lack of <b>social acceptance</b> have hindered the growth of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A medical product manufacturing company based out of the US approached <span class="companylink">Infiniti</span>
 to understand the impact of launching the newly 505 device in target 
regions, patient demand, product awareness, and the expected 
cannibalization of the current product (305 device). This study helps 
organizations gain insights into the potential adoption patterns and 
demand for contraceptive devices, assisting with developing effective 
pricing strategies for target regions and identification of 
factors/solutions that would boost patient demand.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adoption of refrigeration
 is a mandate in the market across the pharmaceutical, food processing, 
chemicals, and oil and gas industries. Although the adoption of 
industrial refrigeration is witnessing exponential growth, the market is
 subjected to several challenges. Stringent regulation on the use of 
hydrofluorocarbons and growing environmental concerns are some of the 
factors hindering the growth of the market.</p>

 (“Questor” or the “Company”) (TSX-V:QST) is pleased to announce its 
financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2017. Revenue 
in the first quarter of 2017 was $3.0 million, an increase of 36 percent
 from the same period in 2016. The Company’s rental revenue increased to
 $1.5 million from $0.6 million due to higher activity in the United 
States. The Company increased the number of rental units by 68% compared
 to the first quarter in 2016. Rental utilization during the three 
months ended March 31, 2017 increased versus the same period of 2016 due
 to the Company relocating rental equipment to more active areas in the 
United States.</p>

 EBITDA of $0.8 million for the first quarter of 2017 increased from 
$0.2 million in the comparable period of 2016. The increased income and 
EBITDA is primarily due to the rental fleet expansion revenues and 
significantly higher utilization of equipment relocated to the United 
States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company’s success is 
based on the introduction and implementation of our “hybrid” 
incineration technology. The technology allows clients to purchase a 
base level of capacity and rent additional capacity to meet the shorter 
term demands of high initial production. The benefits to the client are 
lower capital and operating costs, reduced lease footprint and clean 
enclosed combustion to meet stringent emission regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on strong demand 
for our rental and hybrid equipment in the United States, Questor has 
set its 2017 capital budget to $3.5 million. The Company expects to add 
14 additional rental units by the end of the year, increasing the fleet 
approximately by 36 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questor has received $4.0
 million of orders from a key client for hybrid units to be delivered in
 2017. The Company is proud to be recognized and selected for its 
solutions and will continue its pursuit of earning the confidence and

state legislator has mandated the use of enclosed combustion which has 
resulted in producers more readily gaining approval for projects from 
state and local authorities as well as earning support from neighboring 
residents. Questor has worked diligently at providing high-quality 
products to industry that is meeting these demands. Questor’s has 
operations in Brighton, Colorado and will continue to hire local 
technicians for the area to ensure top level service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry in Colorado has 
started to embrace Questor’s “hybrid” incineration technology. Initial 
flow backs operations take place through a standard height incinerator. 
The top portion is removed after the flow back period and the same 
incinerator, with reduced capacity due to the reduced height, remains to
 serve the needs of the production facility. This consolidates emissions
 flow through one stack and reduces equipment handling and costs. This 
solution is preferred over historical methods due to its increased 
financial efficiency for clients as they only purchase the incinerator 
capacity that they require and rent the top portion during the temporary
 well testing operation. This approach balances revenue between sales 
and rentals for Questor while providing an innovative and efficient 
operation for our clients reducing their well pad site costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company expects to 
continue to expand its presence in the United States. The regulations in
 Colorado were a catalyst for growth in that State. Texas, Ohio, 
Pennsylvania and other states are considering similar regulation to 
Colorado. We believe this will create an opportunity for Questor to 
replicate the Colorado hub model in other areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Texas has also emerged as
 an area of significant growth with estimates of it being as much as ten
 times the activity in Colorado. This has resulted in a targeted effort 
to recruit sales representatives in key regions such as these aimed at 
expanding our services and equipment solutions. “With clear requirements
 and expectations from both the Federal and State agencies the US 
industry can now select equipment that serves their specific needs, 
including regulatory compliance, <b>social acceptance</b>, operating 
performance, reliability and technical support,” said Ms. Audrey 
Mascarenhas, Questor’s President and CEO. “Questor will continue to 
commit capital to grow its revenue in states where producers are looking
 for different technologies to manage their waste gases and fugitive 
emissions,” she added.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Join JWN and featured sponsor <span class="companylink">Siemens</span> in a Live Webinar that will tackle the most pressing compliance related issues facing companies today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In advance of the webinar — click here to register — we sat down with John Lusty, Director of <b>Energy</b> &amp; Utilities Solutions at Siemens Industry Software Ltd., to learn more about the topics that will be discussed.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1) How can companies drive better business decisions through compliance?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Lusty: While the oil
 &amp; gas industry seems to have turned the corner, most industry 
participants are still straining to reduce overhead while increasing 
efficiencies. The costs associated with compliance and quality 
management are part fixed and part variable, but there’s never been a 
better time to optimize those costs while avoiding the unnecessary 
impact of non-compliance. By taking an enterprise approach and 
consolidating silos of information, the cost-benefit of business 
decisions that are compliance related can be better understood and more 
consistently executed. The application of optimized compliance workflows
 and configurable status reporting can assist in ensuring that decisions
 made resulting from audits, assessments and corrective actions are 
actioned using a customer-defined standard methodology. Over time, a 
highly managed compliance and quality information system becomes a 
significant risk management tool for managers and executives trying to 
make better decisions to increase process efficiencies, while reducing 
the chance that some of those hard-earned gains will be eroded due to 
quality and compliance infractions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2) How can companies better control regulatory documentation and contingency planning?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JL: Taking an enterprise approach to compliance management provides <b>energy</b>
 companies with a framework for creating, modifying and versioning, 
approving, releasing and archiving all compliance documentation. 
Consistency in these important areas is achieved by automating 
customer-defined templates and workflows designed to meet internal and 
external requirements every time and on time, while also generating an 
audit of trail that records what happened, when and by whom in case 
that’s needed later. These same capabilities can be used in contingency 
planning to ensure that organizations respond to unexpected events in a 
way that is consistent with their internal and external requirements. 
Furthermore, given that different regulatory reporting regions and 
business units may have different requirements based on the user’s 
location, the ability to include that uniqueness while maintaining 
continuity is critical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3) How do companies deal with the increasingly onerous requirements for <b>social acceptance</b>?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JL: The oil &amp; gas 
industry in Canada has been under intense scrutiny from many audiences 
with many different interests and agendas and that will not change. The 
best way for companies not to put their social license to operate at 
risk is to not become a target in the first place. By taking a 
structured approach to consistently follow internal and external 
procedures for compliance and quality management is a foundational step.
 With this in place, operational excellence objectives such as operator 
training, asset integrity management, risk and regulatory reporting, 
corrective and preventative actions all become more achievable. With 
society’s requirements for companies to operate as expected, while 
keeping up with the changes that people, markets and governments expect 
of them, it’s not going to get easier. However, by adding a structured 
framework for how we manage those tasks consistently and completely, we 
are putting employees in a better position to make those tasks less 
onerous and fully achievable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4) What about environmental compliance?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JL: Everything we’ve 
discussed so far is equally applicable to the subject of environmental 
compliance as the cost of non-compliance can threaten a company’s 
existence. It’s a reasonable objective that by having properly trained 
employees working safely in a manner that complies with internal and 
external regulations, in a culture that strives for operational 
excellence, that the risk of an event threatening the environment should
 be minimized. That being said, it is nearly impossible to reduce risks 
to zero anywhere. Should an event occur that, it will be critical for 
companies to be able to demonstrate that a high level of due diligence 
to prevent the incident was taken, and to prove that they did everything
 that was required and that could be reasonably expected of them to 
prevent it from happening. This will be useful both as a basis to 
support their actions, but also to update and improve policies and 
procedures to reduce the risk of a similar event happening again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5) What do you hope participants will get from the <span class="companylink">Siemens</span> compliance webinar?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JL: Our intent is to be able to educate participants on how <span class="companylink">Siemens</span>
 solutions and expertise can add structure and predictability to their 
compliance and quality management, while reducing the cost and 
increasing their efficiency to do so. Quality and compliance are 
foundational to every part of the organization and can improve 
profitability if managed effectively. It’s another example of how the 
Siemens Digital Enterprise can be applied to make the Canadian <b>energy</b> industry more efficient, innovative and sustainable for the long term.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In
 Canadian ads, alcohol cannot be shown to enliven an otherwise dull 
party. Celebrities, athletes, or anyone who might be a role model to 
minors, are out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actors can’t be shown 
actually drinking the product, or even holding a half-empty glass. A 
game of “spin the bottle” is not acceptable. Ditto parties on a public 
beach. A couple at dinner cannot have a bottle of wine on the table – 
that would imply they are having more than one drink each.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are just a few of the restrictions on television ads for beverage alcohol. (Similar limitations apply in other media.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, as the federal 
government prepares to introduce legislation legalizing recreational 
marijuana use in Canada, booze companies have been pushing to ensure 
that this nascent industry will face similar restrictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That includes – but is not limited to – strict rules around marketing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As an industry, we’ve 
talked to various officials, provincially and federally, about the 
rationale for certain rules regarding beverage alcohol and how they’re 
probably applicable to marijuana, whether around labelling or celebrity 
endorsements,” said Andrew Oland, president and chief executive officer 
of Moosehead Breweries Ltd. and a board member of the industry 
association Beer Canada. That group took part in consultations with the 
federal task force on marijuana legalization and regulation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Things that are not permissible in beverage alcohol shouldn’t be permissible in marijuana,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beer Canada declined to 
share its submission to the task force. Spirits Canada shared its 
submission, which included more than a dozen recommendations on 
marketing and labelling regulations that should be imposed on 
recreational marijuana producers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of those 
recommendations are similar to the rules applied to alcoholic drinks, 
including that marketing should not “imply directly or indirectly that <b>social acceptance</b>,
 social status, sexual performance, personal success, or business or 
athletic achievement” are connected to marijuana use, or that it is 
“essential to the enjoyment of an activity or event.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drinks manufacturers are 
not allowed to imply that a higher alcohol level is preferable; Spirits 
Canada suggests the same for marijuana’s THC levels. (THC, or 
tetrahydrocannabinol, gives marijuana its intoxicating effect.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association’s 
submission also suggests parallel restrictions on implying immoderate 
consumption, or suggesting a “need” for marijuana in the same way that 
ads cannot imply that someone needs a drink. And any risk of appealing 
to minors – whether through flashy characters, or in the choice of 
venues where ads are placed – should be eliminated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alcohol, tobacco and pharmaceutical drugs all face some of the tightest restrictions in marketing and advertising in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you’re going to 
introduce another drug into the marketplace, why would you not subject 
that to exactly the same kinds of things that have proven to be 
effective in beverage alcohol?” said Jan Westcott, president and CEO of 
Spirits Canada. “Certainly, the advertising and marketing rules are 
there for a reason. … The underlying philosophy is, you don’t want to 
promote overconsumption.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The alcohol industry’s 
requests are not limited to advertising considerations: Mr. Westcott 
suggested that something like the Smart Serve program in Ontario, which 
mandates training for servers in “responsible” alcohol service, would be
 helpful for those selling marijuana. Establishing a minimum age for 
legal consumption is another industry focus, as is taxation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If they price marijuana 
too high, they’re going to allow the black market to flourish, and they 
don’t want to do that. Yet at the same time, you have some of the 
highest beer taxes in the world, in Canada. I’m not sure how you can 
sell marijuana at a low price and continue to tax beer at some of the 
highest prices in the world,” Mr. Oland said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spirits Canada’s 
submission also asked for taxes “no less than” those imposed on alcohol.
 It pushed for prohibiting the sale of marijuana at any retailer that 
also sells alcohol, though Mr. Westcott suggested that the provincial 
liquor boards could be involved in wholesale distribution. And the 
association believes that recreational marijuana use should not be 
allowed in public places.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of these priorities 
were reflected in the task force’s recommendations for legalization and 
regulation of cannabis, released in November. The report recommended a 
minimum purchase age of 18, while recognizing the right of provinces and
 territories to set the age at the same level as their restrictions for 
buying alcohol. The report also recommended strict restrictions on 
advertising, similar to those faced by tobacco – such as requiring plain
 packaging and prohibiting advertising appealing to children, as well as
 other limitations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report recommended 
balancing pricing and taxes to discourage illicit sales, but did not 
specify taxing pot at the same level as other substances such as 
alcohol. And it recommended not selling marijuana alongside alcohol.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ahead of the legislation,
 seven licensed marijuana producers have written 
(http://www.theglobeandmail.com.ezproxy.lib.ucalgary.ca/news/politics/marijuana-producers-lobby-ottawa-ahead-of-legalization-legislation/article34486690/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com.ezproxy.lib.ucalgary.ca/news/politics/marijuana-producers-lobby-ottawa-ahead-of-legalization-legislation/article34486690/])
 to the federal government asking for permission to use branding to 
compete with illegal sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether advertising is 
allowed or not, the marijuana industry has work to do build trust with 
Canadian consumers: In a recent survey 
(http://www.theglobeandmail.com.ezproxy.lib.ucalgary.ca/report-on-business/industry-news/marketing/marijuana-industry-faces-challenge-in-gaining-canadians-trust-survey-finds/article34466751/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com.ezproxy.lib.ucalgary.ca/report-on-business/industry-news/marketing/marijuana-industry-faces-challenge-in-gaining-canadians-trust-survey-finds/article34466751/])
 from <span class="companylink">Environics Communications</span>, just 
13 per cent of people agreed that they trusted the marijuana industry to
 “do what is right for Canada, Canadians and our society” – the lowest 
trust level reported out of 21 sectors, ranking it behind social media, <b>energy</b> and pipelines, and pharmaceutical companies.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questor Technology Inc</span>. has released its financial and operating results for the year ended Dec. 31, 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's revenue for
 the year ended Dec. 31, 2016, was $7,078,333, down by 13 per cent from 
$8,112,913 for the prior year. Revenues from the sale of incinerators 
decreased 18 per cent from the prior year impacted by the company's 
clients reducing activity and capital constraints, as a result of 
depressed oil and gas prices through 2016. The decline in sales revenue 
was offset by a 5-per-cent growth in revenue from rentals over the 
previous year. Total comprehensive loss for year-end Dec. 31, 2016, was

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue for this quarter 
was $2,482,679, an increase of 7 per cent from the corresponding quarter
 in 2015. Gross profit increased to $1,104,536, 11 per cent higher than 
the prior-year fourth quarter, as a result of increased incinerator 
sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The improvement to 
adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and 
amortization) of $1,062,677 and total comprehensive income of $750,159 
was primarily the result of nil bad debts recorded in this fourth 
quarter versus the $706,929 of bad debts recorded in the fourth quarter 
of 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prolonged downturn in
 oil and gas prices continues to impact the activity levels and capital 
spending in the oil and gas industry. There are early indications that 
oil and gas sector spending will increase in 2017; however, as activity 
is connected to commodity prices, trends cannot be predicted with 
confidence. Clients' capital constraints have caused the company to 
focus on the rental business. To that end, the company has increased 
investment in its rental fleet and in 2016 moved a significant portion 
of the Canadian fleet to Colorado, a state with stringent air quality 
legislation. The transportation costs to move the company's fleet to the
 United States in the second quarter of 2016 had an impact on the 
company's profits but enabled the company to increase its rental revenue
 in the latter part of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While continuing to meet
 demand in Canada, the company expects to continue to expand its 
presence in the United States. Colorado has been a demonstrated leader 
in effecting a reduction in harmful emissions during the same period 
where industry has increased drilling activity," said Audrey 
Mascarenhas, Questor's president and chief executive officer. "The state
 legislator has mandated the use of enclosed combustion, which has 
resulted in producers more readily gaining approval for projects from 
state and local authorities, as well as earning support from 
neighbouring residents," she added. "Questor has worked diligently at 
providing top-level service and a high-quality product that industry is 
increasingly requesting. Questor's commitment to opening an office in 
Brighton, Colo., as well as hiring local technicians, have been positive
 steps and contributing factors to our recent successes and future 
growth."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also critical to the 
success to date is the introduction and implementation of Questor's 
hybrid incineration technology, which industry has embraced in 2016. 
Initial flowback operations take place through a standard height 
incinerator. The top portion is removed after the flowback period, and 
the same incinerator, with reduced capacity due to the reduced height, 
remains to serve the needs of the production facility. This consolidates
 emissions flow through one stack and reduces equipment handling and 
costs. This solution is preferred over historical methods due to its 
increased financial efficiency for clients as they only purchase the 
incinerator capacity that they require and rent the top portion during 
the temporary well testing operation. This approach balances revenue 
between sales and rentals for Questor while providing an innovative and 
efficient operation for the company's clients reducing their well pad 
site costs. Questor is proud to be recognized and selected for its 
solutions and will continue its pursuit of earning the confidence and 
business of existing clients, as well as new customers. The company 
looks to expand its presence in Colorado with the addition of a number 
of flowback incinerators and technicians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Texas has also emerged as
 an area of significant growth with estimates of it being as much as 10 
times the activity in Colorado. This has resulted in a targeted effort 
to recruit sales representatives in key regions such as these aimed at 
expanding the company's services and equipment solutions. Questor will 
use the Colorado model to quickly set up its hub in the Texas Permian 
and the Marcellus/Utica play. This would entail a hydraulic trailer and 
four large flowback units based out of a centrally located shop and yard
 space with strong technical support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With clear requirements 
and expectations from both the federal and state agencies, the U.S. 
industry can now select equipment that serves their specific needs, 
including regulatory compliance, <b>social acceptance</b>, operating 
performance, reliability and technical support," said Audrey 
Mascarenhas, Questor's president and chief executive officer. "Questor 
will continue to commit capital to grow its revenue in states where 
producers are looking for different technologies to manage their waste 
gases and fugitive emissions," she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questor's wholly owned subsidiary Clear Power Systems Inc. (<span class="companylink">CPS</span>)
 has been aggressively marketing its waste-heat-to-power technology. 
Questor has previously provided guidance that the waste heat to power 
first sales were anticipated to already have occurred due to the 
considerable global market interest. <span class="companylink">CPS</span>
 continues to pursue opportunities in North America, including other key
 marketing collaborations. Questor remains confident the technology will
 become a profitable and growing division that offers an essential 
economic waste-heat-recovery-to-power solution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the 
SDTC-approved waste-heat-to-power project that is aimed at 
commercializing the 77-kilowatt system, Alberta Innovates has approved 
two demonstration projects: water vaporization and optimized process for
 mitigation of glycol dehydration emissions. The equipment for the water
 vaporization project was assembled and initially tested in the 
company's Grande Prairie facility during 2016. The company is looking 
forward to the next level of testing, which is expected to occur in the 
first half of 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The glycol dehydration 
emissions project has been approved for $465,000 and will demonstrate 
Questor's incineration technology as both a best-in-class control device
 for emissions, as well as a replacement technology for condensing, 
liquid storage, trucking and deep-well disposal activities. This project
 kicks off in early second quarter 2017. There are up to 4,900 operating
 glycol dehydrators in Alberta, which could utilize this solution to 
eliminate benzene emissions, reduce operating costs and generate 
greenhouse gas emission reductions at a cost of less than $1.40 per 
tonne of carbon equivalent. The greenhouse gas emission reduction 
potential of this solution for Alberta is up to 36 megatonnes, 
contributing significantly to the targets set by the provincial and 
federal governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company remains 
committed to strategic and measurable technology diversification. Heat 
to power, water vaporization and glycol dehydration emissions are all 
synergistic diversification of clean technology products and services 
that will support resource development over the long term. Recently, at 
the request and invitation of the environment agency in the United 
Kingdom, Questor presented its suite of technologies to industry and 
government. The pursuit of shale reserves in the U.K. may create an 
opportunity for the company to invest in a hub to service the U.K. 
market. Questor continues to explore areas where industry and government
 are seeking changes to traditional practices as a means to build its 
reputation and business profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The significant low 
global oil prices over the past two years have caused the company's 
customers to look for opportunities to reduce costs, defer capital 
spending and refocus on areas that are more profitable. The solutions 
that Questor is providing enable the company's customers to reduce 
costs, comply with regulations and improve the profitability of their 
operations. In the current economic environment, the option to rent the 
company's equipment is attractive to both the company's clients and 
Questor. The company has considerable financial flexibility and remains 
well positioned to react to the opportunities in the marketplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questor's audited 
consolidated financial statements, notes thereto, and management's 
discussion and analysis for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2016, and 
year-end 2016 will be available shortly on the company's website and 
through SEDAR.</p>

 Miller Williams, a carriage maker from Hamilton, Ont. and the founding 
father of Canada's petroleum industry, was drilling for water in 1858 
when he struck oil at a site known as Black Creek in southern Ontario. 
The discovery became North America's first oil well and the area was 
renamed Oil Springs. Williams went on to found The Canadian Oil Company,
 creating facilities for petroleum production, refining and 
marketing--the first integrated petroleum company on the continent.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much
 of the Canadian oil and gas industry's history is like that first 
discovery: more business acumen and incremental innovation than 
paradigm-shifting invention. "In the Canadian petroleum industry, very 
little basic research is carried on; a few companies do development 
research, while most carry out some form of application research," 
states a 1960 article in this magazine, then called Chemistry in Canada.
 Not much has changed. There were some exceptions, most notably in the 
sour (containing hydrogen sulphide) natural gas industry and the heavy 
oil/oil sands sector, where the nature of the resource necessitated 
innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The reason why our 
industry has had a slow rate of innovation relative to other industries 
is simply that experimentation, testing and evaluation are very 
expensive," says Ian Gates, a professor in the Department of Chemical 
and Petroleum Engineering, Schulich School of Engineering at the <span class="companylink">University of Calgary</span>.
 Even a field trial of new technology costs tens of millions of dollars 
and takes years to run, says Gates, who is leading a major study, titled
 Reassembling the Oilsands: Industry, Technology, Society, Environment 
and Innovation, looking into why the sector has been slow to innovate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the petrochemicals
 industry, Canada represents only about one percent of the global 
chemistry sector, says David Podruzny, vice-president of business and 
economics at the Chemistry Industry Association of Canada. Arlanxeo, a 
global synthetic rubber company headquartered in the Netherlands, does 
world-class research and development in London, Ont. NOVA Chemicals 
employs more than 300 people in Calgary doing research and development 
on plastics and chemicals. But overall, "virtually all of the key 
discoveries and developments have taken place elsewhere," Podruzny says.
 "Canada has a good reputation for development of ways to improve on 
what was discovered elsewhere."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there have been 
some firsts. In 1851, Ontario businessman Charles Nelson Tripp founded 
the International Mining and Manufacturing Company. It explored the 
asphalt beds and later the oil springs in Lambton County, Ont., for 
manufacturing oils, naphtha, paints and varnishes. Three years later, 
physician and geologist Abraham Gesner of Halifax opened his first 
plant--albeit in New York--to make keroselain, later known as kerosene. 
Gesner developed a fractional distillation method to produce the new 
synthetic lamp oil from coal, natural tar and, eventually, oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eugene Coste, an 
entrepreneur from southwestern Ontario, began drilling for natural gas 
in 1889 in Essex County, Ont., to supply nearby communities with fuel 
for lighting, heating and cooking. After moving west, his Canadian 
Western Natural Gas Company constructed a 270-kilometre pipeline from 
Bow Island, Alta., to Calgary in 1912. At the time, it was one of the 
longest and largest-diameter gas pipelines ever built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1924, the first plant 
in Canada to chemically scrub poisonous hydrogen sulphide ([H.sub.2]S) 
from sour natural gas was built in Turner Valley, Alta. But it wasn't 
until 1952 that the first plant to remove [H.sub.2]S from natural gas 
and convert it to sulphur --sold mainly for making fertilizer--was built
 at Jumping Pound west of Calgary. Joe Lukacs, then a young petroleum 
engineer and now president and CEO of Canadian Environmental Technology 
Advancement Corporation (CETAC)-WEST, worked on several of Canada's 
first sour gas-processing plants. The technology, designed and built in 
the United States, wasn't suitable for Alberta's high-[H.sub.2]S natural
 gas and the harsh winter climate, Lukacs recalls. "Everything was 
blowing up because of freezing in pipelines due to hydrate formations." 
The problem with these ice-like plugs of gas and water was solved when 
Trajan Nitescu, president of Canadian Fina Oil, had twin pipelines 
heated with glycol buried alongside the gas-gathering pipeline, while 
Lukacs and Walter Nader, a chemical and petroleum engineer at the 
University of Alberta, calculated the thermodynamics equation to make it
 work. The late Don B. Robinson, FCIC, a U of A chemical engineer, and 
his graduate student Ding-Yu Peng, FCIC, (now head of the Department of 
Chemical and Biological Engineering at the <span class="companylink">University of Saskatchewan</span>),
 subsequently developed the Peng-Robinson Equation. This mathematical 
model predicts the effects of pressure, volume and temperature on the 
behaviour of hydrocarbon-based fluids. The famous equation is still 
applied in myriad processes and industries every day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lukacs went on to form 
Western Research in Calgary, where he developed the world's first 
automated system for continuously measuring sulphur dioxide emissions 
from gas-processing plants' stacks, along with technology to automate 
the sulphur-recovery process. "Those technologies were developed in 
Alberta and they're now being used all over the world."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imperial Oil Company 
Ltd., established in 1880 when 16 Ontario oil-producing and refining 
companies merged, played a starring role in Canada's early petroleum and
 petrochemicals industries. Imperial Oil consolidated its refining 
operations in 1898 in Sarnia, Ont. The company, which had drilled 133 
wells in western Canada without finding a major new oilfield, struck a 
gusher in 1947 at its Leduc No. 1 exploratory well south of Edmonton. 
That discovery marked the birth of the modern Canadian oil and gas 
industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Canada's 
now-famous oil sands industry was developing in parallel. In 1925, more 
than a century after explorer Alexander Mackenzie saw Chipewyan natives 
using natural bitumen seeps along the Athabasca River to caulk canoes, 
Karl Clark of the <span class="companylink">Alberta Research Council</span>
 perfected a method using hot water and caustic soda to separate oil 
sands bitumen from sand. In 1964, Great Canadian Oil Sands (now part of <span class="companylink">Suncor <b>Energy</b> Inc</span>.)
 won approval for the first of the modern oil sands projects and began 
production in 1967. Its plant pioneered such processes as separating the
 lighter hydrocarbon fractions and removing asphalt and sulphur to 
produce light, low-sulphur synthetic crude oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1970s, Roger Butler, an engineer at Imperial Oil and later the first Endowed Chair in Petroleum Engineering at the <span class="companylink">University of Calgary</span>,
 invented the steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) technique. The 
method is critical for accessing the estimated 140 billion barrels of 
bitumen that are too deep to be mined from the surface--comprising about
 80 percent of Alberta's proven oil sands reserves. Using two parallel 
horizontal wells, steam is injected into the upper well and heated 
bitumen flows into the lower well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the future, Gates 
expects to see new additives such as catalysts and nanoparticles and 
so-called smart hydraulic fracturing that will increase production of 
shale oil and gas and heavy oil and bitumen while reducing <b>energy</b>,
 water use and greenhouse gas emissions. "It's about having better, more
 robust processes, not just for the technology in the ground but also 
for the regulatory and environmental assessments and the <b>social acceptance</b>."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RELATED ARTICLE: Petroleum industry is heavy economic hitter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's petroleum 
industry may have lagged historically in game-changing chemical 
innovation but its economic impact in indisputable. "Over the past five 
decades, this sector has been the lifeblood of Alberta's economy," says 
Todd Hirsch, chief economist at ATB Financial. As for the national 
economy, remember the wildfire in May 2016 that ravaged Fort McMurray in
 northern Alberta? It forced the temporary shutdown of several oil sands
 operations: <span class="companylink">Suncor <b>Energy</b></span>, <span class="companylink">Syncrude Canada</span>, <span class="companylink">Shell Canada</span>, <span class="companylink">ConocoPhillips Canada</span>, Nexen <b>Energy</b> ULC and <span class="companylink">Athabasca Oil</span>,
 knocking 1.2 million barrels a day offline, or more than 40 percent of 
provincial oil sands production. That was enough to drop Canada's real 
gross domestic product by an annualized rate of 1.6 percent during the 
second quarter, Hirsch says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Manseli, academic 
director and emeritus professor of economics at the School of Public 
Policy at the University of Calgary, says the oil and gas industry has, 
on average, accounted for about one-third of all business investment in 
the country. "It's the largest private investor in the Canadian 
economy." According to the Canadian Petroleum Producers Association, the
 industry Invested $36 billion in 2016, down from a peak of $81 billion 
in capital projects in 2014. Half of Canada's exports of goods and 
services are related to oil and gas, Manseli says.</p>

 get approval for B.C.'s $6.8-billion Trans Mountain pipeline? It had a 
secret weapon: His name is Ian Anderson, and he's just getting started</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just another day on the stump: <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada</span> president Ian Anderson prepares to defend his pipeline project during a radio interview in Vancouver</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TEAM
 OF PUBLIC-RELATIONS reps greets Ian Anderson as he strides into a 
cheerless café in the Kamloops airport. It is 9:20 a.m. on a drizzly 
Tuesday in the B.C. city, and the president of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Inc</span>.'s Canadian operations is getting ready for another day on the stump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anderson, a husky man 
dressed in a dark overcoat, slumps in a chair and nurses a coffee while 
his handlers run through the day's itinerary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past six years, 
his life has been consumed by his employer's bid to nearly triple 
shipments of oil from Alberta to the B.C. coast via its Trans Mountain 
pipeline, so he's become accustomed to the routine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“How do we refer to the 
traditional territory?" he asks. An adviser pipes up: “Secwépemc." 
Anderson repeats it, slowly, “Suh-wep-muhc."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later today, he will 
address the local chamber of commerce, and he's reminded to stick to the
 prepared script. “Just like Edmonton," a PR woman stresses—implying not
 like Vancouver, where Anderson caused a minor panic among his staff by 
suggesting humans are not responsible for climate change. He 
backtracked, but the company was forced to issue a clarification. “We're
 not talking about that stuff," Anderson confirms. “It's done. That was 
yesterday's news."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two security guards hover
 nearby. They are at Anderson's side whenever he attends an advertised 
event, in case protesters show up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I try to limit it," he 
says of the protection as he makes his way to an SUV idling in the rain.
 Still, he adds quickly, “better cautious than not."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a small but telling indication of the charged atmosphere surrounding Anderson and <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> as the U.S. infrastructure giant prepares to start construction on what has become one of the most contentious <b>energy</b>
 projects in Canadian history. Last fall, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau 
approved the $6.8-billion pipeline expansion, which would nearly triple 
capacity on <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s westbound system to 890,000 barrels a day. Boosters say the expansion will give Alberta's battered <b>energy</b>
 sector what it has long sought: wider access to global markets, 
bolstering prices and breaking a near-total dependence on a U.S. market 
that's awash in shale crude.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the project still 
faces daunting hurdles. Perhaps the biggest is a potent combination of 
environmental and aboriginal activism that has already been blamed for 
sidelining <span class="companylink">Enbridge Inc</span>.'s rival Northern Gateway pipeline. <span class="companylink">TransCanada Corp</span>.'s Keystone XL also looked doomed until Donald Trump gave it a new lease on life in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last fall, opponents temporarily halted construction of the Dakota Access pipeline. For months, Anderson and other <b>energy</b>
 executives watched with dismay as protests swelled near the prairie 
town of Cannon Ball, North Dakota, transforming the area into a de facto
 war zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many saw the 
demonstrations as a dress rehearsal for looming clashes over Trans 
Mountain. Indeed, federal Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr raised the
 spectre of a militarized showdown last fall, although he quickly 
apologized for suggesting the Canadian Forces could be deployed to quash
 dissent around the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anderson expects crews to
 start work this fall, but many observers are doubtful. Privately, some 
industry executives and analysts say it's a coin toss whether Trans 
Mountain actually gets built, citing court challenges and other 
obstacles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> must still satisfy 157 
conditions, such as habitat restoration for caribou and offsetting 
greenhouse-gas emissions associated with construction. That's fewer than
 Ottawa applied to Enbridge's rival Northern Gateway, reflecting the 
fact that the Trans Mountain proposal entails building a second pipeline
 alongside <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s current 
conduit between Edmonton and suburban Vancouver. This pre-existing 
pathway gave Trans Mountain a huge advantage over Northern Gateway, 
whose proposed route, carving through B.C.'s Great Bear Rainforest, 
enraged environmentalists and coastal First Nations. “You could be the 
Pope and you'd probably get shot down on that one," <span class="companylink">AltaCorp Capital</span>
 analyst Dirk Lever says of Gateway, which the Trudeau government 
officially killed last fall. While Enbridge's more controversial 
proposal drew some of the fire away from Trans Mountain, Lever also 
gives credit to Anderson for addressing critics' concerns up front. 
“Whatever he did, it was the right formula."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 59, Anderson has the 
polished but slightly worn look of a travelling salesman—which, in some 
respects, he is. Whereas Northern Gateway's backers were criticized for 
consulting First Nations too little and too late, Anderson estimates he 
has had 200 to 300 discussions and meetings to date. He has 
criss-crossed Western Canada pitching aboriginal groups and local 
residents on the project's economic benefits. It has paid off: As of 
mid-December, the company had signed agreements with 51 bands, covering 
the majority of the route.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deals commit <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> to providing $400-million worth of employment and financial benefits to those aboriginal groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anderson's latest gambit 
to secure support is audacious: He has offered to pay the B.C. 
government as much as $1 billion over 20 years in exchange for 
environmental clearances from the province, which piled an additional 37
 conditions on the project in January. The proposal surprised observers 
and prompted concern that <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> was setting an unwelcome precedent for big infrastructure projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal has also done 
little to mollify the pipeline's biggest critics, who fear the 
consequences of a coastal oil spill and the impact on climate change of 
oil sands' renewed expansion. These opponents include municipal leaders 
such as Derek Corrigan, mayor of Burnaby, the Vancouver suburb through 
which the last stretch of the pipeline would weave. Anderson and 
Corrigan haven't spoken in four years after the city council formally 
opposed the pipeline and litigation ensued. Anderson now calls the 
municipality Corrigan's “fiefdom."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's one more measure of 
the rancour that has enveloped the pipeline executive. Being the public 
face of the contentious project has taken a toll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent evening, 
after several meetings and a speech, Anderson's voice is hoarse and his 
eyes are ringed in dark circles. The job “just doesn't turn off," he 
says wearily, “so you just have to adjust for that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ANDERSON HAS BEEN LIVING 
and breathing the proposed expansion since at least 2010. But the roots 
of the project reach back to 2005, when <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> paid $5.6 billion (U.S.) to acquire Vancouver-based <span class="companylink">Terasen Inc</span>.
 (formerly BC Gas). For the Houston-based company, the jewel of the deal
 was a small-diameter pipeline built during the Korean War to send 
burgeoning Alberta oil production to the B.C. coast for export.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The acquisition instantly made <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> a player in the fast-growing oil sands of Northern Alberta. To this day, the pipeline is the lone conduit for Canadian oil to <b>energy</b>-thirsty Pacific markets and the big refineries in Washington State. <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 seized the potential for growth, initially committing $1.4 billion to 
expanding Trans Mountain and another Alberta oil pipeline (which it 
later sold). The investment would provide much-needed infrastructure to 
support expected growth in the oil sands, enabling the higher-cost 
barrels “to be more competitive in domestic and international markets," 
Richard Kinder, the company's billionaire founder, argued at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirteen major oil 
companies have since signed contracts to ship a combined 700,000-plus 
barrels a day through the expanded pipeline. The current plan calls for 
laying nearly 1,000 kilometres of new pipe. About 90% of the new 
pipeline will follow the existing path or other utility infrastructure 
such as power lines, the company says. But at its end, a major expansion
 looms. The company will need larger storage facilities in Burnaby to 
accommodate the additional volumes. Thirty-four tankers per month could 
sail past Vancouver's Stanley Park and under the Lions Gate Bridge to 
the company's Burnaby export dock—up from about five today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It fell to Anderson to 
execute this vision, though he initially had reservations about joining 
the company. An accountant by training, he had arrived in Calgary from 
Vancouver in late 2004 as a senior finance executive with Terasen. 
Anderson thought he was an imperfect fit for the top job at the Canadian
 branch of a company so closely associated with Texas crude. “There was a
 wee bit of nervousness in that I wasn't an oil guy," he says, seated in
 a boardroom at the company's Calgary offices during a rare lull in his 
schedule. “I hadn't spent my career in Calgary in the oil patch."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anderson grew up in 
Winnipeg—a print by Cree artist Ernie Scoles at the Calgary office hints
 at his Manitoba roots—with no particular affinity for the <b>energy</b>
 business. After graduating from the University of Winnipeg, he took a 
regulatory position with Greater Winnipeg Gas. “It was a job at the 
beginning," he says with a shrug. A big part of his role turned out to 
be steering the expansion of natural gas service to remote communities. 
That led to a role as VP of finance and regulatory affairs with Centra 
Gas—later bought by BC Gas—as it expanded service to Vancouver Island. 
At the time, natural gas was new to the island, and Anderson faced 
considerable bureaucratic and financial challenges. But he relished the 
opportunity to build a nimble operation within the confines of a heavily
 regulated power system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Living and working in 
Victoria for three years, and later in Vancouver, gave him a crash 
course on the political and cultural forces at play on the West Coast. 
He learned about the varying, and at times competing, interests among 
municipal governments, First Nations and environmentalists. For example,
 he says the lack of municipal amalgamation around Greater Victoria 
complicated efforts to build infrastructure as companies had to deal 
with multiple local city councils.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another lesson was more 
subtle but equally influential: Just about everyone had a kayak. 
“Everybody I worked with and around me had this connection to the 
outdoors and the ocean," Anderson says. It made a lasting impression on 
the native of landlocked Winnipeg, helping to shape his understanding of
 a region that in some corners remains staunchly opposed to oil-laden 
tankers plying the waterfront. “I think you can appreciate it from afar,
 but it certainly doesn't hurt to have experienced it directly," he 
says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To overcome such 
deep-seated reservations, he realized he would need to appeal directly 
to residents of tiny communities from Alberta to Vancouver Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AT TIMES OVER THE PAST 
four years, Anderson's schedule has resembled an old-time political 
barnstorming tour. Over several days last fall, his itinerary included 
stops in the Paul First Nation and Enoch Cree First Nation; visits with 
the Alexis Nakota Sioux and the Alexander First Nation in Alberta, plus 
the Simpcw and several other indigenous groups nearby in B.C. He has 
proselytized at conferences in major cities and in out-of-the-way coffee
 shops. The pace has been gruelling, with near-constant travel and 
workdays that often start before sunrise and extend into the early 
evening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conversations have 
informed the project's design, he says. For example, the company will 
drill under more roads and rivers than originally planned to lessen 
disruptions and the ecological impact of digging trenches. As a 
consequence of his travels, he can also tell you where to get the best 
meal in tiny Sooke, B.C., and jokes about his cache of coffee mugs 
stamped with chamber-ofcommerce logos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because he often eschews 
prepared notes, Anderson's spiel in public forums tends to be more 
conversational, if meandering, than is typical of executive speeches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he is not afraid to 
criticize politicians or his own industry. Such was the case when former
 federal Natural Resources minister and pipeline cheerleader Joe Oliver 
accused foreign radicals of hijacking regulatory reviews. Anderson 
publicly chastised him for needlessly sharpening opposition to major 
projects. At a Calgary speech last fall, he mused about the <b>energy</b>
 industry's inability to understand the forces aligned against it. It is
 a theme he returns to often—the need to stop finger-pointing and 
instead seek out solutions to vexing issues, be it climate change or 
aboriginal opposition to major infrastructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“These are big issues for
 our society to wrestle with, and that requires conversation, debate and
 ultimately some accommodation," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We've approached our project with that in mind: that we weren't going to be looking to others to solve our problems."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael LeBourdais, a 
former chief of the Whispering Pines/ Clinton Indian Band in B.C.'s 
Interior, can attest to Anderson's willingness to find a compromise. He 
recalls butting heads with the executive in a Vancouver hotel during 
negotiations over the pipeline back in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For LeBourdais, the 
sticking point was jurisdiction. Decades earlier, the band had been 
displaced from Clinton, B.C., owing to construction of a major hydro 
dam. LeBourdais's message to Anderson was blunt: “Don't come here and 
tell us what to do, or what you're going to do. It's my land." If their 
temperaments had been different, the enmity could have festered. 
Instead, LeBourdais and Anderson kicked the lawyers out of the room, 
leaving the two men to hash out an agreement. Le Bourdais wanted the 
company to invest in the community's youth and its elders. “And, most 
importantly, keep the oil in the damn pipe," he recalls telling 
Anderson. “And he says, ‘I want that too.' And that was the epiphany 
moment. We called our lawyers back in and said, ‘We're not going to 
litigate any more. We're negotiating.'" B.C. media mogul David Black, 
who has spent years as the chief promoter of a heavy-oil refinery on the
 province's northern coast, credits Anderson's dogged commitment to this
 type of engagement for getting the Trans Mountain project this far. “It
 isn't as simple as trying to get the permits and <b>social acceptance</b>
 to build a plant in a certain location," Black says. “You're building a
 plant that's 1,000 kilometres long, and you've got to get all those 
locations on your side."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NOT EVERYONE IS SWAYED BY
 ANDERSON'S pitch. To some, he is merely “the friendly Canadian face on 
the giant American corporation," says Ben West of the Tsleil-Waututh 
Nation Sacred Trust Initiative, which opposes Trans Mountain on behalf 
of the aboriginal group whose traditional territory spans the province's
 southern coast. Stewart Phillip, head of the Union of B.C. Indian 
Chiefs, adds that opposition to the project extends well beyond 
aboriginal communities and environmental groups. “These are 
rank-and-file British Columbians, retired people, grandparents, 
professionals who do not want to see the province suffer a catastrophic 
pipeline rupture or oil spill."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phillip and his allies 
promise a protracted fight, arguing that public hearings on the project 
were flawed because they did not subject the company's claims to oral 
cross-examination. Already, several court challenges have been filed 
seeking to overturn approvals of the project, including one claiming 
conflict of interest due to <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> and its oil-shipper customers being big donors to B.C.'s ruling Liberal Party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.C. NDP Leader John Horgan remains staunchly against it, a position he will carry into the provincial election this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2014, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 needed a court injunction to perform surveying work on Burnaby 
Mountain. The RCMP hauled away protesters in a scene that recalled the 
infamous “war in the woods" over clear-cut logging in Clayoquot Sound. 
The episode could be a prelude to more widespread demonstrations. The 
last time <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> expanded its 
pipeline was in 2007, when it started threading 160 kilometres of new 
steel partly through Alberta's Jasper National Park. The work attracted 
scant attention from activists and aboriginal groups, but this was 
before pipelines became proxies for the battle against forces blamed for
 exacerbating climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northern Gateway's demise
 has now thrust Trans Mountain into the spotlight, notes Roger Harris, a
 consultant who for two years led aboriginal engagement on Gateway as an
 Enbridge vicepresident. The Enbridge proposal was “the Darth Vader of <b>energy</b>
 projects," Harris says. “As long as Enbridge was out there, it was a 
bit of a distraction [from Trans Mountain], but once it was gone, these 
guys are the ticket. And they will draw all the attention and even more 
than what Enbridge drew." After all, the expanded Trans Mountain ends 
within walking distance of public transit connecting Vancouver to its 
suburbs, whose local governments have come out strongly against the 
project. “So it's kind of a worst-case scenario for them," says Harris.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anderson concedes that security is a concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employees at the 
company's terminal operations in Kamloops who used to quiz him about 
pensions and salaries now ask how they should cope with civil 
disobedience. The company has been gathering intelligence on opponents 
for years. That includes keeping tabs on prominent protesters and their 
movements, and monitoring what's said on social media. Anderson receives
 weekly briefings, and the company is in close contact with the RCMP and
 local police in an effort to anticipate possible scenarios once shovels
 hit the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite threats of 
blockades, Anderson insists construction will start in September. Oil 
could flow by late 2019. He deflects questions about specific threats, 
saying the project is merely entering a new chapter with new challenges.
 Trans Mountain is one of the largest capital projects <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 has ever pursued, at a time when the company is grappling with weak oil
 prices and high debt. The company's share price slumped about 65% in 
2015, though it regained some ground last year. <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 is currently hunting for a joint venture partner to help cover Trans 
Mountain's hefty price tag. It is also considering selling shares of its
 Canadian business in a public float.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stakes are high for more than just Anderson and <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>. The pipeline has become a test of the Trudeau government's implicit bargain with the <b>energy</b>
 sector: that a more stringent environmental policy, including carbon 
pricing, will make major oil projects such as Trans Mountain more 
palatable to a skeptical public. Anderson knows he'll never get everyone
 on board, yet he remains convinced that all Canadians have a stake in 
the outcome. “It's going to take a nation to build this," he says, “not 
just a company."</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Medical
 cannabis has been named among the top biggest legal risks for 
businesses in 2017, according to a report from Canada's largest law 
firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its annual report on 
key trends and regulatory changes, Borden Ladner Gervais predicts 
medical marijuana will have a major impact on businesses - such as the 
possibility of employees being stoned on the job. But that doesn't mean 
employers should freak out about it - because overreacting is also a 
risk, said Rob Weir, a partner in the law firm.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Employers
 think they will have employees stoned out of their minds. I think 
that's an overreaction," said Weir, who urges employers to look at the 
evidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, many users 
ingest medical marijuana in edible form and aren't smoking it - so 
there's no need to worry about providing smoking rooms for workers who 
use medical marijuana, as some have feared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a risk to overreact," said Weir. "That's always a risk in law."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also feels there's 
been an unreasonable amount of worrying about employees being "high" at 
work. It's fair for employers to ask that workers who use prescription 
medication are able to do their jobs safely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under human rights 
legislation, employers have a duty to accommodate employees with 
disabilities. If a worker has written communications from a doctor or 
other evidence that they must be permitted to use cannabis for medical 
purposes, an employer will have to consider the request.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether the duty to 
accommodate requires the employer to permit the worker to consume 
medical cannabis depends on a number of factors, including the nature of
 work and the impact the use of cannabis would have on productivity. 
Employers also have a duty under provincial occupational health and 
safety legislation to maintain a safe workplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the employee can't work safely, then they qualify for long-term disability, if the employer provides that, said Weir.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's too early to say how
 the issue of marijuana on the job will play out in the legal system. 
But it's also a human rights issue and employers have to understand 
their responsibility to accommodate workers, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In my view, it's completely manageable. People come to work with all kinds of medications," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also points 
out that changes to the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes 
regulations present new opportunities and challenges in health care and 
capital markets. Health care facilities could be facing a push towards 
greater acceptance of medical cannabis in their settings with the 
increasing <b>social acceptance</b> of products such as cannabis oils 
and capsules, as well as the outcome of some Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms challenges, said the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loosening legal 
framework around medical cannabis is also fuelling fast growth. The 
Canadian market is forecasted to peak at $1.1 billion by 2020, even 
without full legalization for recreational use, says the report. "The 
Canadian market for cannabis could get even hotter if the federal 
Liberals make good on their election promise to fully legalize cannabis 
for recreational use, which is widely anticipated." Other top legal 
risks on the radar for 2017:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cybersecurity and data 
privacy: Everyday devices are increasingly using microchips, sensors and
 wireless communication capabilities to collect environmental, 
behavioural and social data. Businesses should be aware that these could
 trigger privacy and data security challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shareholder activism gets ugly: In 2016, the mining and <b>energy</b>
 sectors have been targeted and activists have used "scorched earth" 
tactics that cost their targets in time, money and distraction. In 2017,
 there may be an influx of more sophisticated activists into the 
Canadian landscape, the report warns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conduct risk: The actions
 of managers or employees can cost businesses as customers, observers 
and even competitors spread information about real or imagined 
grievances. Conduct, corporate culture and ethics will be under 
increasing scrutiny, says the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The global trading 
system: The 2016 backlash against globalization has interrupted a 
30-year trend towards increased predictability in international trade 
and investment. Brexit has created uncertainty for Canadian trade and 
investment in the U.K. and the <span class="companylink">EU</span>, while Donald Trump's election brings uncertainly about bilateral trade with Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government's evolving 
management of infrastructure: The federal government is set to invest 
more than $120 billion in public infrastructure over a ten-year period, 
while Ontario has outlined plans to invest more than $137 billion over 
the same period. But there are changing and competing priorities and 
uncertainty over which projects are chosen, why, when and how, says the 
report.</p>

 to infrastructure projects - whether they be pipelines, hydro dams, 
mines or wind turbines - has become commonplace in Canada. But it's 
costing us. As part of a four-month investigation, the <span class="companylink">Financial Post</span>
 identified as many as 35 projects, worth $129 billion, that have been 
stalled or cancelled due to opposition from environmental, aboriginal 
and/or community groups. To better understand the impact, we sent

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MISTISSINI, Que. - 
Hunting grouse on a snowy road that cuts through the forest north of his
 home in the Cree community of Mistissini, Justice Debassige reflects on
 why, as a 17-year-old high school student in 2012, he started a 
petition against a uranium exploration project 215 kilometres away.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I
 read research on how it damages the land and the water, so that was 
what drew me in," he said, while searching for birds down the road 
towards the now-shuttered site owned by Boucherville, Que.-based <span class="companylink">Strateco Resources Inc</span>. "It's something to really think about when we're out here."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debassige said he 
couldn't have imagined at the time that his petition would be the 
catalyst for a complete moratorium against exploration of the 
radioactive mineral across Quebec, result in a $200-million lawsuit by <span class="companylink">Strateco Resources</span> against the government and pit the federal nuclear safety agency against a provincial environmental commission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it did, and The 
Matoush Project - named after the Cree family that traditionally use the
 land for hunting, fishing and trapping - in northern Quebec's Otish 
Mountains has lost its glow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project was part of former Quebec premier Jean Charest's Plan Nord, which had a strong focus on natural resources. Since <span class="companylink">Strateco Resources</span>' exploration began in 2006, more than $120 million has been invested in the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opposition to uranium 
mining in the province has ebbed and flowed over the years, though the 
government did grant the company some 30 permits to start work at the 
site, including permission to build an airstrip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strateco estimates the 
mine would have brought in $800 million to Quebec in taxes and royalties
 during its 10-year life, and produce the same amount of uranium as the 
entire U.S. industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's a lot of money left on the table," said Strateco's chief executive Guy Hébert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the project 
didn't have the blessing of Cree authorities in Mistissini, it wasn't 
being initially rejected either since the community of about 5,000 
people didn't want to shut the door on hundreds of potential jobs 
constructing, producing and then closing the mine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The relationship between
 Mistissini and Strateco was friendlier when it started," said Hébert, 
who began 2012 feeling optimistic about the exploration work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that was before 
Debassige and two other classmates collected about 200 signatures from 
students and staff in opposition to the project, which caught the 
attention of Shawn Iserhoff, Mistissini's youth chief at the time. He 
raised the concerns with the Mistissini Band Council and in the spring 
of 2012, Strateco arranged two days of hearings in the community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't think they knew how concerned we were and how opposed to it we were," Iserhoff said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The relationship between Mistissini and Strateco was friendlier when it started</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phil Carpenter.The 
GazetteGuy Hébert, centre, CEO of Strateco Resources, said of uranium 
mining regulataions: "There is a lot of concern and with reason. It's 
probably the safest (kind of) mine in the world because of the 
regulation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hébert said that although
 he had put other mines into production - two gold mines and one base 
metal mine - the safety measures put in place for uranium mines were 
above and beyond anything he'd done before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a lot of 
concern and with reason," he said. "It's probably the safest (kind of) 
mine in the world because of the regulation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unconvinced the mine 
wouldn't cause contamination, the band council called for a moratorium 
on any uranium exploration in the Cree territory where families in 
Mistissini still travel hundreds of kilometres to hunt, fish and trap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The traditional Cree way
 of life is based on the land," said Thomas Coon, former president of 
the Cree Trapper's Association, in an office that has a map showing how 
the entire vast territory is covered by family trap lines that are 
passed down through generations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As much as possible we try to avoid any dangerous, damaging project. With uranium, it's damage that can never be repaired."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Cree also argue that 
under the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement of 1975, they have the
 right to minimize negative environmental and social impacts of 
development in the territory even if it is designated as Crown land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hébert said that 
rejecting the Matoush project on these grounds would give the Cree de 
facto veto over any project in the territory and that other aboriginal 
communities could demand similar power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following the rocky 
hearings in Mistissini during the spring of 2012, Strateco pressed 
ahead, hoping to resolve the Cree's concerns and that October received a
 licence for underground exploration from the <span class="companylink">Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March 2013, the newly 
elected Parti Québécois government imposed a moratorium on uranium 
exploration citing a "lack of sufficient social acceptability" from the 
Cree toward the planned mine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government said it 
would not allow work to continue until it received an environmental 
review from the public hearings committee known as BAPE - the Bureau 
d'audiences publiques sur l'environnement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hébert said he was deeply
 shocked by what he considered to be a politically motivated decision, 
especially since the government only notified Strateco less than two 
hours before the public announcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Maybe at the end Matoush
 would not have been economical or profitable," he said. "We spent $140 
million without knowing at the end whether it was a project or not."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April 2013, the 
company announced it would sue Quebec for $16 million to compensate it 
for the money Hébert said was lost while waiting for the government to 
decide whether to give the company the green light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Months later, Quebec's 
then environment minister refused to grant Strateco the certificate it 
needed to begin advanced exploration phase of the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That decision is based on no scientific fact," Hébert said, and the company filed a motion in December 2013 to invalidate it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said many of the 
company's nearly 3,000 shareholders come from outside Canada and 
invested in Quebec because it was supposed to have a government 
supportive of natural resource development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cayman Islands-based 
private equity firm The Sentient Group, Toronto-based boutique 
investment management firm Goodman &amp; Co., and <span class="companylink">Bank of Nova Scotia</span> were Strateco's three biggest shareholders in 2013, according to Bloomberg data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People were investing 
with a lot of confidence," Hébert said. "In Quebec, you should have the 
right to go to the end and try to make money with your investment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Strateco's stock 
plummeted, anti-uranium activism grew in both the Cree and environment 
organizations. A group of Cree youth garnered media attention in late 
2014 by walking 850 kilometres from Mistissini to Montreal and the 
movement also drew support from the global anti-nuclear activists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As much as possible we try to avoid any dangerous, damaging project. With uranium, it's damage that can never be repaired</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Groupe CNWIn 2014 a group of Cree marched 850 kilometres to protest against uranium development in their territory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the tide of public 
sentiment turned against the project, Strateco sued the Quebec 
government on Dec. 11, 2014, for $190 million to recover the loss on its
 investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July 2015, BAPE 
presented its 600-page report to the provincial government. Based on 250
 written submissions and dozens of public meetings, it concluded that 
allowing uranium development now would be "premature," because of 
uncertainty around the health and environmental risks of uranium mining 
and the waste that remains radioactive for thousands of years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission</span>
 slammed the report, saying uranium can be mined without the radiation 
causing damage such as increased rates of cancer or poisoning the 
wildlife in the area, and that every type of natural resource produces 
waste that needs to be effectively managed well into the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Uranium mining in Canada
 is a well-regulated industry which poses no unreasonable risks to 
people or the environment," the commission said in an email to the <span class="companylink">Financial Post</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Moratoriums cannot be 
supported with claims that uranium mines pose a risk to the public; if 
managed and regulated properly, they do not. Issues of <b>social acceptance</b> of nuclear or uranium should not be confused with scientific facts."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the <span class="companylink">MiningWatch Canada</span>
 advocacy group argues uranium's current lack of social acceptability is
 based on the long-term risks of storing millions of tonnes of the 
radioactive mining waste.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If the industry can show
 that they can handle the waste with a risk factor that is acceptable, 
maybe the social acceptability will change in the future, but at the 
moment it's not there," said Ugo Lapointe, spokesperson for MiningWatch 
in Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strateco is now preparing
 to take the provincial government to the Quebec Superior Court on Jan. 
9, 2017 for a 25-day trial and has upped the damages to $200 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I would be surprised that
 someone would be able to raise capital right now to develop a uranium 
project until you know how this project will be settled</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tyler Anderson/National PostThe sun rises over Lac Mistassini's Baie du Poste near Mistissini in northern Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the third time 
the company has taken legal action over the Matoush project and Hébert 
said he believes Strateco has a strong case that may eventually go to 
the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mistissini Band 
Council declined to comment because its members are intervening in the 
lawsuit to explain their opposition to uranium and don't want to 
negatively affect the case by speaking to the media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All I can say is that we stand by our position," Chief Richard Shecapio said in a phone interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although there are 
uranium-mining moratoriums in British Columbia, Nova Scotia and the U.S.
 state of Virginia, other jurisdictions, including Greenland, 
Queensland, Australia and Newfoundland and Labrador, have lifted the 
bans they once had in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nochane Rousseau, mining industry group leader for Quebec at <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span>, said it would be difficult to even consider uranium exploration in Quebec until Strateco's litigation is resolved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I would be surprised 
that someone would be able to raise capital right now to develop a 
uranium project until you know how this project will be settled," 
Rousseau said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It certainly doesn't help
 that the Matoush Project is apparently over. Hébert said the camp is 
shut down and its employees laid off. Strateco, too, will close its 
doors for good once the lawsuit is resolved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of people have been burned by Strateco and they just want to know what will come out of it," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debassige, now 22, won a 
Nuclear-Free Future Award in 2015 on behalf of the Mistissini youth for 
his efforts against uranium development on Cree land. Today, bringing 
home two birds he shot for his family's dinner, he still doesn't think 
the potential economic benefits of uranium mining are worth risking what
 he and his community already have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's vast open space

Ms. Audrey Mascarenhas reports</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">INCREASED RENTAL REVENUE DRIVES POSITIVE CASH FLOW AND THIRD QUARTER 2016 FINANCIAL RESULTS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questor Technology Inc</span>. today released 
its operating and financial results for the three months ended Sept. 30,
 2016, and the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weak commodity price 
environment continues to persist through 2016. "Despite the challenging 
operating environment, Questor generated positive operating cash flow 
for the quarter, and we continue to maintain our balance sheet 
comprising strong cash balances and no debt," said Audrey Mascarenhas, 
president and chief executive officer of Questor. "Looking forward, we 
are positive about the markets we serve, and are confident that our 
customer relationships and business model position us to manage through 
this cycle. We remain focused on diversifying the Questor platform, and 
we will continue to execute on market opportunities to support this 
strategy. In response to regulations and demand for our equipment in 
Colorado, we have deployed additional mobile rental units to the state, 
and strengthened our operations to meet demand for regulated closed loop
 completions or green completions."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questor has recently 
received a purchase order for a number of incinerators for deployment in
 the state of Colorado during the fourth quarter of 2016. Development 
and deployment of the new hybrid model incinerator serve both rental and
 sales sectors, resulting in a blend of revenue. These new unit sales 
for production facility equipment are significant as they allow Questor 
to provide emission control for wells right from the initial flow back 
period through the duration of their production life. Questor is proud 
to have been selected for both of these types of applications, and will 
continue its pursuit of earning the confidence and business of existing 
clients, as well as new customers. Questor continues to invest in waste 
heat to power and has added two distributors while actively marketing 
this <b>energy</b> efficient technology. The company constructed the 
water vaporization prototype in Grande Prairie during the quarter, 
advancing another important technology that Questor is eager to 
commercialize.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three months ended in the third quarter of 2016 versus the third quarter of 2015</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue for the quarter 
was consistent with the prior year. The company continues to experience 
declines in revenue as result of lower activity and constraints on 
capital spending in the North American oil and gas sector due to 
depressed oil and gas prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Incinerator sales were 
most significantly impacted, decreasing 41 per cent from the prior year.
 In addition to the severe impact on industry cash flow driven by low 
commodity prices, some customers are preserving capital rather than 
seeking to increase production into a declining commodity cycle. In 
Canada, clients that typically purchased units are renting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue from incinerators
 rentals during the three months ended Sept. 30, 2016, increased 59 per 
cent versus the same period of 2015. The increase is primarily due to 
new large projects in the U.S. region that commenced during the third 
quarter of 2016. Depressed oil and gas prices continue to effect capital
 constraints; as a result, Questor is experiencing significant interest 
in incinerator rentals as an alternative to incinerator sales. The 
company expects demand for incinerator rentals will increase through the
 fourth quarter of 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross profit increased 57
 per cent from the prior year. The increase in gross profit was the 
result of two primary factors: higher rental revenue mix, and lower 
repair and maintenance costs incurred than the prior year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjusted EBITDA (earnings
 before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) increased 100 
per cent from the prior year due to higher gross profits and foreign 
exchange. The Canadian-dollar-versus-U.S.-dollar exchange fluctuations 
during the third quarter of 2016 resulted in a small, unrealized foreign
 exchange gain versus unrealized foreign exchange losses in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nine months ended in the third quarter of 2016 versus the third quarter of 2015</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue for this period 
was 20 per cent lower than the prior year. Incinerator sales again were 
most significantly impacted, decreasing 32 per cent from the prior year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue from incinerators
 rentals during the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2016, increased 4 per 
cent versus the same period of 2015. The increase was primarily due to 
two longer-term projects in the United States, which commenced during 
the third quarter of 2016. Depressed oil and gas prices continue to 
affect capital constraints; as a result, Questor is experiencing 
significant interest in incinerator rentals as an alternative to 
incinerator sales. The company expects demand for incinerator rentals 
will continue to increase through the four quarter of 2016. Questor has 
invested over $1-million during the period expanding the U.S. 
incinerator rental fleet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross profit decreased 33
 per cent from the prior year. The decrease in gross profit was the 
result of three factors: lower revenue, incremental operational costs at
 the waste-heat-to-power fabrication division, new equipment 
mobilization costs, and incremental repairs and maintenance costs on the
 incinerator rental units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operations expenses 
increased as Questor incurred incremental expenses in the incinerator 
rental division and at the Florida waste-heat-to-power fabrication 
facility. Questor's heat-to-power technology continues to move forward. 
The waste-heat-to-power sector is emerging as an area with enormous 
potential and reach. While it is premature to discuss specific 
opportunities, the company has recognized serious interest in its 
product in a variety of industries, including oil and gas. The addition 
of this technology to Questor will help it further diversify across a 
number of markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company recorded a 
loss of $689,131 (three-cent loss per share), down from a profit of 
$487,647 (two-cent profit per share) in the prior year. The decrease in 
profit was a cumulative effect of the factors discussed above.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outlook</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prolonged downturn in
 oil and gas prices continues to decrease the activity levels and 
capital spending in the oil and gas industry in 2016, and the company 
remains focused managing through the current industry downturn. The 
company believes the <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span>'s
 target to reduce methane emissions by 45 per cent by 2025 will create 
an opportunity for the company. Questor believes that the clean 
technology industry will become an integral component of resource 
development, and the company is well positioned given its focus on 
top-tier service, quality, logistics management and technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent global focus 
on emissions and the commitments in Paris at COP21 to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions (GHG) over concern with climate change is also anticipated
 to have an impact on the company's clients. The governments of Canada 
and the United States recently issued a joint statement committing to 
reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40 per cent to 
45 per cent below 2012 levels by 2025. To implement this commitment, the
 Canadian federal government will introduce regulations to reduce 
methane emissions from the oil and gas sector to address venting and 
fugitive emissions. The Canadian requirements will cover emissions from 
the same sources, subject to current and proposed U.S. regulatory 
requirements, and will require reductions from some unique Canadian 
sources, such as heavy oil. Implementation of a carbon tax is being 
contemplated both federally and provincially.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is recognized that the
 U.S. election may have caused some concerns as to the extent of 
continuing and future demand for Questor's emission reduction equipment.
 Questor believes that, regardless of the U.S. policy or commitment on 
greenhouse gas emissions reduction, the its technology will continue to 
be in demand. The company's incinerator technology performs at the 
highest level and is consistent with global emissions reduction 
initiatives, such as COP 21. Colorado seeks the company's equipment in 
order to develop industrially in close proximity to landowners while 
earning their approval. The strong and increasing demand in Colorado is 
firmly based on addressing social issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In this challenging 
economic environment, our clients in Canada will be looking for 
technology solutions that are reliable, reduce operating costs, are cost
 effective, have a track record and are proven. Cleanly combusting 
methane using Questor's technology solutions will reduce GHG emissions 
nine-fold at a cost of less than $3 per tonne, or two cents per thousand
 cubic feet, because the global warming potential of methane is 25 times
 that of CO2 over a hundred-year period. Therefore, venting or 
inefficient combustion of methane increases the greenhouse gases 
emitted," said Ms. Mascarenhas, Questor's president and CEO.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The State of Colorado has
 taken a lead role in regulating quality, high performance emission 
control equipment, and the industry in this area is now including 
Questor's style of combustion devices in its planning for well bore flow
 back periods and its production life. For the past 30 months, Questor 
has been providing rental incineration to this market on a rental basis 
for a variety of clients. Questor has worked diligently at providing 
top-level service and a high-quality product that the industry has 
noticed, and inquiries have increased substantially. Questor's 
commitment to opening an office in Brighton, Colo., as well as hiring a 
local technician have been positive steps and contributing factors to 
its recent successes and future growth. The company is well positioned 
to create additional operating hubs with rental equipment in other 
locations as the opportunities arise. Questor is experiencing 
significant interest in incinerator rentals as an alternative to 
incinerator sales. This confirms to management that it is vital to 
continue to market and grow the rental fleet as it is emerging as a more
 capital-efficient option than purchasing. The company expects demand 
for incinerator rentals will remain strong and further increase into 
2017. In addition, Questor anticipates incinerator sales in the U.S. 
will increase to address combustion requirements at production 
facilities, after the rental flow back period. Strengthened regulations 
in the U.S. have caused an increased demand for Questor's technology. 
The <span class="companylink">United States Environmental Protection Agency</span> (<span class="companylink">EPA</span>)
 issued regulations to reduce harmful air pollution arising out of crude
 oil and natural gas industry activities with a particular focus on the 
efficient destruction of volatile organic compounds and hazardous air 
pollutants, and has recently introduced methane emission reduction 
legislation. "Questor's has a unique ability to address air quality 
issues associated with tank and gas dehydration emissions in a 
cost-effective way meeting the new standards. The superior performance 
of Questor's products and demonstrated operational success has led 
certain customers to specify the company's equipment as a best 
practice," said Ms. Mascarenhas. Questor will continue to monitor the 
regions where regulations are enforced, or becoming enforceable, and 
ensure that its sales efforts match appropriately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While continuing to meet 
demand in Canada, the company expects to continue to expand its presence
 in the United States. With stringent regulations imposed by the <span class="companylink">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</span>
 that require performance testing for incinerators and other stacks that
 burn waste gas, it is expected that the demand for better equipment 
will increase. Each state may have additional requirements that reflect 
some of the unique and specific needs that extend beyond the <span class="companylink">EPA</span>'s requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With clear requirements 
and expectations from both the federal and state agencies, the industry 
can now select equipment that serves its specific needs, including 
regulatory compliance, <b>social acceptance</b> operating performance, 
reliability and technical support. Questor will continue to commit 
capital to grow its revenue in states where producers are looking for 
different technologies to manage their waste gases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta government 
has released the new climate change policy. The policy opens 
opportunities for Questor to provide high-efficiency combustion and 
heat-to-power technologies solutions. The opportunities range from 
methane emissions reductions to replacing coal-powered electricity with 
electrical power generated from waste heat. Questor's solutions are 
ideal for this policy's targets as they enable customers to reduce 
costs, comply with regulations and improve the profitability of their 
operations. Further policy changes require small emitters under 100,000 
tonnes per year of carbon dioxide equivalent to aggregate their 
facilities. The aggregation may result in the same level of compliance 
required by large emitter (greater than 100,000 tonnes per year of 
carbon dioxide). Questor has developed solutions that have meaningful 
impact on emissions reductions for smaller facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questor's wholly owned 
subsidiary, Clear Power Systems Inc., has been aggressively marketing 
the waste-heat-to-power technology. Questor has previously provided 
guidance that the waste-heat-to-power first sales were anticipated to 
already have occurred. The projects are still active, but the clients 
have not finalized decisions at this time. There is considerable global 
market interest in the Clear Power solution. The company continues to 
make significant progress and gain confidence in its technology. <span class="companylink">CPS</span> is pleased to announce the appointment of two new distributors: Inner Point <b>Energy</b> of Kirkwood and IHR <b>Energy</b> ApS of Norway. Inner Point is a company that focuses on renewable waste to <b>energy</b>, gasifiers to produce syngas and behind-the-fence power. <span class="companylink">CPS</span>
 continues to pursue opportunities in the U.S. and is also seeking other
 key marketing collaborations. Questor remains confident the technology 
will become a profitable division that offers an essential economic 
waste-heat-recovery-to-power solution. Questor continues to be 
identified as an innovator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta Innovates has 
recently approved two demonstration projects: water vaporization and 
glycol dehydration emissions. The equipment for the water vaporization 
project is currently being assembled in the company's Grande Prairie 
facility, and Questor looks to demonstrate this project in the fourth 
quarter of this year. The glycol dehydration emissions project has been 
approved for $475,000 and will demonstrate Questor's incineration 
technology as both a best-in-class control device for emissions, as well
 as a replacement technology for condensing, liquid storage, trucking 
and deep-well disposal activities. There are approximately 4,000 
operating glycol dehydrators in Alberta which could utilize this 
solution to eliminate benzene emissions, reduce operating costs and 
generate greenhouse gas emission reductions at a cost of less than $1.40
 per tonne. The greenhouse gas emission reduction potential of this 
solution for Alberta is approximately 36 million tonnes, contributing 
significantly to the targets set by the provincial and federal 
governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company remains 
committed to strategic and measurable technology diversification. 
Waste-heat-to-power, water vaporization and glycol dehydration emissions
 are all synergistic diversification of clean technology products and 
services that will support resource development over the long term. 
Recently, at the request and invitation of the <span class="companylink">Environment Agency</span>
 in the United Kingdom, Questor presented its suite of technologies to 
the industry and government. Questor continues to explore areas where 
the industry and government are seeking changes to traditional practices

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Questor's 
long-term strategy has not changed, in the short to medium term, the 
company remains focused on one thing: managing through the industry 
downturn. Since Questor's inception, the company has experienced several
 business cycles, and management understands how to adapt its focus 
through a downturn. Key focal points include managing the company's cost
 structure, employing further process efficiencies, retaining key staff,
 maintaining strong relationships with its existing customers, as well 
as expanding its customer base, all while ensuring the company has 
sufficient liquidity to navigate the cyclical downturn. The company's 
U.S. operations continue to generate strong cash contributions and 
provide an avenue for growth. Questor believes that the clean technology
 industry will remain an integral component of resource development over
 the long term, and that the company will be well positioned given its 
focus on top-tier service, quality, logistics management and technology.
 These qualities are particularly important during downturns.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How did <b>energy</b> 
projects in Canada become so controversial? Public protests over 
pipelines and hydraulic fracturing have become common-place, and the <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span> has had record numbers of intervenors in pipeline hearings.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One
 might be tempted to lay the blame at Stephen Harper for calling 
pipelines “no-brainers” and giving the impression that pipelines such as
 Northern Gateway would be approved no matter what. But the controversy 
and debate around <b>energy</b> projects spans much more than pipelines.
 One only has to look at the discussion of hydraulic fracturing in 
Eastern and Atlantic Canada to realize that fossil fuel development is 
not generally accepted. Opposition are not limited to fossil fuels; 
renewables such as wind are equally contentious, with protests in 
Ontario and Quebec. And let’s not forget the controversy over the Site C
 hydro dam in B.C. — protest groups have given an ultimatum that the 
government must choose between LNG exports and Site C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Politicians of all 
stripes across the country have latched onto the idea of “social 
licence” — an amorphous concept that suggests <b>energy</b> projects 
need not only regulatory approval but also approval from society. Rachel
 Notley used the idea of social licence to link getting pipelines built 
with Alberta’s Climate Leadership Plan. In Nova Scotia, the government 
named having a social licence in place as one of the conditions for 
lifting the moratorium on hydraulic fracturing. Justin Trudeau stated it
 was necessary for <b>Energy</b> East to proceed. Tom Mulcair claimed 
pipeline projects “will not obtain the social licence they require 
without having a rigorous review process in place to ensure 
environmental sustainability, community partnership and long-term 
prosperity of our economic development.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This issue has become such a prominent part of the discussion around <b>energy</b> projects that Trudeau has initiated a review of federal <b>energy</b> and environmental regulation, citing the need to restore trust and confidence in both. As well, the <b>Energy</b> and Mines Ministers’ Conference — the annual gathering of federal, provincial and territorial ministers responsible for <b>energy</b>
 and mining portfolios — convened a working group on public confidence 
in advance of their August 2016 meeting in Winnipeg. There is even a 
report with different case studies on “building public confidence” in 
mining and <b>energy</b> projects, which aims to describe the role of government in public confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What do the concepts of “social licence” and “public confidence” mean for <b>energy</b>
 projects and their regulators in Canada? This is the question I explore
 with my co-authors — an interdisciplinary collaboration of academics 
from across Canada — in a white paper published by the University of 
Calgary’s School of Public Policy in May 2016. We explore the origins of
 the term “social licence” and related concepts, and offer three 
perspectives on the state of <b>energy</b> regulation in Canada — broken, not broken, and can be improved. These led to eight recommendations for improving <b>energy</b>
 policy and regulation in Canada. Here, I focus on three of the 
recommendations that, in my opinion, are the most helpful for improving <b>energy</b> policy and regulation in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of white paper, 
we provide a comprehensive literature review of the origins of “social 
licence”: the idea has its roots in the mining sector and corporate 
environmental performance more broadly. The concept of <b>social acceptance</b>, on the other hand, originated in the development of renewable <b>energy</b>
 technologies. Both terms have a common element: the idea of legitimacy,
 that the actions of an entity are viewed as appropriate or desirable, 
and have support from stakeholders, the general public, opinion leaders 
and government officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comparing these concepts to the current debate about <b>energy</b> use and <b>energy</b>
 sources in Canada, we argue that the idea of social licence is no 
longer a useful concept, having broadened in scope so much that its 
meaning has become “unclear, amorphous and confusing.” Moreover, we 
recommend that whenever regulators, policy-makers or politicians use 
terms such as “social licence,” “acceptance,” “support” or “public 
confidence” they do so carefully, with a clear explanation of their 
interpretation of the term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relatedly, we discuss the extent to which the public can and should be involved in <b>energy</b>
 discussions and regulatory hearings. We note that regulators are often 
placed in a difficult position of determining who can have standing in 
the hearing of an <b>energy</b> project, given the regulator’s mandate 
and the scope of the project. Developing clear standards for identifying
 hearing participants that are consistent across jurisdictions will help
 build legitimacy in regulatory processes. The Canadian <b>Energy</b> Strategy is a natural place to implement this policy change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key issue in the legitimacy of regulatory processes, and in the current <b>energy</b>
 debate in Canada, is the scope of regulatory hearings. For practical 
and statutory reasons, the scope of topics for determining whether a 
project is in the public interest is limited; this creates frustration 
for Canadians with concerns outside of a regulator’s or hearing’s 
mandate. This is a clear policy gap, as there is limited scope for 
Canadians to engage with policy-makers beyond regulatory hearings. We 
recommend <b>energy</b> regulators should report recurring concerns 
beyond their mandate to policy-makers, as this information can and 
should be used to help Canadians speak back to policy-makers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of the day, Canadians appear to be caught up in a “great <b>energy</b> debate” — about where our <b>energy</b> comes from, how we use it, and what the future of <b>energy</b> use will be in Canada. It behooves our provincial and federal governments to adjust <b>energy</b>
 policy and regulation to ensure there is an outcome, rather than 
endless debate. While the Trudeau government’s modernization plan for 
the <span class="companylink">NEB</span> is a start, it should not be 
considered a silver bullet, as our current debate is much deeper and 
more complex than the regulation of interprovincial pipelines. The white
 paper provides recommendations for improving trust in and legitimacy of
 <b>energy</b> regulation in Canada, which is something all levels of government should strive for.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representatives from the <b>energy</b> industry and environmental advocacy groups at <b>Energy</b>
 Dialogues LLC's North American Gas Forum agreed that promise and 
challenges fill the future of natural gas, which is in great supply in 
the U.S. and in great demand in countries looking to back up renewable <b>energy</b> sources or reduce the use of coal in pursuit of economic and environmental benefits.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a huge opportunity for natural gas … if natural gas is viewed correctly as a clean <b>energy</b> source," Richard Newell, president of Resources for the Future, said in an Oct. 4 panel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All the boxes are 
checked," Newell said. Conventional air pollution from gas combustion is
 already low, he said. Gas is a great substitute for coal, especially if
 the methane emissions are controlled, he said. Gas can be coupled with 
carbon capture and carbon storage, as shown by pilot projects in Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If that carbon is 
sequestered in the ground, natural gas can be a zero-emitter," according
 to Newell, a former administrator of the U.S. <b>Energy</b> Information Administration. "I really believe that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shale gas added about 20 
Bcf/d of incremental production to the U.S. total over the last four 
years, primarily from the Marcellus formation, Berkeley Research Group 
Director Tom Choi observed the day before. Yet most Americans either do 
not know or do not care about the country's <b>energy</b> successes, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this gas can work 
well with renewables, said Ben Ratner, director of corporate 
partnerships for the Environmental Defense Fund. His group is trying to 
make sure market processes and <span class="companylink">FERC</span> rules work to provide a "package solution."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ratner urged the industry
 and its trade associations to rethink their approaches. Groups that 
represent the long-term interests of gas companies should "take a 
modernized, forward-leaning, collaborative approach that includes 
accelerating the sharing of best practices, catalyzing technology 
development and innovation on these legitimate risks and challenges, and
 coming to the table — or at least not interfering with some of their 
more forward-thinking operators — to develop the public policies of the 
future that not only the planet needs, but are so critical to establish 
trust [with the public]," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some major industry players support the idea of collaboration. Michael Crothers, president of <span class="companylink">Shell Canada Ltd</span>.
 and vice president of North American unconventionals business at Royal 
Dutch Shell plc's Shell Upstream Americas, encouraged other members of 
the industry to build relationships and respond to public concerns and 
feedback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The world needs all the <b>energy</b>
 it can get, from all different forms, and gas is going to be a key part
 of that," Crothers told the forum's largely industry-based crowd. "The 
way to enable that to happen is to continue to build trust. Get out 
there. Build relationships. Put more emphasis within your organizations 
on <b>social acceptance</b>."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Secondly, build your 
credibility by aligning with environmental groups, with academics and 
with government to actually create the momentum and make it easy for 
politicians to agree and move us forward as a society," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"And third, keep thinking
 global," he said, "because gas has a huge role to play in managing 
global greenhouse gases, not just in continental North America."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Shell</span> and other oil and gas companies have worked with <span class="companylink">Environmental Defense Fund</span> and other environmental groups. <span class="companylink">Shell</span> supports the "Rational Middle <b>Energy</b> Series," a group of short films that cover <b>energy</b> and environmental issues by Director and Producer Gregory Kallenberg, who moderated the forum panel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sarah Sandberg, COO at 
the Colorado Oil and Gas Association, summed it up for the industry 
executives. "You're at the table or you're on the menu," she said. 
"Choose to be part of the solution. It's tough work, but it's our 
responsibility to do it."</p>

forecast the global legal marijuana market to grow at an astounding CAGR
 of more than 37% during the forecast period, according to their latest 
report.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 research study covers the present scenario and growth prospects of the 
global legal marijuana market for 2016-2020. To calculate the market 
size, the report considers the revenue generated from legal sales of 
marijuana. It also presents the vendor landscape of the top six vendors 
in the market along with listing down the other prominent vendors in the
 market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marijuana, one of the 
premium variants of cannabis, is used for recreational (psychoactive 
drugs) and medicinal purposes. Usage of marijuana for recreational 
purpose is expected to increase significantly over the forecast period, 
which in turn, can lead to increase in the global demand for marijuana. 
Vendors are introducing different products like marijuana-based tablets 
and topical applications to propel the sale of marijuana. In 2015, the 
market generated the major part of its revenue from the sales of 
marijuana through retail and convenience stores. Medicinal marijuana 
refers to the use of cannabis and cannabinoids for treating chronic pain
 and spasms in patients. The adoption of cannabis for diverse medical 
purposes have rapidly grown during the period 2013-2015. The legal 
medicinal marijuana market accounted for 75.26% of total marijuana 
market in 2015.</p>

entertainment analysts highlight the following four factors that are 
contributing to the growth of the global legal marijuana market: </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">   -- Technological advances in multiple domains of market 
 
   -- Premium pricing due to high <b>energy</b> consumption in marijuana production 
 
   -- Rising <b>social acceptance</b> of marijuana and growing business opportunities 
 
   -- Increasing business sophistication </pre>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technological advances in multiple domains of market</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ujjwal Doshi, a lead 
media and entertainment services analyst at Technavio, says, 
"Technological advances in all these operations coupled with the 
millennial generation's preference for marijuana for recreational 
purposes is expected to have a huge impact on the market's growth. With 
the increasing legalization of marijuana during the forecast period, it 
is important for vendors to engage with their customers, increase the 
production capacity and to comply with the legality of marijuana use in 
various countries."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premium pricing due to high <b>energy</b> consumption in marijuana production</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The production of marijuana in in-house conditions is an extremely <b>energy</b>
 intensive process. In 2015, the electricity consumption accounted for 
0.85% of the electricity output in countries where marijuana is legal. 
Electricity is mainly used to maintain optimal growing conditions for 
the plants like the generation of intense heat through indoor 
cultivation lights and operation of ventilation, cooling, and humidity 
management systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prohibition and 
strict penalties imposed on the cultivation of marijuana have also 
considerably increased the selling price, which allows the vendors to 
recoup their costs on <b>energy</b> investments and maintain high-profit margins. Vendors are not very motivated to increase the <b>energy</b> efficiency of their operations because customers are willing to pay any premium amount to get the product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising <b>social acceptance</b> of marijuana and growing business opportunities</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growth of the 
marijuana market has significantly increased the revenue for dispensary 
owners as well as cultivators and governments. In addition, the growing 
popularity of marijuana for recreational purpose is increasing the 
market competition and business opportunity for several vendors. 
Ancillary businesses such as cannabis oil market, hookah parlors, 
bubblers, volcano vaporizers and percolated bongs, THC-infused ice 
cream, and brownies are also profiting from the growing legal marijuana 
market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increasing business sophistication</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With more vendors 
entering the market, marijuana market is growing out of the 
emerging-business phase. The increased competition is expected to 
squeeze the profit margins which will result in the mid-stage companies 
refining their strategies," adds Ujjwal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The global marijuana 
industry is expected to grow rapidly during the forecast period with the
 focus shifting from developing operational standards of manufacturing 
marijuana to enhancing strategic priorities, including marketing and 
target areas. The importance of business intelligence is growing in all 
industries, including marijuana market. It will play a significant role 
in the marijuana market's growth as data-driven decision gain 
prominence. Decisions regarding retail location, pricing decisions, and 
product mixes will not be more empirical and not driven by instinct and 
anecdote.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don’t know about all y’all, but I’m wondering when the social licence shows up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Social licence” is a term, never too carefully defined, for broad <b>social acceptance</b>
 of some big change. It came into vogue in the late years of Stephen 
Harper’s government to explain why he couldn’t get oil pipelines built 
even though he was the country’s biggest fan of oil pipelines.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 answer came, not (or not only) from implacable Harper opponents or from
 people who could not tolerate the notion of oilsands development and 
oil exports, that Harper was going about this business wrong. By making 
himself big oil’s pal, Harper was alienating indigenous groups, 
environmentalists, U.S. presidents and, just in general, the neighbours.
 These groups could then, in various ways, deny pipeline projects the 
“social licence” they would need to proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This line came, for 
instance, from Jim Prentice in several speeches and articles after he 
left Harper’s government and before he became premier of Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And more important, it 
was part of the sales pitch for two governments now serving in Canada: 
Rachel Notley’s provincial NDP government in Alberta, and Justin 
Trudeau’s federal government in Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our government will 
boost exports by seeking out new relationships, strengthening old ones 
and enhancing Alberta’s environmental record,” Notley told a business 
group soon after becoming Alberta premier in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years before that, 
launching his campaign for the federal Liberal leadership, Trudeau spoke
 to the Calgary Petroleum Club. “If we had stronger environmental policy
 in this country — stronger oversight, tougher penalties, and yes, some 
sort of means to price carbon pollution — then I believe the Keystone XL
 pipeline would have been approved already,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Social licence is more 
important than ever,” he added. “Governments may be able to issue 
permits, but only communities can grant permission.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I belabour all this 
ancient history because on Thursday more than 50 indigenous nations 
across North America formed a “treaty alliance” against oilsands 
development. The group is officially opposed to any new pipeline 
project, including one Trudeau has said he favours: <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>’s Trans Mountain project in British Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The indigenous groups 
have vowed to back their words with action. “They pledge to “resist the 
use of our respective territories and coasts in connection with the 
expansion of the production of the Alberta tarsands, including for the 
transport of such expanded production, whether by pipeline, rail or 
tanker . . . .”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National party leaders 
have had a fun couple of years declaring which projects they support and
 which they oppose. Trudeau liked Keystone XL, which has seemed dead 
since U.S. President Barack Obama declined permission for the pipeline 
shortly after last year’s Canadian federal election. He often says nice 
things about Trans Mountain. No matter. The indigenous groups are in the
 business of shutting down all pipeline projects in every direction. 
They want to ensure “that the tarsands are not able to escape by another
 pipeline route and thereby cripple efforts to fight the climate 
crisis.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These groups, like every 
environmental lobby worth the name, seem unswayed by the prospect of a 
national Canadian carbon price at some not-too-distant point in the 
future. They seem unconvinced, and it’s no wonder, by the very mixed 
results the Trudeau government has had in attempting to reform the <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether you feel good or 
bad about the near-total collapse of any chance that oil will find its 
way to market through new pipelines anytime soon will depend on your 
feelings about oilsands oil and climate change. But it’s not great news 
for Trudeau and Notley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their selling proposition was that, by treating <b>energy</b>
 and the environment and First Nations and communities less menacingly 
than Harper did, they could get better results. It was part of their 
selling proposition in the 2015 elections, and if it is demonstrated to 
be false it will undermine their appeal when they try to win again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One wonders how much longer Trudeau, in particular, will keep standing around watching all his efforts on <b>energy</b>
 exports collapse. “We need national leadership that will make a clear, 
positive case about what is in our national interest,” he told the 
Petroleum Club in 2013. If he had the big job, he said then, he’d have 
“joined and contributed to . . . efforts to build a national <b>energy</b> strategy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has the job now, and 
the opponents of the projects Trudeau says he favours are not wasting 
time. His move now — if he has one.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MERCEDES STEPHENSON: Time
 for our week-ending strategy session with political commentator Gerry 
Nicholls coming to us from downtown Toronto; in Regina, we have sally 
Housser, a senior consultant with Navigator; and with me in studio, Greg
 MacEachern with <span class="companylink">Environics Communications</span>
 . Well we promoed this before the break, so let's start with it, Sally.
 The NDP meltdown continues, Alexandre Boulerice saying that he will not
 seek the leadership. He is certainly not the first and probably won't 
be the last prominent NDP MP to say he is not interested. It seems that 
there is a real dearth of strong candidates. What do you attribute that 
to, Sally?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SALLY
 HOUSSER (Navigator Ltd): Well, first of all I argue that there's not 
enough strong candidates. I think there's some interesting names that 
have been floated around. I know I have heard of Jagmeet Singh, a 
tremendously popular MLA in Ontario and deputy premier. I've heard 
people talk about Mike Layton. Charlie Angus is another name that keeps 
popping up. Niki Ashton of course who ran last time. But I think people 
are still waiting right now, they're still in the waiting game. It's a 
long leadership contest. So, you know, obviously it's easy to rule 
things out, but takes a little longer to have those conversations with 
your friends, family, and people that might be organizing for you before
 you make your clear decision to move on. Obviously the NDP is in a bit 
of a turmoil right now, still questions swirling around Tom as interim 
leader. I think obviously members of parliament and Tom himself and the 
membership really has to ask themselves now what's best for the party. 
What is going to help us move past this period and keep rebuilding, 
particularly as we go into the fall? For Tom, obviously his strength is 
in the House of Commons. But what you really need to see from a leader 
is not just that work in parliament, but in rebuilding the party, 
rebuilding the party and fundraising, and in organization and ensuring 
that we have the tools we need to still be a strong opposition party, 
but also grow as a political party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STEPHENSON: Okay. So 
Gerry, let's ask you, you're also a Conservative party which is having a
 bit of a leadership contest of itself, and perhaps some of its own 
internal meltdowns at this point. Is a long space in front of the 
leadership like this problematic? You have two parties doing it. And it 
means the Liberals can just go to town with a very strong leader while 
these other parties fight it out internally and basically fall off the 
radar screen. GERRY NICHOLLS (Political Commentator): Well I think in 
this case, for these parties, a long leadership race is probably a good 
idea, because I have the sense that both New Democrats and Conservatives
 are kind of like accident victims right now. They're still kind of in a
 state of shock. They're still kind of traumatized. And also they're 
also asking themselves some pretty profound questions. What do we want 
to be when we grow up? I mean how are we going to redefine our 
ideologies so that they're relevant in the 21st century? So those are 
some really deep questions, and I think it's going to take a long time 
to come up with those answers. I think the NDP has an added challenge in
 that unlike the Conservatives they have an ideological rival on the 
left, i.e., the Liberal Party of Canada, which under Justin Trudeau has 
become kind of the progressive party, and in a sense has sucked all the 
air out of the NDP balloon. So, yeah, both parties have challenges 
moving forward. Both parties are having a tough time in their leadership
 races. But we'll see what the world is like in two years. We don't 
know. That's the thing about politics. Things can change really quickly,
 and two years from now, things might look better for both the New 
Democrats and the Conservatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STEPHENSON: Greg, one of 
the big questions that's come up here is the role of Tom Mulcair , and 
whether him staying on helps the party because it's the steady hand and 
guided leadership even though he seems to be nowhere. He pops up maybe 
once every couple of months. Doesn't seem too happy to be there. Others 
are saying, no, he's got to step down so that someone else can take over
 as interim leader and we can start to refresh. What do you think the 
best thing is for the party when it comes to Tom Mulcair ?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GREG MACEAHERN (<span class="companylink">Environics Communications</span>
 ): What surprised me about the, how badly he lost the leadership review
 was that no one expected it. And that is an important detail. That 
means that he, perhaps he and the people around him, who are usually the
 best and the brightest in every party, I know my friend Sally is out 
west now, so that's my, you know, perhaps they should bring Sally back, 
but I think part of the challenge is how they did not see this coming. 
That speaks to me as somebody who's not connected to his caucus, to his 
party, and there's something really wrong there. To me, at that point, 
that's when you have to step down. The NDP don't have a Bob Rae at this 
point. Bob Rae kept the Liberals alive in order to get to that next 
leadership point. Bob Rae was magnificent in the House of Commons during
 question period. You could hear a pin drop. And I think they need to 
turn to somebody who is not the former leader, not the future leader, 
but somebody who can kind of keep the lights on while, as what Sally 
talked about, increased membership through fundraising goes on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STEPHENSON: Okay, let's 
switch gears here a little bit and get into some social media 
controversy, because that's always fun. There's a new <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>
 ad. Check it out. Take a look at this for our viewers at home. It's 
from Brad Trost. He is a Conservative MP. And you can see there it says 
Brad Trost is 100 percent Conservative and will fight for you. Like this
 if you think we should keep men out of women's washrooms, and there's a
 picture of a little girl. This is, I assume, a reference to some of the
 debates about transgendered people in Canada being able to choose which
 bathroom they go into, or non-gendered bathrooms. Gerry, is this a 
smart approach for the Conservatives, or for this particular MP?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NICHOLLS: Well I think we
 have to put this in context. What I find interesting about the 
Conservative leadership race is that, and I kind of thought that would 
happen, is that the party is kind of breaking down into its ideological 
component parts, so it's kind of like a gang war of the various 
ideologies. You have the libertarians under Maxime Bernier, you have the
 red Tories with Michael Chong at their head, and Kellie Leitch seems to
 have staked out the populist position. Trost is sort of saying I'm the 
social Conservative champion. In fact, he's really bold about it. He 
makes no bones about it. He is the so-con in this race. He is their flag
 bearer. So I think with this ad, this is, he thinks this is a really 
hot-button issue ad for him, and something that will appeal to the 
hardcore of the hardcore so-cons. Is it amateurish? Yes. Is it 
simplistic? Yes. Is it going to invite a lot of mockery? Yes. But as 
they say in the military, if something stupid but works, then it isn't 
stupid, and we'll see if this works for him or not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STEPHENSON: Sally, do you
 think that that is part of, we were talking about this sort of culture 
war internally in the Conservatives where you have Kellie Leitch and 
maybe Brad Trost on the so-con side of things, you have Rona Ambrose 
very clearly moving away from that even though she's the interim leader.
 Is this all part of the Tories trying to figure out where their base is
 at and where they need to move as a party?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSSER: I think so. And,
 you know, I have to say that I would actually take kind of a slow burn 
NDP leadership race over what we're seeing out of the Conservatives 
right now. Obviously people are trying to stake out their ground, wedge 
people on certain issues, and I think that's natural in a leadership 
race. But what I heard, and I was in Calgary yesterday and in Edmonton 
last week, Conservatives I talked to are extremely frustrated that as 
this race heats up and is generating a fair bit of the media attention, 
but it's all the wrong things, it's all the things that I think many 
people in the Conservative party want to move away from, they're not 
talking about economic issues. They're not talking about issues that 
just really affect the day-to-day families. These are, you know, it's 
not dog whistle politics, it's fog horn I heard somebody say the other 
day, and I would have to agree with that. But, you know, I mean just the
 Brad Trost ad, it's just laughable, the idea that this is going to be 
his winner, you know, fighting against transgendered people being able 
to take a leak wherever they feel like is just nuts to me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Can we 
say that on TV? HOUSSER: I say bring it on. Keep it coming, right. 
STEPHENSON: Let's be fair here, Greg. Every party, especially when they 
are in opposition, there's a lot more freedom for people to say what 
they want. There are some Canadians who will see that ad and they'll 
say, yeah, I like that. You know, is there a place, or is this kind of a
 rogue MP thing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACEACHERN: But there is a freedom in every party for stupidity, you know, but there's a cost for that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSSER: There is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACEACHERN: Cheryl 
Gallant comes to mind. Brad Trost. Brad said in the summer that, I 
believe, something like God put Conservatives on the planet to lower 
taxes. You know, washroom issues, one of the great issues of our times. 
And, you know, this is something that's going to solve it. I just think 
this shows that there is no Conservative party. There's a Harper party, 
it's made up of progressives and reform, they got together, they were 
able to govern for about ten years, they still don't know who they are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STEPHENSON: Okay, I've 
got to break in here because right now we're going to Montreal where the
 city's mayor Denis Coderre is holding a press conference on the 
resignation of all three board panelists tasked with reviewing the <b>Energy</b> East pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
DENIS CODERRE (Montreal Mayor Through Translator): Mr. Watson made the 
decision of integrity. He was diligent and he did everything he could in
 order to protect the integrity of the <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span>
 . It is with great satisfaction that the metropolitan community of 
Montreal, and the union of municipalities of Quebec, receives this 
decision from the chair and the vice-chair of the NEB. And as we can see
 it, it's not only the panel as such are, or it's the president, Mr. 
Watson himself. And in order to demonstrate that he wants to be entirely
 impartial, and to manage the perceptions, and he's removing himself 
from this file. So we have to recognize that and to congratulate him. 
And moreover, it's not only the panel or the president, but it is the 
entire staff that has dealt with this file. This being said, I also 
want, like the decision demonstrates, that way it can be ensured that 
the next commissioners will be bilingual and will be competent. We have 
to make sure that those people can speak in both official languages. But
 with all due respect, I would like to make some suggestions. Given the 
fact that there's reality of <b>social acceptance</b>, and as well a 
reality with the indigenous people, that we have to be sensitive with 
managing how the territory will be developed, but we have to make sure 
that all partners can contribute, as it should be, in this discussion, 
in this debate. It should be also appropriate that the commissioners 
might be more sensitive, and we need people who acknowledge and 
recognize that we need also some oil through pipelines, but we have to 
see and be sensitive in order to have a debate that will cover all the 
angles. Therefore, we will be waiting for obviously the nomination of 
those new commissioners and the metropolitan community of Montreal and 
the Association of Municipalities of Quebec, and as a chair of the 
Montreal community we will take part with to the hearings, with the 
belief that a project that is presented to us is not a good project, it 
is bad, and it came because of the businesses of <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> . And <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>
 itself has some homework to do. I will never apologize as the mayor of 
Montreal, as the chair of the Metropolitan Community of Montreal to 
protect our environment and also to guarantee healthy economic 
development, and also make sure that my citizens and my co-citizens are 
safe and we are responsible. Environment is also for me a jurisdiction 
that I share. So obviously when through the years the metropolitan 
community of Montreal gave itself some tools for planning and 
development, it is appropriate that we talked about a new pipeline that 
we can take into consideration the consensus that we shape together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CODERRE: I've been saying since day one that I have, that I trust <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span>
 , and I clearly trust also its president, Mr. Peter Watson . I would 
like to first of all notice that Mr. Watson showed that he's a man of 
integrity, that he'd been working in due diligence, that he's been doing
 his homework, and that the decision that he's been putting up together 
was for the sake of the integrity of the institution. And I think that 
we have to salute that. We have to thank him for his sensitivity. And he
 understands the importance of that issue, but it's also the importance 
of the process itself. So I want to salute him. I want to say that he 
just confirmed the trust that I have in its institution and in the 
president itself. And now it's, the fact that now we're talking about 
recusal of the commissioners, also of Mr. Watson himself for that file, 
but all the people who work around that file, just sent a strong message
 that they've been doing their homework, and it's a good decision. The 
Montreal metropolitan community, me as a president, the Quebec 
Municipalities Union will participate in the future audience. But I 
think that respectfully we should suggest maybe that not only, and we 
think that...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STEPHENSON: Okay. So that
 is obviously the Mayor of Montreal, Denis Coderre. He's been a vocal 
opponent of this pipeline. It's been a difficult issue for the Trudeau 
government. It's just gotten a lot more difficult with the entire 
hearing panel walking away and resigning. How does the federal 
government handle this now? They haven't really wanted to take 
ownership, but it kind of seems like there might need to be a hand on 
the rudder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACEACHERN: Yeah, and I'm
 not sure I entirely agree with you. Quickly, I would say from a public 
policy perspective, it's essential that you have public confidence in 
the process. So I think the step in that case, it's good. Speaking 
politically, we just heard from the mayor of Montreal. One of the 
biggest thorns, political thorns in the side on this issue is now happy.
 So from a political perspective, that's done. The two gentlemen were 
appointed by the previous Conservative government, there is an 
opportunity here for the Liberal government to now appoint a couple of 
people and have more input on the process. I would see it, yes, as a 
challenge, but there's also an opportunity there for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STEPHENSON: Okay, Sally, 
the Liberal government replaces this entire hearing board with Liberal 
appointees instead of Conservative. Is that likely to convince any of 
the opponents of this pipeline who aren't Denis Coderre and a former 
Liberal? I'm thinking of First Nations, I'm thinking of environmental 
opponents, that the process has changed fundamentally at all?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSSER: Yeah, I think 
just the replacing of the people on the board, it has to be more than 
that. During the election, the Liberals made promises about reforming 
and renewing the <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span>
 , and what we see right now is, with these hearings, and the gong show 
that it was, I think it's going to be difficult for people that, I heard
 Mr. Coderre say that he had confidence, but I don't know that a lot of 
Canadians do. I think in order for people to accept whatever the 
findings are of <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span>
 review, they have to have a certain trust in the system. I don't see 
that that's there necessarily. I certainly hope that the Liberals really
 consider that moving forward is that rebuilding that trust is a huge 
part of it. What I do know is certainly out west here is tremendously 
frustrating that we seem to be as a country in just gridlock, not just 
for this but numerous projects. And, you know, I feel like for years 
there hasn't been anything on a national scope, certainly from the <b>energy</b>
 sector, approved. So something has got to give. We need to be able to 
get our products to market. We need to be able to create jobs here in 
Canada. And this process continues to be tremendously frustrating, 
particularly for provinces like Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STEPHENSON: Mmm. And, 
Gerry, you know, I hear a lot from people in Alberta, that's where I 
grew up, who are worried. They're saying the pipelines aren't being 
approved, nothing is happening, it's stuck, this process now just seems 
to be even more stuck than before. What does the government need to do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NICHOLLS: Well I think 
people in Alberta should be worried by what's happening here. This is 
one of those issues which divides Harper from Justin Trudeau . Harper 
loved pipelines, right. He would put a pipeline through his 
grandmother's basement if he had to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSSER: He never got any built, though.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NICHOLLS: Trudeau hates 
them. Trudeau hates pipelines, but I don't think he has the political 
courage to actually nix it. So what I think he's doing is he's sorts of 
taking the Barack Obama approach, which he did with Keystone, which is 
to keep dragging it out and dragging it out and dragging it out until it
 dies. I would be surprised if this pipeline ever gets through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STEPHENSON: Okay. Well 
we'll certainly be keeping an eye on it. Thank you very much to our 
Friday strategists for joining us. We'll see you next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NICHOLLS: Thank you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACEACHERN: Take care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSSER: Thank you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STEPHENSON: When we return, our Friday press gallery is here with their political plays and misplays of the week. Stay with us.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <b>Energy</b> East 
project has pitted some eastern politicians, aboriginal leaders and 
environmentalists against industry and government leaders in the West, 
who are eager to gain broader market access and international prices for
 crude exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the federal

Justin Trudeau has stressed the importance of resource projects winning <b>social acceptance</b> from the local citizens and First Nations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Montreal Mayor Denis 
Coderre, along with the mayor of Laval and other municipal 
representatives, walked out of the hearings Monday not long after the 
demonstrators charged in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Coderre was the first
 person scheduled to give testimony Monday but chose instead to leave, 
calling the protests a “masquerade."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and other local mayors oppose the project. <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>
 has not been able to confirm what approach would be used for the 
pipeline to cross the Ottawa River, raising concerns about a potential 
spill upstream from the drinking water intake for Greater Montreal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are too many 
problems we are witnessing to accept the project," Mr. Coderre told 
reporters after he decided to leave Monday's hearings. “We're saying the
 project [<span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>] presented is 
wrong, it's bad and we don't have the answers. And frankly, one of the 
main issues is contingency plans, everything regarding safety."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> spokesman Tim Duboyce said 
the company was eager to resume the review process. “We have had and 
continue to have a positive dialogue with Quebeckers on <b>Energy</b> East," he said in an e-mailed statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Listening, earning trust and dealing with the public's concerns will help us build and operate a safe pipeline."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Duboyce noted that 
Quebec business and labour leaders have endorsed the project, which the 
company says will generate 3,100 direct and indirect jobs in the 
province during its construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Members of Quebec 
construction unions demonstrated in support of the pipeline outside the 
building where the hearing was to be held.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former New Brunswick 
Premier Frank McKenna said Monday's protest and previous opposition from
 Mr. Coderre suggest the project's critics are uninterested in evidence 
about safety measures that would be presented at the hearings. “Before 
the evidence is even submitted, they say they will not support it under 
any circumstances," said Mr. McKenna, now a deputy chairman at 
Toronto-Dominion Bank and a long-time <b>Energy</b> East ally. “This isn't about pipeline safety but about opposition to a carbon-based economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">… The government shouldn't simply listen to the loudest voices."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chiefs and elders from 
three Mohawk communities were also due to appear Monday but said 
afterward they were unsure whether they will participate in rescheduled 
hearings. The Mohawks complained the <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span>
 process is inadequate in dealing with their aboriginal rights, and 
accused the panel of being biased in favour of approving the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal agency is 
“trying to convince people that this is the right thing to do," Grand 
Chief Joe Norton, of the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake, told a news 
conference. “Our primary goal is to ensure the safety of our land and 
our people."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Mr. Coderre asked for the hearings to be suspended after media reports revealed that two of the three <span class="companylink">NEB</span> commissioners overseeing the review process met with former Quebec premier Jean Charest, who was paid as a consultant for <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commissioners met 
privately with a number of Quebec stakeholders – including business 
groups and environmentalists – last year as they prepared for the 
review. Numerous environmental groups have urged the federal government 
to suspend the hearings to deal with what they say is the perception of 
bias.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Duboyce acknowledged that Mr. Charest was being paid as a consultant to <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> at the time of the meeting, but insisted he “was not asked to lobby or advocate on the project's behalf."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Association des 
constructeurs de routes et grands travaux du Québec (ACRGTQ), the 
Association industrielle de l’Est de Montréal (AIEM), the Association 
des firmes de génie-conseil – Québec (AFG), the Association des 
propriétaires de machinerie lourde du Québec (APMLQ), the <span class="companylink">Board of Trade of Metropolitan Montreal</span>
 (BTMM), the Conseil provincial du Québec des métiers de la 
construction(International), the Québec Employers' Council (QEC), the 
Fédération des chambres de commerce du Québec (FCCQ) and 
FTQ-Construction, believe that <b>Energy</b> East is “very important for Québec's economic growth and its <b>energy</b> future.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 coalition believes the project deserves a “pragmatic and realistic 
analysis.” Moreover, the coalition calls on citizens to take the time to
 find out more about the <b>Energy</b> East project, while taking into consideration all of its features, including its economic benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stimulating the economy</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a context where 
stimulating the economy has become a necessity, where working hours have
 fallen by more than 40 per cent in the industrial building sector and 
by nearly 30 per cent in the civil engineering sector, the coalition 
believes that Québec cannot overlook one of the larger construction 
projects to come along in some 25 years. The coalition noted that very 
few national projects could generate and maintain, on an annual basis, 
over some nine years, more than 14,000 direct and indirect jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly one-quarter of those jobs would be in Québec during project development and construction. According to the coalition, <b>Energy</b> East is indeed a job creator and arguments to the contrary don't hold water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The coalition noted that 
this private investment project will generate more than $10 billion in 
tax revenues, above and beyond all other economic benefits and it will 
contribute more than $50 billion to Canada's GDP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leveraging expertise</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic activity generated by an infrastructure project like <b>Energy</b>
 East will lead to the creation of new businesses and to the development
 of subcontractor networks that will remain active well after the 
pipeline is completed, as they export their know-how, the group said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The coalition believes 
that this project represents yet another opportunity to leverage the 
expertise of workers and businesses in Québec's construction industry. 
An expertise acquired over decades of work on large infrastructure 
projects throughout North America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the installation of 
vast wind farms, to the design and commissioning of some of the larger 
hydroelectric installations on the planet, Québec know-how stands second
 to none. Younger workers will benefit from training, apprenticeships 
and mentoring. The importance, the scope and the leading edge 
requirements of <b>Energy</b> East, will make it a catalyst for the growth of our workforce and for the enhancement of its world class expertise.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diversifying <b>energy</b> supply</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it supports the <b>energy</b>
 transition that the Québec government has committed to, the coalition 
“reminds citizens that the consumption of petroleum will not come to an 
end any time soon. Legislators acknowledge that by 2030, hydrocarbons 
will still account for some 40 per cent of our <b>energy</b> needs. We 
will therefore continue to rely on petroleum and its derivatives for 
transportation and other products we use daily, such as plastics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Québec imports 100 per cent of the petroleum it uses. The coalition believes that <b>Energy</b>
 East is an opportunity to build a national market for locally produced 
oil, thereby increasing our refineries' competitiveness, while ensuring 
the stability and diversity of our <b>energy</b> supply,” the group 
added. “Rarely do we see a project that can serve as a foundation for a 
society's economic development, as well as its <b>energy</b> future. Once it is completed, in accordance with principles of sustainable development and of <b>social acceptance</b>, <b>Energy</b> East will enable Québec to take on a myriad of challenges. The coalition supports <b>Energy</b> East.”</p>

 Chalk River nuclear research centre is set to lose the aged reactor 
that has been the centrepiece of Canada's nuclear technology effort for 
decades, but its private sector managers aim to keep the laboratories 
humming by being part of industry's much-touted “next big thing": the 
commercialization of small modular reactors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their vision: populating the North with microreactors they say could provide greenhouse gas-emission-free <b>energy</b>
 at a reasonable cost to remote communities, mine sites and oil sands 
projects. Achieving that ambitious goal would boost Canada's nuclear 
laboratories and the domestic nuclear industry that has seen a number of
 once-promising technologies fall by the wayside.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless
 there is another extension to its licence, Chalk River's 59-year-old 
National Research Universal (NRU) reactor will shut down in early 2018, 
ending a celebrated but stormy history as a workhorse that contributed 
to the development of the Candu heavy-water reactor and supplied 
cancer-fighting medical isotopes to the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The private-sector 
managers and the government owners insist the NRU shutdown will not 
spell the end of Canada's role in advancing technology for nuclear 
technology, or the shuttering of the Chalk River facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given its long history and variety of scientific expertise, the <span class="companylink">Atomic <b>Energy</b> of Canada Ltd</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">facilities are uniquely 
positioned to work with companies looking to commercialize their design 
for small modular reactors (SMR) as well as to attract other new 
business, said Mark Lesinski, chief executive officer of Canadian 
Nuclear Laboratories (CNL), the consortium that operates the Ontario 
site on behalf of government-owned AECL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The role of the 
laboratory is pivotal to any [SMR] technology that would be deployed in 
Canada," Mr. Lesinski said in an interview at his Chalk River office. “I
 think we can bring to bear a prototype quicker and more cost 
effectively because of our experience and our capabilities here."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics, however, argue 
that the industry's higher costs and safety concerns will leave it 
uncompetitive with renewable electricity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Left to deteriorate under
 the Conservatives, Chalk River has received a boost under the Liberals,
 who in April provided $800million over five years to upgrade its 
infrastructure, while still providing its annual $960-million in 
operating funding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Chalk River is not just 
an important part of what government does in terms of research but is 
also something used by industry," Kim Rudd, parliamentary secretary to 
Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr, said in an interview. Ms. Rudd said
 nuclear technology remains a key development priority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Situated on the forested 
banks of the Ottawa River 180 kilometres northwest of the capital, the 
Chalk River research centre dates back to the 1950s, when Canada's 
postwar nuclear program was born with the creation of <span class="companylink">Atomic <b>Energy</b> of Canada Ltd</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It hosts 70 laboratories and employs some 500 scientists and technicians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AECL was an albatross for the former Conservative government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chalk River's NRU had an 
unplanned shutdown in 2007 that provoked a critical shortage of medical 
isotopes and a nasty showdown between then-prime minister Stephen Harper
 and the top nuclear regulator at the time, Linda Keen. It was forced to
 shut down again in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conservatives broke 
up the former AECL, selling its commercial reactor operations to 
SNCLavalin Group Inc. for $15-million five years ago and contracting out
 the management of the government-owned labs to a consortium of 
engineering companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CNL is hungry for new business opportunities, and the SMRs represent only part of the solution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of its role is decommissioning the NRU and closing down the Whiteshell laboratory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will end the 
production of the cancer-fighting isotope molybdenum 99 in October, 
forcing the medical community to import them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lesinski and his team
 are looking to improve efficiency and expand beyond the traditional 
role of supporting Candu to provide services for global nuclear reactor 
vendors and operators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some labs still support 
work with the Candu heavy-water reactor. That includes the $26-billion 
plan to refurbish aging units at Ontario's Darlington and Bruce plants, 
and <span class="companylink">SNC-Lavalin</span>'s partnership with 
Chinese operators for fuel technology that allows Candus to run on waste
 generated by China's light-water reactors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others are focused on 
related technologies. Physicist Sam Suppiah runs the hydrogen isotope 
laboratory, which has developed and sells a high-temperature steam 
electrolysis unit to produce the valuable gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the ultimate prize
 is the SMR market, which has as many as 90 proponents around the world 
rushing to commercialize their designs. CNL executives are in 
discussions with several developers. The companies are looking for 
prelicensing approval from the Canadian regulator, which basically 
amounts to support for the technology, research backing from CNL, a site
 for demonstration projects and – for most – subsidies from Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics such as <span class="companylink">Greenpeace</span>
 campaigner Shawn-Patrick Stensil suggest SMR is just the latest version
 of the nuclear industry's piein-the-sky promises. “The industry will 
eventually relive past rejection due to lack of <b>social acceptance</b>, unproven designs, bad economics and competition from more proven clean-tech competitors," he said.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sault Ste. Marie has become home to a medical marijuana clinic, but if you didn't know it, you would never suspect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The clinic, on March Street, looks like any tastefully designed medicaloffice and it has nomarijuana on site.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That because their isn't any there," explains Bodystream business designer Brian Warner. "We are not a dispensary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Rather we are helping people who are interested in trying medicalmarijuana as an alternative therapy to navigate the system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are a medical 
clinic." You enter into a tastefully decorated waiting room. You are 
greeted by a friendly receptionist dressed in scrubs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The clinic also houses an
 education room and a testing room, as all patients are drug tested 
throughout the procedure to ensure they are not using drugs that have 
not been prescribed to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Souzanne Scott was willing to share her experiences. "I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis 32 years ago," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I am at a capping stage 
in my disease where there are very few drugs that we haven't used and I 
am not interested in using opiates."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I didn't' really want to be using marijuana, but it's my only real option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I was on Interferon for 15 years, and that was at the point where it was still being tested."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marijuana provides her with effective pain relief, she said. "The only side effect is the smile onmy face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's actually also helped me put on a little weight, something that I have been struggling with for a long time," said Scott.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She had tried in past to 
get a prescription for marijuana because she knew it would work but she 
could find no provider educated in prescribing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warner's clinic made the connections for her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This has been great. I don't even have to smoke it," Scott said. "I'm vaping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I used to feel really guilty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not a drinker. Heck, I go to church. Being able to legally obtain nothing that has helped me so much has lifted the guilt."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clinic director Drew 
Craig pointed out, "Our clientele isn't criminal. They are just everyday
 people, just trying to manage pain and not use barbiturates."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Craig invites those with concerns to contact him so that they can get an understanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We aren't here to preach
 that medical marijuana is better than other therapies or treatments 
that your doctor might prescribe," said Warner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have seen the 
increase in knowledge about it as a therapy, and the demand. Patients 
are asking their doctors and they aren't getting the response that they 
need," said Warner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"From a prescribing 
aspect, you can't overdose on marijuana and it has no addictive 
qualities," he said. "Patients deserve to have a better choice."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patients are encouraged to come in with a referral, though due to the physician short a gein Northern</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario the clinic also accepts walk-in clients and will assist them in gathering their information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't want to go against doctors' wishes. We want to help them with the process," Warner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The majority of our clients at the clinic so far have been over 50 years old," said Craig.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Walk into one of our 
waiting rooms and you are going to see people from different walks of 
life, people ranging from those in their mid-20s to grandparents," said 
Warner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The clinic is strictly aligned with licensed providers," and it sets up clients with a dispensary, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Filled prescriptions are then mailed to the patients," said Craig.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Referring to stereotypes -
 people smoking marijuana or eating munchies and passing out on the 
couch- he said marijuana comes in different strains that have different 
effects on a patient.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While an Indica might be the choice for a nighttime medication, a Stevia might help provide some <b>energy</b>, said Craig.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Users also don't have to smoke or even vape their medication. It can be processed as edibles or topical creams."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bodysteam has 11 clinics 
across the province and hopes to have 22 in operation by the end of the 
year. Warner said, "One of the greatest challenges that we face is the 
stigma that surrounds marijuana, though in the last year we have seen <b>social acceptance</b> grow significantly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are trying to put another face on it. We aren't sporting big cannabis leaves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are separate from the pot culture," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Norman J. Kalyniuk M.D. is on staffand we are looking to bring more doctors on board to meet the demand," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bodystream encourages 
those who aren't aware to research the topic and find out about medical 
marijuana and what the clinics can do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is not set list of what marijuana can and can't treat," he continued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are trying to support not only the local community but also the medical community."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has found that many 
doctors are willing to prescribe but don't know how to navigate the 
system. "Now they have the option of referring people to us," he said. 
"The key thing to remember is that we are a medical clinic and no 
products are on site."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott encourages other sufferers to check out the clinic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For me it was a straight path to getting some relief. I am very open about that. It's really been life changing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I attribute it to my still being able to walk," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a wonderful breath of fresh air with all of the struggles I have had, to be able to navigate this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm not the kind of 
person who can go out and buy it off the street," Scott said. "This has 
helped me ensure a stable supply of good quality products."</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As
 reported in the Winnipeg Free Press, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said
 a new continental target for clean electricity generation could open 
the door for greater Canadian hydroelectricity exports to the United 
States (North American clean <b>energy</b> pledge prompts talk of more Canadian hydro exports, June 30). Is this an economic reality for Manitoba?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At present, Wuskwatim, 
our new operating hydroelectric generating station, produces electricity
 at about 10 cents per kilowatt-hour. The average sale price of 
electricity for export, and mostly to the U.S., is about four cents per 
kilowatt-hour, and <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span> ratepayers are making up the loss with our increasing hydro rates — subsidizing the Americans with our costly clean <b>energy</b>.
 So if we are to follow Prime Minister Trudeau's target for increased 
hydro exports to the U.S., are we going to do this through continued 
subsidization of our clean <b>energy</b> to the Americans?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We
 are continuing the boondoggle by building Bipole III with its 
ridiculous west-side route and Keeyask hydroelectric generating station,
 both now under construction, and their electricity production price is 
certainly not going to be less than 10 cents per kilowatt-hour. The need
 for Keeyask for Manitoba's use disappears through application of <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span>'s aggressive <b>energy</b>-saving plan, released the day after the recent provincial election. If adopted, Keeyask's far-from-profitably-generated clean <b>energy</b>
 will all be available for export to the U.S. at a continuing financial 
loss with ongoing and increased subsidy by Manitobans. This is a problem
 <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span>'s new board is charged to resolve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We cannot wishfully expect the price of U.S. electricity will magically increase to finally bring us a profit for our hydro <b>energy</b> exports. This past week, the $2.77-million Pan Canadian Wind Integration Study was released. It was co-funded by <span class="companylink">Natural Resources Canada</span> and the <span class="companylink">Canadian Wind <b>Energy</b> Association</span>. Its advisory committee consisted of representatives from most provinces and from the U.S., including from its Department of <b>Energy</b>. David Jacobson from <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span> represented Manitoba.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is significant for Manitobans in this report is that by 2025, wind <b>energy</b>
 will be available at a cost of less than 4.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. 
Recovery of capital investment will be in four years. The existing hydro
 resources across Canada and additional wide-area electric transmission 
will “firm up" the uncertainty of the wind resources. Therefore, 
anticipating electricity prices to increase so Manitoba's new 
hydroelectricity will become profitable just on exports to the U.S. is a
 dream. The future price of wind and possibly solar <b>energy</b> will hold it down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study is only the beginning of how the clean <b>energy</b> future can be profitably developed. The next step is a thorough study of the benefits of a <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>, and transcontinental, electric transmission superhighway system. A <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>
 electric system is particularly strategic with Canada's commitment to 
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and in the reduced plundering of 
our non-renewable <b>energy</b> resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By following the 
Americans' rule to only build electric transmission interconnections 
whose economic benefits exceed costs by 25 per cent, any public or 
private investment in the <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> electric superhighway will be profitable. This can be done, and <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span>
 did it in 1980 with a transmission line from Winnipeg to Minneapolis, 
whose benefits exceeded costs by 2 1/2 times. This transmission 
interconnection helped keep our hydro rates low for 20 years, and it 
paid for itself in just a few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Benefits to be evaluated 
include an overall reduction in electric generation and fossil-fuelled 
generators, increased dependable use of wind and solar <b>energy</b>, added security to electric utilities and advantage of time-zone differences to share <b>energy</b> east and west. <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span>
 will have new markets for its hydroelectricity from which it can select
 the best price available east, west and south instead of being captive 
to the U.S. market as it is today. If <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span> seeks to sell its excess generation capacity from Keeyask through the electric superhighway in place of just <b>energy</b>, less financial loss from its present development plan may be possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Natural Resources Canada</span>, having seen 
the encouraging results of the study, is interested in moving forward. 
The problem will be the provinces seeing eye to eye for an east-to-west 
electric superhighway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other major problem will be gaining <b>social acceptance</b>
 for overhead, high-power electric transmission lines. Following the 
lead shown in Denmark, the U.K. and now the U.S., aesthetic, low-profile
 transmission pylons are the way forward. In special areas, underground 
cables can be applied, but are too expensive for long distances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As we decarbonize to keep valuable fossil fuels in the ground, there is a new and exciting way forward for us to pursue. With a <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>
 and transcontinental electric superhighway system, our hydro rates may 
even stay manageable and Prime Minister Trudeau's target may be possible
 after all.</p>

 previous centuries political theorists - from liberals to 
revolutionaries - argued progress was as inevitable as the rising and 
setting sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last century, a growing 
global economy, improvements in Canadian health care and education and 
the American civil rights movement were all evidence that social 
progress was a fact of history. But in this century, as social progress 
has been frustrated, a different progressivism has emerged. And, true to
 our diminished expectations of collective action, it's now a force that
 comes from the individual.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, widely held progressive values in Canada are driving a political push to root out discrimination and create greater <b>social acceptance</b>.
 The rapid change in Canadians' attitudes about sexual and gender 
identity is testimony to its potential. So is a reinvigorated 
anti-racist attitude - evident in everything from advertising to Black 
Lives Matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Women are once again 
likely to describe themselves as feminists. Canadians' progressive 
values have generally resisted the xenophobic response to refugees 
which, at least in part, fuel Donald Trump and Brexit. But as we sit all
 smug with our Canada global cool contrasting with those burning fires, 
are progressives being played for fools? Has the language of 
progressivism become an empty suit any politician can slip on to mollify
 and misdirect from their undermining of social progress?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. President Barack 
Obama's recent speech in Ottawa is strong evidence progressivism has 
become a cheap political suit. Strip the progressive rhetoric offObama's
 speech. What was underneath was a naked ask for Canada to support the 
United States' military and adopt the Trans Pacific Partnership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one can doubt Obama's -
 or Trudeau's - words of liberal progressivism. But how do those 
progressive words square with Obama's continued campaign of drone-driven
 targeted killings in countries with which the U.S. is not at war?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A campaign many respected legal experts say is contrary to international law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And how do they square 
that with the fact Canada is providing military equipment to the very 
unprogressive, very unfeminist Saudi Kingdom? A place where 
homosexuality is a crime punished by death?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How do they square with TPP? <span class="companylink">Doctors Without Borders</span>
 has warned TPP would hike medicine costs. A former BlackBerry CEO 
argues it would hurt Canadian innovation. Worker groups express concerns
 about manufacturing jobs and public services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What we know for sure is investors have successfully used the <span class="companylink">World Trade Organization</span> to put limits on green <b>energy</b> initiatives in Canada. And under <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>,
 Canada has been the biggest target of investor actions - many against 
our environmental protection laws, according to a recent CCPA study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And with Trudeau musing 
about more privatization, the risk to social progress is mounting. Like 
Premier Kathleen Wynne, who is selling Ontario's electricity grid to 
investors, the federal government is preparing to sell infrastructure - 
such as airports, transit, ports or high-occupancy vehicle lanes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From a cost perspective, 
embedding a layer of rent-seekers makes little sense. Government can 
always borrow money at better rates than private investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the deeper risk is, 
behind the rhetoric of progressivism, governments will let investors tie
 the hands of future governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In so doing they'll prevent Canadians from making social progress - on climate, transit, Pharmacare or social programs.</p>

 East pipeline project to Quebec authorities. However, as a result of 
negotiations with the province, important aspects have been excluded 
from the assessment process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having ditched the bulldozer approach, the public relations staffat <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> now seem to be out to gain <b>social acceptance</b> for the project.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It my profound conviction, as an informed citizen, an environmentalist and an economist, that <b>Energy</b> East should be opposed without compromise. It is a trap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pipeline's purpose is
 to bring diluted bitumen to tidewater, in order to sell oil on 
international markets. Any local consumption in Eastern Canada is 
incidental.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A pipeline of any sort 
implies environmental and health risks, which can be partly mitigated 
with appropriate investments and technology. <b>Energy</b> East will 
cross more than 860 bodies of water, including the St. Lawrence River, 
where the drinking water of more than 5 million people is at risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real goal here is to 
expand oilsands extraction, not to meet the needs of current production 
capacity. This will have devastating effects on greenhouse-gas 
production. Before it is even burned, every gallon of this oil will have
 sent into the sky up to four times as much CO2 as the conventional oil 
we still produce in Alberta and Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Energy</b> East's 
useful life would be at least 40 years. This suggests Canada would be 
expanding oilsands production until 2060, when the rest in the world, in
 theory, will have moved away from dependency on hydrocarbon combustion.
 Canada will be trapped for the next five decades, addicted to extreme 
oil extraction with all the deleterious economic and environmental 
effects that would follow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is this a really problem? Could we not expand the sands and use the revenue to finance a green transition? And could not <b>Energy</b> East be part of the transition solution?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These questions bring us to heart of the <b>Energy</b> East trap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Climate science tells us 
that 85 per cent of oilsands reserves must stay in the ground until at 
least 2050 if we want to avoid a collapse of the Earth's climate. <b>Energy</b>
 East would free for burning an equivalent of 32 million tonnes of CO2 a
 year. At this rate, the sky would fill up with greenhouse gases before 
we run out of oil to pump out of the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One can expect <b>energy</b>
 companies to do all they can to realize the value locked in the ground.
 But we know that we have to move away from our carbonbased economy, and
 that we have to do it fast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem with <b>Energy</b>
 East is that it is instrumental to a rapid expansion of the oilsands 
complex, and that this will further deepen the grip of extraction 
industries on the west. It will multiply the economic distortions in 
Canada as a whole - on our private sector investment where the oil 
sector is crowding out other industries, on our currency and on our 
labour markets. Oilsands expansion will also mean committing all our

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What about the forest industry? CouldCanada's forest sector be struggling as well?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Susan Murray, a Spokesperson with the <span class="companylink">Forest Products Association of Canada</span>, the answer is no.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It [the forest industry]
 may not be at the peak situation it was at one time, when it was the 
largest industry in Canada; however, right now, the industry has been 
growing, exports are increasing and the sector is hiring again," she 
said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Forest Products Association of Canada</span> set the goal of hiring 60,000 people between 2010 and 2020. In the first four years of that period, 16,000 people were hired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Some of these [workers] 
are replacing retiring baby boomers, some are new hires,' explained 
Murray.“If anything we are having trouble finding workers.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dana Collins, Executive 
Director for the Canadian Institute of Forestry, agrees that the 
Canadian forest industry is on the uprise again after years of a hard 
downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 2005 and 2009, 
the forest industry’s contribution to Canada’s gross domestic product 
(GDP) declined sharply year-over-year as a result of a consumer shift to
 electronic media and the U.S. housing crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to The Globe 
and Mail, in September 2004, 308,664 Canadians earned a living from 
logging, paper making and wood products manufacturing. A decade later, 
the industry employed just 190,651 people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since its sharp rebound 
in 2010, the forest industry has consistently accounted for 
approximately 1.2 per cent of the total Canadian GDP, with wood product 
manufacturing offsetting declines in pulp and paper manufacturing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the <b>energy</b>,
 mining and many other industries, the forest products industryhas 
beengrowing in size. According to the federal government, in 2014, the 
value of Canada’s forest product exports increased by 9.8 per cent over 
2013, rising to $30.8 billion from $28.4 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, forest 
product exports have done well with the low Canadian dollar, with sales 
to the U.S. returning to historic levels after the collapse of the U.S. 
housing market in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Collins says the forest sector is nowconsidered Canada’s “sunrise industry.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said theforest 
industry overcame its challenges by adapting and innovating, and is no 
longer narrowly defined by pulp and paper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s now a diverse, dynamic, innovative, green, and sustainable sector that supports science, research and development."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry’s 
traditional products - pulp, paper and lumber - are being used to create
 new products such as renewable bio-fuels, green bio-plastics, 
bio-pharmaceuticals, bulletproof vests, car parts and even airplane 
wings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Collins explained that 
the emergence of new products also includes the application 
ofnanotechnology - the engineering of functional systems at the 
molecular scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The application of 
nanotechnology creates a product that's as strong as steel, but 
lighter,' she said. “We can replace steel in cars, for example, using 
forest products.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're also seeing bylaws
 to support this [technology], for example, changes to building codes to
 allow for wood construction in high or midrise buildings,' she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the industry has 
become more innovative, diverse and technically advanced, there is also a
 growing need for new types of skilled workers. The long list of workers
 that the industry now requires includes biologists, millwrights, 
electricians, engineers, sales staff, truck drivers, foresters, 
chemists, economist and risk analysts and IT specialists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the story 
‘Millennials, these career sectors are worth considering’ published in 
The Globe and Mail on Aug. 24, 2015, the forest products industry was 
selected as one of the most promising industries for young Canadian 
professionals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Collins said this 
innovative path of the industry has alsoattracted a more diverse 
workforce, encompassing more women and Aboriginal people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked what we should
 expect of the forest sector in the next five years, Collins said the 
industry will continue to see an emphasis on innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We'll see new product development, innovation in long-lived, durable forest products, and hopefully more of a <b>social acceptance</b>
 and understanding of the environmental benefits of using woodto replace
 heavy carbon-emitting materials such as concrete or steel.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Collinsadded thatforest 
jobs are now popping up all over the country and that this trend is 
expected to continue for the next five years and beyond.</p>

 ideological differences Saskatchewan’s right-of-centre government and 
Alberta’s left-of-centre government might have, their leaders need to 
“bury the hatchet” and present a common argument in regards to their <b>energy</b>
 sectors in the face of federal climate policies that could hit the 
oil-rich Prairie provinces’ economies harder than in the rest of Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Saskatchewan and Alberta
 share interests,” said Trevor McLeod,director of the Centre for Natural
 Resources Policy for the Canada West Foundation. He added: “We need to 
remind Canadians that the world is changing, and that we need to adapt.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McLeod told Thursday’s Economics Society of Calgary luncheon there is precedent for the two provinces to align on <b>energy</b>
 issues, even when their governing parties are on opposite sides of the 
political spectrum. He said premiers Rachel Notley and Brad Wall could 
look to when Saskatchewan was the province with an NDP government under 
then-Premier Allan Blakeney and Alberta’s premier was Progressive 
Conservative leader Peter Lougheed, and the two worked together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Facing similar 
circumstances, they formed a bit of an alliance, and based on the shared
 interests of Alberta and Saskatchewan, they were very effective at 
negotiating together.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to McLeod, there needs to be recognition that <b>energy</b>-producing provinces compete on the world stage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We know that we need to 
do more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but now is the time to make 
sure that the Canadian discussion takes account of the global context,” 
he said. “We need to take that broad view and put competitiveness on the
 radar, and we need to make sure this pan-Canadian climate strategy does
 not hobble [the] Canadian economy at the worst possible time.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mid-last year, McLeod 
co-authored a report, making three recommendations about developing a 
Canadian climate plan. Firstly, the report called for a Canada-wide 
shared offset market as an important first step towards harmonization. 
Secondly, the report said, Western Canada should first determine how to 
integrate its systems when re-evaluating systems and designing new ones,
 and then consider how to link those to the rest of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirdly, in pursuit of 
more effective climate policy, provinces and the nation as a whole 
should be mindful that carbon pricing represents only one policy tool 
among many necessary to achieve substantial emissions reductions. While 
carbon price policies will play a major role in achieving reductions — 
especially based on cost-effectiveness and revenue-generating potential —
 additional “command-and-control” regulations are also vital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking specifically 
about Alberta, McLeod said a major concern for the province and its 
resource-based economy is that despite the government’s 
recently-announced efforts to curb carbon emissions, the federal 
government might demand more in terms of reductions from oil and gas 
producing regions, which could further impact the ability for Alberta’s 
crude to compete with other countries’ production that does not adhere 
to such strict environmental policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If [Prime Minister 
Justin Trudeau] is serious about meeting global commitments made in 
Paris, [then] we should be a bit worried in Alberta and Saskatchewan,” 
he said, adding that while Ottawa indicated it would respect provincial 
jurisdiction on carbon policy, last week the Liberals also announced an 
additional pipeline approval process that would include consideration of
 upstream GHG emissions (DOB, Jan. 27, 2016).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A cynic could be excused
 for believing the federal government plans to use this new ‘pipeline 
national interest test,’ which includes the upstream GHG emissions, as a
 hammer to make sure Alberta, Saskatchewan and some others do more. 
We’ve seen the impact of [Alberta’s] existing climate plan, and it might
 not be the end.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Broad-based carbon price is good: Winter</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jennifer Winter, associate of the <b>energy</b> and environmental policy area at the School of Public Policy at the <span class="companylink">University of Calgary</span>,
 told this week’s luncheon that the provincial government was right to 
implement a broad-based price on carbon, but there are aspects of the 
plan that she would characterize as less than ideal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What you may or may not 
be aware of is that there is also what is called an ‘output subsidy’ for
 large emitters,” she said, adding the climate policy review panel 
indicated the $30-per-tonne rate would result in $3 billion net revenue,
 rather than the near-$6 billion that carbon rate could earn the 
province if it was not for the fact that the plan provides output 
subsidies for large emitters of GHGs that are trade exposed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I would argue that it is
 not the best policy, but it is also not necessarily the worst in the 
way that the Specified Gas Emitters Regulation was constructed in that 
it also had an implicit output subsidy involved with it, and with the 
new carbon tax plan … it is a more even allocation of revenues.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just prior to the COP 21 
in Paris late last year, Alberta’s NDP government unveiled its climate 
change management plan, which is based on the climate change policy 
advisory panel’s final report and includes a legislated emissions limit 
on the oilsands, a carbon price across all sectors, as well as pledges 
to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas operations (DOB, Nov. 22, 
2015).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government’s plan 
includes phasing in carbon pricing in two steps: $20 per tonne 
economy-wide in January 2017 and $30 per tonne economy-wide in January 
2018. The province will set an overall oilsands emission limit of 100 
megatonnes, with provisions for new upgrading and cogeneration. The 
province will also phase out all pollution from burning coal and 
transition to more renewable <b>energy</b> and natural gas generation by 2030.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Winter also argues against subsidizing renewable <b>energy</b>,
 because the carbon tax already makes fossil fuel-based electricity more
 expensive, which should incentivize more renewables to enter the grid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around the same time the 
province was making its climate policy announcement, Winter co-authored a
 report recommending how government might set up a carbon tax, 
suggesting it apply to all <b>energy</b>-based emissions in Alberta, 
along with a revenue-recycling guarantee to minimize any negative 
impacts on households, firms and the provincial economy as a whole (DOB,
 Nov. 26, 2015).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Collaborative governance on carbon pricing a key issue for 2016</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a C.D. Howe 
Institutereport released last month, integrating federal and provincial 
carbon-pricing policies will likely be the key collaborative governance 
issue of 2016. With the recently-elected federal Liberal government 
commitment to allowing provincial carbon pricing freedom, as well as 
emerging provincial policies, the author said this raises the risk of a 
“provincial patchwork” leading to higher costs of doing business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Therefore, suggests the report about the future of Canadian <b>energy</b>
 policy, producers and transportation companies should look to their own
 practices to improve the chances of getting project support. Meanwhile,
 federal and provincial regulators should examine how securities and 
competition policy impact potential <b>energy</b> sector mergers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since <b>social acceptance</b> and getting crude to world markets is a priority for the <b>energy</b>
 sector in 2016, governments must have a robust regulatory system that 
ensures producers can reach those markets in a safe and 
environmentally-friendly manner, noted the report author, and <b>social acceptance</b> requires governments to lead in areas outside the task areas officially assigned to regulators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2016, said the 
institute, Canadian policymakers should provide collaborative carbon 
policies, a robust-but-prompt regulatory review system and an economy 
that encourages an innovative <b>energy</b> sector, as well as competitive electricity prices and a competitive resource tax and fiscal regime.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ROBERT FIFE: Joining us 
from Winnipeg, Conservative natural resources critic Candice Bergen, and
 with me in the studio, NDP environment critic Nathan Cullen. First 
question to you, Ms. Bergen, out in Winnipeg, the Harper government 
completely failed to get any major pipelines built despite nine years in
 power and at a time when oil prices were sky high, so why not give the 
prime minister's approach a chance, you know, to have more environmental
 assessments to get buy-in from the public and First Nations?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CANDICE
 BERGEN (Conservative Natural Resources Critic): Well, first of all, let
 me correct the record on that. Actually, during our tenure between 2006
 and 2015, four major pipelines were built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FIFE: No major pipeline to get Alberta crude oil to tide water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BERGEN: Well, again, one,
 two of them go down to the US, but that's the narrative that the 
Liberals are going on. You know what the Liberals have introduced on 
Wednesday, what they did is they added another layer that was supposed 
to instill Canadian confidence, which is also another term that they use
 is social license, which is kind of an ever moving goalpost. Nobody 
actually knows what social license is. And the very group that they're 
hoping to get on board, First Nations, have come out saying they were 
not consulted at all about the additional consultations that they're 
going to have so they're not happy. But truthfully, the process that 
they're talking about is actually ministerial oversight or 
representation in a new process. There's no description in terms of the 
GHGs that are going to be measured. There's no numbers or any goalpost 
there as far as what proponents are supposed to measure up to, and the 
process truthfully is very, very thorough, it's onerous, it's long. The 
Liberals have been constantly undermining the <span class="companylink">NEB</span>,
 and now they're adding another, this additional roadblock and process 
that nobody is happy with, and at the end of the day no pipelines are 
going to be built in the near future. They're over a year or more 
delayed again, no jobs, no investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FIFE: Mr. Cullen, what's your view on this?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NATHAN CULLEN (NDP 
Environment Critic): The goal is laudable. As Candice and everybody will
 know, building major industrial projects, particularly pipelines, 
because they come with some risk in terms of leaks and whatnot, requires
 public support. It's not 1950, right. The ability to just sort of push 
things through communities and by important environments is no longer 
the same than it was, so public support is important, so the goal is 
right. Is what they are doing the way to do it? I left the briefing with
 a lot more questions than I had answers. Candice did raise the point 
about climate change. Good to include it in the decision because Canada 
just made some big commitments at Paris. You know we had a lot of 
coverage on that. But when I asked the department, I asked the minister,
 so how much is climate important now? Like for a company, if you're a 
company applying, is it one percent of the equation, is it 50 percent of
 what you got? Is there a maximum you're allowed to emit through your 
project? All of that is still unknown. And one thing you'll always hear 
from company reps is certainty matters. I would also suggest certainty 
for the communities matter. And at one point I would argue against 
Candice is the process that's in place right now, it does not meet the 
public test. For an example, there's a Trans Mountain pipeline going to 
Burnaby, the proposed twinning, during the so-called public hearings, 
very few people can actually participate of the public. Second, you 
can't cross-examine the company. So the company puts their evidence 
forward, this is what we're going to do. And now the cabinet, even with 
the changes Mr. Trudeau has made, is going to take that evidence as it 
is without it really having been challenged yet. And to my mind, if 
you're dealing with bad evidence, you're going to make a bad decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FIFE: So, Ms. Bergen, 
some First Nations, as you said, have come out, said they weren't 
properly consulted. But we're in a situation here where many of them are
 opposed to both <b>Energy</b> East or <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>,
 so how do we ever get any First Nation buy-in, and the government seems
 to be giving them a veto over this, because Mr. Trudeau has promised in
 the election campaign that he supports the idea of the UN first rights 
on indigenous people, which is basically a veto?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BERGEN: What we've heard a
 lot are First Nations who are opposed. Now interestingly, though, I was
 actually just in BC a couple of weeks ago at the BC's premiers natural 
resources conference, and I sat down, had a chance to meet with some 
First Nations there, really progressive, recognizing the economic 
benefit of pipelines and how it can benefit them. And I think that the 
companies are doing a better job, and they need to continue doing a 
better job of making the fiscal case, the business case to First Nations
 about the positive impact that these pipelines can have. The truth is, 
environmentally, what we're doing, I mean not so say that the <span class="companylink">NEB</span>
 can't improve the process and that there should always be better 
science and new science, but the fact is Canadian pipelines are built 
very environmentally sound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CULLEN: To say the <span class="companylink">NEB</span> is doing a good job when just this week we had an environment commissioner's report out that said...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BERGEN: Well...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CULLEN: Hold on, let me finish. That of all the conditions that the <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span>
 puts on these pipelines when approving them, saying you can go ahead 
and build but you must do the following things and the company says yes.
 Well they don't follow it. We don't know if they do them or not in 50 
percent or more of the cases. And to say that's good is not great. To 
your point, though, around First Nations, it isn't Mr. Trudeau I would 
argue that's making this decision. It's the Supreme Court just down the 
street here that has passed a number of significant rulings, over years,
 saying that duty to consult and accommodate First Nations is not an 
option anymore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FIFE: No, but does it mean a veto?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CULLEN: In some cases I 
think it does. And the companies that I deal with, because I'm in 
northwestern British Columbia, there's lots of resource projects, 51 
different First Nations groups that are just in my riding, so I've seen 
this in my 11 years that it can go badly and it can go well. From the 
company's perspective, if they're coming in sincerely with an open heart
 and open mind it can happen, because Candice is right, many First 
Nations people are absolutely inclined towards developing resources, but
 they need to do it responsibly.</p>

we have, it's in our national interest, because Alberta has contributed 
so much to our economic fabric of this country, that they deserve to get

 of the things that the Notley government have done to this point 
greatly improves their chances. We talk about that <b>social acceptance</b>.
 The admission that climate change is real and that we're going to do 
something about it, putting a price on carbon which they've done, and 
moving the needle in terms of the public opposition, not just outside of
 Alberta, but also within, to make sure that we're doing these things 
properly and with some sort of consideration of the planet. That's 
important. Do they deserve it? Well they definitely deserve to make 
their case, and they're making a much better case than they were ten 
years ago.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BERGEN: Thank you. Here's what Canadians deserve. We are an <b>energy</b>
 exporting nation. Our neighbours to the south, who are our competitors,
 are lifting export bans on oil. They're building pipelines. They're 
selling their oil. We are now at an unfair and even a greater unfair 
disadvantage with our competitors because of what the Trudeau government
 has just announced, and because we're not building pipelines. So we 
need a pipeline coming out of Alberta. It needs to go right to the east 
coast, not only for Alberta, but for New Brunswick, and for all of 
Canada, and so that we're on a competitive playing field.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With
 a difficult 2015 finally in the rear-view mirror, the C.D. Howe 
Institute says government policy in 2016 will play an increasingly 
important role in getting Canadian <b>energy</b> products to market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a report released 
Thursday, the independent research institute calls on Alberta's NDP 
government to adopt what it calls international best practices for 
collecting <b>energy</b> royalties.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It warns the new Liberal federal government against making major changes to the approval process for <b>energy</b>
 pipelines. And it says Ottawa will need to ensure that provinces 
collaborate when setting carbon-pricing policies. Without proper 
guidance, a "policy patchwork" could lead to higher costs of doing 
business, it says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Few in the Canadian <b>energy</b>
 sector, as well as the people across Canada who depend on it, are going
 to be sad to see 2015 move into the history books," report author 
Benjamin Dachis said in an interview. "Part of the problem the <b>energy</b> sector is facing in 2016 is cyclical - low <b>energy</b>
 prices - but another very large part of it is a structural problem," 
said Dachis, a senior policy analyst at the institute. "There are some 
very key errors that governments have been making that they need to 
correct to put the <b>energy</b> sector on a sound footing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Alberta's royalty 
review panel set to report in coming weeks, the report says Alberta and 
other western provincial governments should replace gross-revenue <b>energy</b> royalties with simpler cash-flow taxes such as those used in Norway and Australia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under a gross-revenue 
system, companies pay the province a share of their gross production 
revenues. The collection method doesn't take into account the real costs
 of production, Dachis said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, cash-flow 
royalties apply to companies only after they have recouped all their 
production costs, allowing them to deduct exploration and development 
costs and carry deductions forward at an appropriate interest rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Alberta, oilsands 
producers already pay a type of cash-flow tax while conventional oil and
 gas producers pay gross-revenue royalties. The entire royalty system 
could be improved, Dachis said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When it comes to good 
design, there are a number of things the province should be thinking 
about, in terms of tweaking the oilsands (royalty) regime and then 
adopting a full reform of the gross-revenue royalties, to adopt a 
best-in-class cash-flow model that allows companies to fully recoup at 
least the taxable component of their investments," he said. "That's 
going to encourage investment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier Rachel Notley has
 said the results of the royalty review panel's work won't be 
controversial. The government has already pledged the current rates will
 stay in place until at least 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The C.D. Howe report says
 the new federal government, which has vowed to review environmental 
assessment processes, should make sure that regulators keep a narrow 
focus when evaluating pipeline projects and other major infrastructure 
proposals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"<b>Social acceptance</b>
 entails more than the regulatory process," Dachis said. "A pipeline 
regulator can't fix the greenhouse gas emissions coming from the 
oilsands. A pipeline regulator can't deal with, at least directly, First
 Nations issues. Governments cannot punt these questions offto the 
regulators."</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TORONTO, Jan. 7, 2016 /CNW/ -&nbsp;Canada's <b>energy</b>
 sector will need to think about more than just low oil prices in 2016. 
There are numerous structural issues facing the sector that will need to
 be overcome, according to a new report from the C.D. Howe Institute. In
 "The Future of Canadian <b>Energy</b> Policy," the second edition of 
the Institute's National Priorities 2016 series, author Benjamin Dachis 
contends that getting elements of <b>energy</b> policy right should be made a national priority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Few in the Canadian <b>energy</b> sector – as well as the many Canadians who depend on it – are sad to see 2015 move into the history books. In 2016, the <b>energy</b> sector will be nervously watching government policies," states Dachis.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report classifies the policy issues facing Canada's <b>energy</b> sector into four main themes, they are:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Global competitiveness of Canada's <b>energy</b> industry: Top of mind for most stakeholders in the Canadian <b>energy</b>
 industry in 2016 will be the global competitiveness of its oil and gas 
and electricity sectors. With Alberta's resource royalty review about to
 conclude in early 2016, it should recommend that the province adopt the
 international best practice of cash-flow tax design. As for 
competiveness in electricity, Ontario should consider the implementation
 of a capacity market, where generators would compete to offer supply at
 a lower price than they do now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*<b>Social acceptance</b> to enable market access for Canadian <b>energy</b>: Getting Canadian <b>energy</b>
 to world markets will remain a key priority in 2016. Having a robust 
regulatory approval system is critical for governments – and the <b>energy</b> sector – to ensure that Canada's <b>energy</b>
 products get to world markets safely and in environmentally friendly, 
socially accepted ways. When it comes to the pipeline review process, 
however, the federal government should focus on minor changes, not major
 reforms, and should be especially wary of changing the review process 
for pipelines already underway. But <b>social acceptance</b> entails more than the regulatory process, and requires governments to take the lead in areas outside the remit of regulators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Collaborative 
governance: Carbon pricing will likely be the key collaborative 
governance issue in 2016, and the new federal government will need to 
tackle a provincial policy patchwork on climate issues. <b>Energy</b> 
producers and transportation companies will also need to look at their 
own practices to improve their chances of getting project support. Both 
federal and provincial regulators will need to examine how their 
securities and competition policies will affect potential mergers in the
 <b>energy</b> sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Innovation: Rather than 
focus innovation and diversification policies on what is physically 
produced in Canada and its provinces, governments should focus on how to
 enable Canadian companies to become global leaders in the specific 
technologies they are best at applying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dachis concludes that "in
 2016, governments across Canada should act to provide a competitive 
resource tax and fiscal regime, competitive electricity prices, a robust
 but prompt regulatory review system, collaborative carbon policies, and
 an economy that encourages an innovative <b>energy</b> sector."</p>

 Dec. 1, 2015 /CNW/ -&nbsp;With the new federal government committed to 
reviewing the approval process for major resource projects, a key focus 
should be on encouraging stronger social partnerships between 
stakeholders, according to a new C.D. Howe Institute report. In "From 
'Social Licence' to 'Social Partnership': Promoting Shared Interests for
 Resource and Infrastructure Development," authors Geoffrey Hale and 
Yale Belanger identify best practices for successful community 
engagement by companies, industries and governments that have a proven 
track record of success.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Social partnerships have become a key element for <b>energy</b> and related infrastructure development," commented Hale. "Failure to secure <b>social acceptance</b>
 increases the risk of a project not coming to market," added Belanger. 
"Communities that don't feel their needs are well understood have 
greater incentives to form alliances with outside activist groups that 
pursue much stricter development limits as part of a broader ideological
 agenda."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authors provide 
examples of successful multi-stakeholder "synergy" groups, 
government-led initiatives and "corridor" coalitions of groups across 
extended areas. They recommend a virtual handbook of best practices for 
industry, regulators and community leaders in the following areas:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Building 
Multi-Stakeholder Groups and Networks: Local or regional industry 
working groups including industry representatives provide a valuable 
means of strengthening connections with local governments and 
communities, public health authorities and local emergency response 
professionals. These groups reduce risks, address community concerns, 
and respond more effectively to occasional emergencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Multi-Jurisdictional 
Projects: Multi-jurisdictional initiatives require parallel processes 
that respect legal, institutional and social differences in various 
jurisdictions. The authors find successful examples of formal 
multi-jurisdictional advisory processes in British Columbia that could 
inform future negotiations elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Engaging First Nations 
and Aboriginal Communities: Consultation prior to detailed project 
design or approval has become a central factor influencing First 
Nations' acceptance of resource projects affecting traditional lands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <b>energy</b> 
sector's involvement in hundreds of diverse communities points to a 
number of lessons. Provincial and federal governments and regulators can
 do more by promoting multi-stakeholder groups and disclosing more about
 emergency response plans. Industry bodies should promote cultures of 
continuous improvement reinforced by benchmarks and internal reporting 
requirements that demonstrate adherence. <b>Energy</b> firms themselves 
can look to international certifications of their processes of social 
partnership, or pool resources to achieve similar objectives.</p>

 Finland, Nov. 3, 2015 /CNW/ -&nbsp;FinnMin, the Finnish Mining 
Association, today announced that it will adopt the Towards Sustainable 
Mining (TSM) initiative, a corporate social responsibility (CSR) program
 developed by the Mining Association of Canada (MAC) to improve 
environmental and social practices in the mining industry. This is the 
first time TSM has been adopted by a mining association outside of 
Canada. The agreement was signed at the Fennoscandian Exploration and 
Mining Conference (FEM).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FinnMin and many of its 
member companies chose TSM, as it is the most advanced initiative in the
 mining industry. TSM will contribute to the transparency and 
accountability of the mining industry and will, therefore, enhance <b>social acceptance</b> among the different stakeholders in Finnish civil society.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"TSM
 has proven its effectiveness in Canada, and we at FinnMin believe it 
will be a useful tool for Finnish mining companies when the companies 
develop their sustainability reporting in the future," comments Markus 
Ekberg, Chairman of FinnMin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FinnMin's adoption of TSM
 is part of a larger commitment of MAC's to freely share TSM with other 
countries seeking tools to improve the environmental and social 
performance of their mining industry, including engagement with civil 
society and enhanced transparency and accountability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are very pleased that
 FinnMin has, after a three-year multi-stakeholder process of its own 
that explored options for improving its mining sector's performance, has
 chosen TSM," said Pierre Gratton, President and CEO, MAC. "This is a 
significant milestone for TSM, and could be the start of it becoming a 
global standard."&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The adoption of the TSM 
framework in Finland presents a great opportunity to share the many 
lessons learned from over a decade of building standards in Canada, and 
no doubt we will also be able to learn from their implementation 
experiences," said Alan Young, member of MAC's Community of Interest 
Advisory Panel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finland has already taken
 a key step in the implementation of TSM with the creation of the 
Finnish Network for Sustainable Mining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The agreement between 
FinnMin and MAC is very good news for the Finnish Network for 
Sustainable Mining. It represents the first step in the implementation 
of a new sustainability standard in the Finnish mining sector. I trust 
that most mining companies will join the standard within the next few 
years," says Eero Yrjö-Koskinen, Secretary General of the network.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labour
 is a scarce, expensive resource in the oilsands, and it’s an issue that
 can be helped by modularization, a recent Oilsands Review speaker 
series event heard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“How are we addressing 
the challenges? I would like to think that we are addressing them with 
innovation and execution — stealing from other industries and stealing 
with pride,” said Simon Nottingham, general manager at <span class="companylink">Fluor Canada Ltd</span>. “We are doing that with our 3rd Gen Modular Execution.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 3rd Gen approach splits projects into process blocks and moves them 
into designing modules, which in part maximizes the transfer of labour 
hours from a low-efficiency, high-cost field environment to 
higher-efficiency, lower-cost module fabrication yards. According to 
Nottingham, the notion was “stolen with pride” from the offshore sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Moving that design and 
execution philosophy into northern Alberta, that is how we are providing
 innovation,” he said. “We can get to a predictable design. I know that 
our modular yards and fabrication facilities can start executing much 
more efficiently.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Repeatable steel 
structural design deployed in the oilsands would certainly benefit those
 in the field, added Nottingham. “They would not have to redo all of the
 jigs and look up the oil specs for each different modular. Imagine what
 we could do with that in terms of a fabrication concept and getting 
that into the design.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, noted 
Nottingham, convincing clients to implement offshore modularization 
methods in northern Alberta is a challenge, even if these methods make a
 lot of sense and putting pumps on steel is proven to work on platforms 
in the North Sea or off the coast of Africa, or in the shipbuilding 
industry where there are no foundations or piles for the pumps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I really think there are some real opportunities, but we are slow adopters here in the oilsands industry,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although there are 
well-known challenges with oilsands development, Nottingham believes 
that Alberta has one of the best, largest hydrocarbon reserves in the 
world. However, maximizing the returns on that potential requires 
tackling various challenges, including environmental concerns and <b>social acceptance</b> associated with the industry, as well as the human resources issue, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are a great, 
innovative province that is blessed with a huge resource, but with about
 [only] four million people, and so it is very difficult to build on 
those great plans.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Innovation through the downturn</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Siemens Canada Limited</span>
 (sponsor for the Speaker Series event) is looking for technology 
leaders in the Canadian oil and gas space to be enablers and motivators 
of innovation, said senior account manager John Lusty. “We want to 
support those innovators in order to ensure that our oil and gas 
industry becomes more resilient, and so that it can respond to the next 
downturn without so much of the severe cost cutting measures that we see
 today.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: “We want to 
make sure that as this cycle repeats itself — because it will and we all
 know that — we are better positioned to be able to use innovation and 
technology, and link together our physical assets and digital assets to 
make our processes more efficient, and our organizations more resilient 
to whatever challenges may come.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the <b>energy</b> 
sector and commodity markets are going through tough times, and press 
coverage of the sector seems rather grim, Lusty said this is not the 
first industry recently to experience such a challenge. In 2007-08, the 
North American auto market went through what Lusty calls “an existential
 threat.” However, he added, those same companies are now thriving, 
surviving and more successful than before the global recession.</p>

 Corp., by Q3 2016, will not have any water pump or jerrican taking 
water from irrigation channels — or at least that’s the goal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We would like to get off
 freshwater and we would like to use all our produced water for all our 
needs,” Krzysztof Palka, chief strategist of sustainability, innovation 
and operational leadership, told this week’s Canadian Shale Water 
Recycling and Reuse 2015 Congress. “For some of the operations requiring
 freshwater, we would add additional processing for a smaller volume 
from all those oilfield operations.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He
 added: “We don’t have to go all the way to produce water that has the 
quality of potable water or irrigation water. We can just go to as low 
as we can to ensure that we can use the water in our downhole 
[operations], without running into compatibility issues.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A small producer of about
 2,300 bbls per day in the dry region of southern Alberta, Imaginea 
currently satisfies its water needs from irrigation channels. In 2009, 
Palka noted, it took 0.14 bbls of water to produce one bbl of oil, and 
the amount of water required to produce oil is constantly increasing. 
Once injected into disposal wells, water used in oilfield operations is 
removed from the hydrologic cycle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If every year we draw a 
little bit more water from the system, then it is really in principle 
not a good thing, and so we really have to figure out something,” he 
said, adding the reduction of operational freshwater usage is a 
certainly simpler, more attainable environmental goal than reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions. “This may be something that is maybe worth 
exploring for various reasons, including <b>social acceptance</b>.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Palka, for 
every bbl of oil produced in Imaginea’s operations, there is far more 
brackish water produced along with it. “If you think about it, just 
based on the nature of oil to water that we produce, we are a water 
producer. We take and sell the oil and gas, but really we are in the 
business of producing water.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Considering the amount of
 water that then gets injected into the formation as pressure 
maintenance, he said, there is much water producers discard that could 
actually be used for operations if it could be cleaned up enough. His 
company realizes that if it could even use a portion of the water it 
produces for further hydrocarbon production, then it would mean the 
company would use less to no irrigation channel freshwater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Imagine that we produce 
10,000 cubic metres of water every day with 50,000 [total dissolved 
solids], we take a small portion of the water, say 150 cubic metres per 
day, and we process it and get 100 cubic metres of irrigation-quality 
water with a very low concentration of all the solids, then we take the 
concentrated brine and reintroduce it back into the water-injection 
stream that we are injecting to maintain reservoir pressure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It allows us to produce 
more oil, and suddenly the impact on injection water is fairly minute. 
There are no issues of compatibility. We effectively do not have any 
water we have to dispose, and we produce key water that we can use for 
operations and then maybe share the balance.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among those companies offering potential freshwater alternatives for Imaginea is <span class="companylink">Saltworks Technologies Inc</span>.,
 which has a fleet of mobile pilots and manufactures desalination and 
treatment plants to deal with some of the most complex wastewaters and 
brines. “It is basically a low-temperature humidifying and dehumidifying
 cycle,” Palka said. “It is very good, because it can be used on this 
brine and will produce salts as part of the process.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In total, according to 
Palka, the Saltworks option would cost his company about $11 per cubic 
metre of freshwater created, which he believes to be not too expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another company, <span class="companylink">Altela Inc</span>., uses evaporation and condensation, assisted with steam, to turn produced water into freshwater. Because it uses more <b>energy</b>, the <span class="companylink">Altela</span>
 method produces more emissions and costs more money than the Saltworks 
option. However, while it costs $30 per cubic metre of freshwater 
created, and it makes less water per day than the other sample, Palka 
said freshwater from <span class="companylink">Altela</span> is stream ready.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirdly, Atlantis 
Technologies uses patented radial deionization technology, which passes 
salty water between two oppositely-charged supercapacitors that attract 
ions from the water. Leaving within a dielectric layer, the ions pass 
through a charge-specific membrane coating, and are adsorbed onto the 
surface. Once filled with ions, capacitor polarity is reversed and the 
ions are discharged back into the dielectric spacer and removed from the
 system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is very simple, it uses a relatively low amount of <b>energy</b>,”
 Palka told the Canadian Business Conferences event. He added: “It’s 
modularized, it’s standardized, and it can be made portable and mobile.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Imaginea could even 
just partially clean that water and reintroduce it into the reservoir 
for oil and gas operations, Palka emphasized, then maybe the company 
could avoid some of the costs from producing brackish water along with 
oil in the first place, as well as save some money on water disposal.</p>

 suitable access to natural gas and associated liquids at a 
cost-competitive price, there is the potential for an expansion of the 
Canadian petrochemical industry, says a new study by the Canadian <b>Energy</b> Research Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When you look at the 
elements that create a competitive advantage, feedstock is very 
important and in terms of feedstock, Western Canada is well positioned 
to be competitive,” Allan Fogwill, president and chief executive officer
 of CERI, said in an interview. “The challenge is access to markets.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As
 products from western Canadian petrochemical products cannot be 
absorbed within the region, they will require export markets and the 
means of getting the product to market, he said. That likely will mean 
rail, depending upon the product, given the increasing difficulty in 
obtaining pipeline approvals, Fogwill suggested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, Examining the
 Expansion Potential of the Petrochemical Industry in Canada, also 
identifies other challenges that need to be addressed, including the 
development of offshore markets for natural gas to increase the supply 
of natural gas liquids, especially ethane and the need for added 
infrastructure for separating sufficient ethane from incremental gas 
production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian 
petrochemical industry is centred mainly in Alberta (Joffre and Fort 
Saskatchewan) and Ontario (Sarnia) with 75 per cent of installed 
capacity used to convert ethane to ethylene (olefin-based). There is a 
limited aromatics-based industry in Montreal using feedstock from the <span class="companylink">Suncor <b>Energy</b> Inc</span>. refinery. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are competitive with 
other areas of the world,” he said. While he acknowledged that 
competitiveness is less today because of the smaller gap between the 
price of oil (which most countries use as feedstock) and the price of 
natural gas used in Canada, “it indicates it should be an area that 
needs to be considered when petrochemical companies are considering 
their next investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next step, said 
Fogwill, would be for CERI to compare the costs of petrochemical plants 
in specific North American locations, including the Gulf Coast, Western 
Canada, Ontario and Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Olefins and aromatics, 
the two major basic building blocks of the petrochemical industry, are 
used as feedstock in derivatives or intermediate plants to produce 
end-use products including various grades of plastics, resins, fibres, 
and solvents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Alberta, where NOVA ChemicalsCanada and <span class="companylink">DOW Chemical</span>
 Canada ULC are the major players, the major sources of petrochemical 
feedstock include NGLs (mainly ethane) from gas processing plants and 
off-gas plants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crackers, though, 
have a small degree of flexibility to crack some volumes of propane when
 ethane supply is constrained or when propane offers a cost advantage. 
“This highlights the fact that the petrochemical industry in Alberta is 
reliant on supply of NGLs, primarily ethane, which is tied to production
 and processing of natural gas,” said the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the&nbsp; 
olefins (primarily propylene but also some ethylene) produced during the
 crude oil refining process, other processes such as propane 
dehydrogenation (PDH) which produces propylene are becoming more 
prominent, it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because olefins generally
 are produced in a gaseous state, there usually is downstream 
integration of derivatives with the cracker generally producing enough 
ethylene to meet downstream demand. And because ethylene, similar to 
ethane, is neither easy to transport nor store, ethylene crackers are 
usually built in conjunction with ethylene derivative plants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ontario, about 60 per 
cent of the province’s petrochemical capacity is based on olefins and 40
 per cent on aromatics (toluene and benzene). Historically, feedstock 
for olefins facilities has been sourced from Western Canada (NGLs and 
crude oil/condensate) and local refineries (liquid petroleum gas or 
LPG). More recently, NGLs (primarily ethane and propane) are being 
imported from the United States to feed steam crackers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aromatics-based 
facilities sourced their feedstock from local refineries (which in turn 
source their crude oil from Western Canada and overseas) and local 
olefin crackers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CERI said its study 
demonstrates that the principal consideration in determining whether a 
region is cost competitive is the feedstock price and second, feedstock 
availability in sufficient quantity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North America, which 
along with the Middle East uses natural gas as &nbsp;feedstock, has an 
advantage in that area because the rest of the world uses mainly 
oil-based feedstocks in petrochemical production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Middle East has the 
greatest cost advantage but this is due to incentives making their 
feedstocks artificially low, according to the CERI study, which based 
its analysis on 2012 numbers.&nbsp; Canada and the United States are the
 next most competitive regions, followed by Latin America and some parts
 of the Asia Pacific region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the report noted
 that recent information regarding investment costs indicates the cost 
differentials between Canada and the U.S. and globally between ethane 
and naphtha-based processes are narrowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report from Wood 
Mackenzie analyzed the cost of ethylene production at various oil and 
natural gas prices. At $4 per mmBtu for natural gas, the ethylene 
production cost is approximately 15 cents per pound, increasing to 20-25
 cents per pound at $7 per mmBtu for natural gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While an August 2015 
Brent crude price in the $50 to $60 per bbl range would suggest a 
naphtha-based price for ethylene in Asia of less than 30 cents per 
pound, North American ethane based ethylene is cost competitive at 
between 10 and 20 cents per pound, the consultants determined. However, 
transportation cost to the growing Asian market would increase this 
cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the long-term, though,
 there is a structural price advantage in North America as a result of 
feedstock costs, according to CERI.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Feedstock availability is
 another advantage with the total supply of ethane available to Western 
Canada forecast to increase over time, it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The total supply of 
ethane available to Western Canada is projected to rise to 956,000 bbls 
per day by 2030 with the greatest projected growth from British Columbia
 gas as a result of LNG projects. CERI assumes that three LNG terminals 
will be built, totalling 5.4 bcf per day of capacity and operating at an
 annual average of 4.8 bcf per day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ethane also could be 
extracted in Western Canada from gas streaming, new straddle plants or 
LNG ethane extraction, highlighting the importance of both extraction 
and end-use infrastructure, the study suggested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For olefins and their 
derivatives, the most important factor in global prices is the cost 
structure of the marginal producer which is required to satisfy a given 
level of demand (usually the highest cost producers), according to the 
study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This means that the 
feedstock cost advantage generally stays with the low cost producers and
 translates into higher margins, but not necessarily lower olefin and 
derivative prices,” it said. “Higher margins however, can fuel 
re-investment and expansion cycles.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study estimated that 
Canada has up to an additional 350,000 bbls per day of ethane which 
would provide sufficient supply for two to three additional world scale 
crackers if all the ethane in the natural gas were to be recovered, 
rather than the approximately 50 per cent currently recovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plant capacity 
utilization in Canada is currently high, averaging above 90 per cent, 
said the report. While there is some excess capacity, it remains to be 
seen if the utilization rate can be moved up to the 95 to 100 per cent 
range, it said.&nbsp; “If not, one observation is that there is no 
significant excess capacity at this time in Canada,” it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Petrochemical companies 
globally are responding to disruptions in supply and demand by adapting 
their business models, which include improving scale, operational 
efficiencies, and value chain integration to drive down costs, the study
 noted. &nbsp;A 2012 study by the consulting firm <span class="companylink">KPMG</span>
 indicated that chemical manufacturing in Canada costs are about three 
per cent lower than in the United States and about seven per cent less 
than in Japan, it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, “this assessment
 does not include the cost advantage to Canada with respect to 
feedstocks, nor the added cost in Western Canada to move petrochemicals 
or their derivatives to tidewater,” the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market access remains a 
challenge if expansion is to occur in Canada, CERI said. While the 
petrochemical sector has been built to serve the domestic and U.S. 
markets, they show little potential for growth either due to a lack of 
increase in demand or increased capacity in the U.S. to serve that 
market, it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overseas market access 
would be needed to facilitate expansion of the sector in Canada. In the 
east, this access challenge is due to the far distance between producers
 and the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the west, the 
challenge is to move product from Alberta to the B.C. coast, most likely
 by rail. Although pipeline access would be cheaper, the <b>social acceptance</b>
 of pipelines is difficult to obtain, the study suggested. 
&nbsp;According to the 2015 chemical industry update of the Conference 
Boardof Canada, one weakness of the chemicals industry is the decline in
 access to rail transportation and insufficient pipeline capacity, which
 threatens the industry’s cost structure, it said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2.75-megawatt turbine

dwarf those of 30 years ago, when the average turbine had a diameter of 
15 metres and pumped out all of 50 kilowatts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Hornung, president of the Canadian Wind <b>Energy</b> Association, said this evolution in size has been critical for the industry's growth because it allows for more <b>energy</b> to be captured more efficiently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Generally, the further 
off the ground you get, the better the quality of the wind resource. 
It's more consistent, it's often stronger, which means there's more <b>energy</b> to capture out of the wind."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said because wind turbines have become more productive, they can also operate in more places.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're now able to build 
productive wind turbines in areas where 10 to 15 years ago you never 
would have been able to because you never would have been able to 
capture enough <b>energy</b> to make it worthwhile."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the sheer size of 
the newest turbines are the most noticeable advancement, Hornung said 
every aspect of the technology has been improving, including rotor 
shape, the use of carbon fibre for lighter blades, and the ability to 
rotate the blades automatically to capture as much wind as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That kind of progress has helped make wind the most installed form of <b>energy</b> in Canada in the past five years and has driven the cost of constructing wind turbines down by 50 to 60 per cent, said Hornung.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ward Marshall, director of business development at Pattern <b>Energy</b>, said equipment and computer modelling to optimize the use of that equipment have led to dramatic improvements in performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You have the ability to get all the oink out of the pig," said Marshall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while the latest turbines will allow Pattern to capture more <b>energy</b>, Marshall thinks they may be reaching a limit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's always this issue of how big is too big."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The logistics of actually
 getting massive turbines to sites are getting more complicated, 
especially in hillier areas of B.C. and Quebec, said Marshall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some turbines are being designed to be built more onsite, but that adds to costs, said Marshall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's also the problem 
of social acceptability and public resistance to large towers on the 
landscape, said Hornung. "In essence, how big can you build in an area 
where people are living?" But so far those challenges haven't stopped 
Canada's wind capacity from growing, with more than 10,000 installed 
megawatts today compared with about 300 megawatts in 2003, said Hornung.</p>

being hounded by law enforcement agencies for the device, which has also
 generated interest from transport, shipping, mining and <b>energy</b> industries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He claims Cannabix is first to develop a pot breathalyzer, though Colorado's <span class="companylink">Lifeloc Technologies</span>, researchers at Western State University and a pair of <span class="companylink">University of Akron</span> students have similar devices in the works.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such breathalyzers are a response to pot's increased <b>social acceptance</b> and the need for a tool to determine if workers can safely perform their jobs, Mahli said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, <span class="companylink">Health Canada</span>
 expects the number of medical marijuana users to rise to 450,000 by 
2024, up from 37,000 in 2013. Mahli predicts use of pot will surpass 
that of alcohol. Mahli said urine and saliva tests can detect past drug 
use, but don't necessarily demonstrate a worker's ability to work a 
given shift, which is where the breathalyzer comes in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At issue, however, is whether such a device can reliably tell if a worker is fit for duty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Presence of THC and even
 the use of THC in the last couple of hours tells you only that the 
person has ingested THC in the last couple of hours," said Kirk Tousaw, a
 lawyer who works primarily with the medical marijuana industry. "It 
doesn't tell you whether or not that person is impaired ... if their 
performance is going to be affected."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tousaw said he's seen 
hysteria around marijuana use in safety-conscious industries such as 
trucking and construction, and a lack of science about how marijuana 
impairs users - particularly medical or experienced users - has Tousaw 
concerned such a test could harm safe, efficient workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Micheal Vonn, policy director for the B.C. Civil Liberties Association, echoed Tousaw's concerns around detecting impairment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The trick always with these drug recognition tests is the ability to test for actual impairment, as opposed to use," Vonn said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What we don't want to 
see is the kind of tool that is so broad-based that it would show that 
someone used marijuana on the weekend, that they are a medical cannabis 
user and that any other kind of cannabis had been ingested that does not
 constitute the issue, which is impairment."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Calgary Stampede is 
at a close, but a new stampede is just beginning. Alberta's NDP 
government is ushering in policy changes to the oil-and-gas sector with 
unprecedented scope and speed. It will profoundly impact how the 
province – indeed, the country – governs the naturalresource economy and
 wrestles with its <b>energy</b> superpower status. As Premier Rachel 
Notley recently explained to a group of international investors, “there 
is always more than you suspect beneath the surface" in Alberta.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hopefully, the province likes what it finds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry is running hard to keep up with the restructuring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province's emissions framework, royalties, corporate taxes and <b>energy</b>
 regulator are under review. One of these changes would be significant. 
All together may be overwhelming, particularly while flirting with 
recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uncertain or onerous regulatory reforms create risk at a time of disconcerting market conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capital is mobile, even 
skittish, about oil prices and the Greek situation. China's turbulence 
is another dark cloud on the horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exploration and 
production companies with diversified asset bases can redirect dollars 
outside Alberta. There are abundant tight oil and shale-gas investment 
opportunities in the United States and elsewhere. Policies resulting in 
new operational costs have impacts on investment and drilling. Ensuring a
 competitive royalty, credit and incentive structure – even relative to 
Saskatchewan and British Columbia – remains critical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Premier appears to 
understand that economics matter. To run Alberta successfully, a 
government must acknowledge that the province is resource-reliant and 
that its role is to facilitate job creation. Ms. Notley showed this in a
 recent speech to the Stampede Investment Forum, calling the oil sands a
 “tremendous asset" that merit continued investment and expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a previous Alberta 
government introduced the Specified Gas Emitters Regulation in 2007, it 
was the first greenhouse gas (GHG) pricing policy in North America. 
Alberta's climatechange regime needs updating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are a number of 
models on offer. B.C. imposes a tax per tonne of CO2e (carbon dioxide 
equivalent) on fossil fuels. Quebec launched a cap-and-trade system. 
Ontario established a midterm GHG pollution-reduction target, and is 
moving toward cap-and-trade. All three provinces support a Western 
Climate Initiative that, along with California, is pursuing a broader 
regional cap-and-trade program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No model reflects the 
full costs of navigating GHG restrictions in an oil-and-gas-dependent 
province. Nor are they perfect in themselves. Carbon-tax and 
capand-trade methodologies both add burdens for new facilities and 
barriers to investment with high net present value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps above all, Alberta must demonstrate leadership on national <b>energy</b>
 issues. Market access, First Nations, GHGs and access to capital are 
examples where regional interests or interjurisdictional differences 
have impeded Alberta's success. Ms. Notley's government will also need 
to work collaboratively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engagement with other 
provinces and the federal government – irrespective of political stripe –
 prior to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris is one 
opportunity. Decision making in the interests of Albertans, not the 
federal NDP or its election timetable, is another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stability in the <b>energy</b>
 sector and provincial revenue allow the Premier to address her 
priorities in health, education and infrastructure. Her government is 
undertaking some of the most important policy reviews in the province's 
history. The implications for Alberta and the entire country are fraught
 with risk, but contain tremendous opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province can assist the <b>social acceptance</b> of <b>energy</b>
 infrastructure necessary for Canada to remain an international economic
 leader. Alberta can also provide leadership on what kind of <b>energy</b> superpower Canada wants to be, and at what price.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta <b>Energy</b> Regulator's decisions impact billions of dollars in <b>energy</b>
 development and investment. Premier Notley is set to review the AER's 
mandate. Her government is undertaking an ambitious and comprehensive 
examination of Alberta's <b>energy</b> regulatory framework. A new 
policy direction is expected to address the Premier's concerns about the
 AER's role as both "a promoter of <b>energy</b> and the primary vehicle of environmental protection." This includes a potential split of the AER.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Irrespective of whatever 
potential benefits may result from a split AER, the uncertainty of a 
restructured regulator - for the second time in less than three years - 
creates risk for <b>energy</b> companies, investors, and the province as
 a whole. It is also unclear whether such dramatic reform is necessary 
to achieve the government's goals.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Changes
 to the scope of the AER and its predecessors have a long history in 
Alberta. Proposals for a "one-window" regulatory approval system span 
well over a decade. On December 10, 2012, a prior administration passed 
the Responsible <b>Energy</b> Development Act (REDA) - legislation that 
created a single regulator. The AER became operational in June 2013. It 
assumed the regulatory functions, from project application to 
reclamation, previously administered by the <b>Energy</b> Resources 
Conservation Board, and Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource 
Development. Reorganization was completed in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes under REDA 
responded to complaints of inconsistent and duplicative procedures for 
resource development. REDA established a "one-stop" approval process. 
REDA - as well as federal legislation of the same era, including 
procedural streamlining amendments under <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span> Act - attempted to reduce the time and expense required to obtain regulatory approvals, and to make the Canadian <b>energy</b> industry more competitive and attractive for investment dollars globally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under REDA, oil and gas policy development rests with the provincial government. Alberta <b>Energy</b>
 now drives the AER's priorities. The achievement of government policy 
outcomes is undertaken by the AER. All of this represents significant 
change from what was previously an independent provincial <b>energy</b> 
regulator. If the government now seeks to effect further change to the 
mandate of the AER, the regulator does not necessarily need to be split.
 Rather, a new policy direction may be provided pursuant to section 67 
of REDA - with a shortcoming. A criticism of REDA generally, and of 
section 67 in particular, is that it reduced the AER's independence from
 government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The AER's stated mandate 
since the 2013 reorganization and the passage of REDA has been "to 
provide for the efficient, safe, orderly and environmentally responsible
 development of <b>energy</b> resources in Alberta through the 
Regulator's regulatory activities." This includes "the protection of the
 environment" and "the conservation and management of water, including 
the wise allocation and use of water." Premier Notley's chief concern is
 that the AER's environmental oversight and <b>energy</b> regulatory 
approval processes are inconsistent, based on her interpretation that 
the regulator's "overarching mandate is to promote <b>energy</b> development."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the relatively 
short timeframe REDA has been in force, it remains to be seen how 
effectively the objectives of environmental responsibility and resource 
development are co-managed. It is too early to assess the legitimacy of 
criticisms that a single regulator removes environmental checks and 
balances and shifts the AER's role to one of simply permitting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Changes to the AER's 
structure are among the most significant reforms proposed by the new 
government. The AER's mandate impacts the <b>energy</b> industry's 
ability to obtain project approvals, secure financing and assess 
jurisdictional and regulatory risk. From an industry perspective, 
potential implications of a split regulator include lack of clarity, 
duplication, and project delays. However, it may also facilitate 
increased <b>social acceptance</b> for Canadian <b>energy</b> project development and result in greater focus on, and management of, each aspect of <b>energy</b> regulation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A refreshed policy 
approach can be implemented through section 67 of REDA - albeit with 
effects on regulatory independence - and staffing changes. Some of the 
AER's recent innovative approaches, including cumulative impacts 
management and play-based regulation, may also provide an existing 
platform for the government to address environmental oversight concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Energy</b> Minister 
McCuaig-Boyd stated there will be "an announcement in the next few 
weeks" about a review of the AER and a wider look at Alberta's <b>energy</b>
 regulations. In a short period of time the new government is poised to 
address several critical pillars of Alberta's economy, including 
royalties, taxes and greenhouse gas. The AER is now among them - with 
implications for the entire country.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November 2004, 
Beckwell and her wife Lisa became the first same-sex couple to be 
legally married in Saskatchewan. On Friday she was taken back to that 
time, as the <span class="companylink">United States Supreme Court</span> declared same-sex couples have a right to marry anywhere in the U.S.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I
 got goosebumps just thinking about what it was like for us, waiting for
 those court decisions and the emotions afterward," Beckwell said 
shortly after hearing about the decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since same-sex marriage 
became legal in Saskatchewan, 436 same-sex couples - 163 male and 273 
female - have tied the knot in the province, according to eHealth 
Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when the change came
 in Canada, Beckwell said she remembers thinking the U.S. queer 
community had a much longer road ahead. She wasn't sure she would see 
marriage legalized south of the border in her lifetime, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's kind of surreal to imagine that, 10 years later, here we are."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday's 5-4 ruling means
 the 14 states with bans on gay marriage will have to stop enforcing 
them. Those states will also have to recognize gay marriages performed 
elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beckwell said the change here more than a decade ago helped shift people's understanding of LGBT people and culture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even being able to go 
from referring to Lisa as my partner to being able to, and have other 
people, refer to her as my wife - it's a very subtle shift, but it 
matters," she said. She talked about marching in Saskatoon's pride 
parade more than a decade ago and hearing people say it was 
inappropriate for children to see gay people. This year, the parade 
included plenty of children whose parents wanted to teach them about 
diversity and acceptance, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Marriage is one of the factors that has allowed that conversation to happen."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Saskatchewan people
 aren't directly affected by Friday's ruling, some same-sex couples have
 hesitated to travel to states where their marriage isn't recognized, 
according to Garnet Woloschuk, program manager at OUTSaskatoon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I know for some people, they don't really feel safe going to certain states," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He called the ruling a positive step, but noted legal recognition is not the same thing as true <b>social acceptance</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Women have been equal 
under the law for decades, but if you talk to many women, would they say
 they feel equal?" Beckwell echoed that sentiment and mentioned other 
marginalized groups, such as transgender people, who still struggle for 
recognition. With marriage legally protected, she said <b>energy</b> should now be devoted to other causes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With that in mind, 
Friday's news was still worth celebrating, and served as a landmark 
example of the progress that has been made, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When I came out nearly 
20 years ago, (same-sex) marriage wasn't legal anywhere. That's kind of a
 profound thing to think about." strembath@thestarphoenix.com(

</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There
 were four ways a company could comply with Alberta's GHG framework: (i)
 improvements to their operations; (ii) Alberta-based carbon offset 
credits; (iii) emission performance credits; and (iv) contributions to 
the Climate Change and Emissions Management Fund into which an emitter 
paid $15 per tonne of CO2e emissions over target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Alberta, companies 
could buy offset credits as a replacement for improving the 
environmental performance in their own operations - for example, a tonne
 of upgrader pollution is cancelled out by a tonne of wind-farm 
reductions. Given the relative lack of exchange opportunities in 
Alberta, the province's offset market historically faced challenges. The
 fund became the preferred vehicle for emissions reduction, largely 
because it guaranteed a ceiling price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As previous 
administrations acknowledged, Alberta's climate-change regime needed 
refreshment. The Specified Gas Emitters Regulation was created as a 
flexible scheme, to be "reviewed for ongoing relevancy and necessity." 
It was meant to be responsive to technological changes and policy 
harmonization. The chief criticism of the Specified Gas Emitters 
Regulation was its intensity-based approach, which did not generate 
reductions in absolute emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, significant 
change arrived. The province's new environment and parks minister, 
Shannon Phillips, announced Specified Gas Emitters Regulation would be 
extended until at least the end of 2017. The results are significant and
 - in Alberta - unprecedented. Any facility that emits 100,000 tonnes or
 more of GHGs per year will now be required to reduce their CO2 
emissions intensity by 15 per cent in 2016 and 20 per cent by 2017. They
 will also have to ultimately pay $30 for every tonne of CO2 released 
over that level. Compliance mechanisms continue with the previous suite 
of options. The impacts to industry of what amounts to a new operating 
cost remain to be fully determined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More change is coming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the next three months, the <span class="companylink">University of Alberta</span>'s
 Andrew Leach will lead an advisory panel to review the province's 
climate strategy. Unlike in 2007, an assessment of GHG policy requires 
co-ordination with other jurisdictions. The Alberta government must be 
selective in its long-term climate-change initiatives. No current 
provincial model reflects the realities of navigating GHG restrictions 
in an oiland-gas dependant province. Nor are they perfect models in 
themselves. Both carbon tax and cap-and-trade methodologies add burdens 
for new oil and gas facilities and barriers to investment with high net 
present value costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Specified Gas 
Emitters Regulation started to show its age. Alberta is still the single
 largest GHG emitting province in Canada. It permits higher annual 
emission levels than more recently implemented GHG regimes. Moreover, 
the value of Alberta's Specified Gas Emitters Regulation as a currency 
to advance the province's commercial interests abroad - in Washington on
 Keystone XL or Brussels on the EU Fuel Quality Directive - was long 
spent. The regulation was never fully understood in foreign capitals, 
let alone Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The role of the federal 
government remains critical, albeit to date, limited. A 2013 "40/40 
plan" - reducing emissions by 40 per cent per barrel of oil and charging
 companies exceeding emission limits a $40/tonne penalty - receded 
quickly. On May 15, 2015, Environment Minister Leona Aglukkaq announced a
 reduction in Canada's GHG emissions to 70 per cent of the 2005 
Canada-wide levels by the year 2030 - without placing regulations on the
 oilsands. Canada's federal opposition parties are vague on what their 
approaches to climate change would be, and the results of an upcoming 
election uncertain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Irrespective of which 
party is in power nationally, provinces' co-ordination on climate change
 must acknowledge Ottawa's role. Notley stated as much in last Monday's 
Speech from the Throne. A weakness of the Canadian <b>Energy</b> 
Strategy, a cornerstone of previous interprovincial engagement on GHG 
policy, was that it largely ignored the federal government. However, the
 premiers must also resist playing climate change politics with Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From royalties to refineries, the Notley government is poised to substantially impact <b>energy</b>
 and environmental policy in Alberta and beyond its borders. A refreshed
 national engagement on climate change need not be a threat to the 
Alberta economy. A stable framework for GHG emissions - which many in 
the oil and gas industry themselves have asked for - may provide 
necessary clarity for investment and growth. It may also facilitate 
something more elusive, the <b>social acceptance</b> to develop pipeline infrastructure necessary for Canada to remain an international economic leader, rather than simply an <b>energy</b> superpower-in-waiting.</p>

 Notley's New Democratic Party brought the Progressive Conservatives' 
near-44-year rule in Alberta to an abrupt end with a platform that 
pledged to raise corporate taxes, review oil and gas royalties and cut 
greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But rather than tinkering
 with royalty rates and corporate taxes, some analysts say the new 
government should train its sights on bolstering the province's carbon 
pricing structure, a move that may offset some of the need for tax 
increases and repair the province's reputation as a carbonpolluter.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under
 the Specified Gas Emitters Regulation, the province charges major 
emitters of greenhouse gases $15 per tonne, but the program has been 
criticized for not reining in carbon emissions or bringing in 
significant revenues for the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"How many times can you skin the cat?" said Jack Mintz, Palmer Chair, School of Public Policy at the <span class="companylink">University of Calgary</span>.
 "Corporate tax increases, royalty increase and carbon tax are major 
hits, but the crucial one is the carbon one." "We have been supportive 
of moving towards a more effective carbon pricing," said Matt Horne, <span class="companylink">Pembina Institute</span>'s
 associate regional director. "That could be the cap and trade that 
Quebec has adopted and Ontario is moving towards, or the B.C. carbon tax
 model, which is the strongest example to look to."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adopting a carbon-tax 
model may be easier to implement than adjusting the complex royalty 
regime and, in theory, could help the province gain <b>social acceptance</b> for pipelines with the added benefit of meeting the low-carbon fuel standards being implemented by many oil-importing regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The carrot of government 
backing pipelines may entice industry to endure the stick of higher 
carbon taxes. Although most oil and gas producers publicly balk at any 
notion of raising business costs amid a sustained price downturn, many 
companies have privately been working on the assumption that carbon 
levies could reach $40 per tonne - a figure the previous government had 
proposed in 2013, which is estimated to raise oilsands costs by $2 per 
barrel. The NDP platform states that as the government it would "lead on
 climate change" and phase out coal-fired electricity generation to 
reduce smog and greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need to look at all 
the options before us and then have a good, thorough conversation with 
other jurisdictions to talk about how this is all going to work 
together," Notley said this week on the idea of a carbon-tax, noting 
that a capand-trade scheme may not work for Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Changes in the royalty regimes, however, may be inherently more difficult and has the industry more fearful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When there is 
uncertainty in a regulatory regime, there is greater risk that capital 
will either stall or even start to flow out of that regime rather than 
into it," said Janice Buckingham, Calgary-based partner at Osler, Hoskin
 Harcourt LLP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Premier-elect 
Notley believes Alberta has the lowest royalty rates in the world, a 
comparison with other jurisdictions suggests otherwise. Similar to its 
Western Canada counterparts, Alberta's existing royalty regime is 
complex and operates on a sliding scale, sensitive to market prices, 
productivity, age and depth of wells drilled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Notley wants to 
implement a competitive royalty regime that escalates royalties as 
prices rise, "it's fair to say, the province has that," Buckingham 
noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The maximum royalty on 
Alberta's conventional oil is 40 per cent of net revenue, compared to 
British Columbia's 35 per cent; the natural gas upper limits net 35 per 
cent for Alberta and 27 per cent for B.C. For oilsands production, the 
current structure allows for recovery of extensive investment before a 
royalty of 25 per cent to 40 per cent is payable, compared to 37.1 per 
cent for Saskatchewan's mostly heavy oil. Including all taxes and 
royalties, Alberta nets 54 per cent from the oilsands, B.C. 43 per cent 
and Saskatchewan 50.2 per cent, according to School of Public Policy 
data. In Texas the total tax and royalty rate stands at 48.5 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Royalty rates hardly paint a complete picture of a jurisdiction's competitiveness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The important point from
 (the Alberta) industry's perspective is to look at the entirety of the 
economic rent that's charged by government to producers," Buckingham 
said. But Alberta has a unique selling point: Unlike B.C. and 
Saskatchewan, the oilsands offer the world's largest marketable oil 
reserve in the world, third in volume only to state-owned resources in 
Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. Once built, albeit at a higher cost than 
most jurisdictions, oilsands developments promise durable production for
 decades, unlike the easilyexhausted shale plays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To offer a fast-food 
analogy, Alberta might say: 'Yes, you are going to make less per unit 
and we are going to take more, but there is many more units to be made 
here," said Kenneth Green, senior director, natural resource studies at <span class="companylink">The Fraser Institute</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Fraser Institute</span>'s
 annual Global Petroleum Survey ranks Alberta as the 16th most 
business-friendly jurisdiction in the world and Green expects the 
province's ranking to slide in the new survey out by the end of the year
 due to rising uncertainty on the government's policy. Notley has said 
the royalty review will go ahead in this term of her government, though 
the exact timing is uncertain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Other factors need to be
 considered in order to formulate a final conclusion on whether one 
jurisdiction is more viable than the other," said Torran Jolly, a 
Calgarybased tax partner at <span class="companylink">KPMG</span>. "It 
is a hard analysis to do in isolation on one variable such as price, not
 taking away the fact the oilsands is the thirdlargest reserve in the 
world. However, we are challenged in Alberta's (lack of ) access to 
market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, if the government
 is looking to charge a premium for companies to operate in the 
oilsands, the payback to the industry must be vociferous, rather than 
just a lukewarm, backing of pipelines. Instead, the NDP has questioned 
the importance of U.S.-focused Keystone XL pipeline and the Northern <span class="companylink">Gateway</span> conduit to Asia, although has backed the west-to-east <b>Energy</b>
 East project. But the appointment of Brian Topp as chief of staff by 
Notley, may not inspire the industry with confidence given his critical 
view on pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new government's 
efforts to raise revenues through higher corporate taxes could also 
backfire, if companies shift their profits to other lower-tax 
jurisdictions. If the NDP follows through with its pledge to raise 
corporate taxes to 12 per cent from 10 per cent, it would make Alberta a
 higher-tax jurisdiction than B.C., Ontario and Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You don't have to move 
capital, machines and labour to shift profits to other provinces," said 
Mintz, as the companies will start orchestrating financial engineering 
to lower government take. "Some companies are planning to shift profits 
out of Alberta if the rate goes up to 12 per cent."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Ottawa announcing 
Friday a promise to cut carbon emissions by 30 per cent by 2030, Notley 
may be in the sweet spot to drive her ambition to cut carbon emissions. 
"You can't keep piling them on," Pembina's Horne said of new taxes. "A 
carbon tax would result in less corporate tax being collected - and 
ensure Alberta remains competitive."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between the slicked-back 
hair and the poodle skirts, Philemon Wright High School's lively and 
nostalgic production of the classic musical Grease gave the audience a 
memorable blast back to the 1950s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since its first 
performance in 1971 at the Kingston Mines Theater in Chicago, Grease has
 had numerous incarnations - Philemon Wright's production was based in 
particular on the 2007 Broadway revival. In spite of these different 
versions, the same captivating story remains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1959, a wholesome girl
 named Sandy Dumbrowski (Danielle Hebert) moves to Rydell High School 
where she must adapt to the complex politics of the student body, 
dividing her attention between her friends in the Pink Girls clique and 
her sometimes boyfriend Danny Zuko (James Thompson), leader of the 
T-birds greaser gang. Along the way, the characters cope with the 
lighthearted and the more serious aspects of adolescent life in the era.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The show's most defining characteristic was its unwavering, infectious <b>energy</b>, which it accomplished in great part through its complex musical numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With an enormous cast, 
often appearing all at once, the production doubtless demanded elaborate
 planning. Nonetheless, choreographer Sandra Girard kept everybody 
moving together, and all the actors were kept occupied onstage, even 
when they weren't the centre of the action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hebert's strong voice, 
making tactful use of vibrato, distinguished itself throughout her many 
songs in her role as Sandy. Sandy undergoes a radical transformation 
near the end of the work, and Hebert made this transition seamlessly. 
Indeed, Hebert's excellent rendition of You're The One That I Want was, 
between her passionate singing and spirited dancing, the most energetic 
and delightful number of the evening. James Thompson brilliantly 
portrayed the different dimensions of Zuko, showing both his sensitive 
side in talking with Sandy, as well as his rough-and-ready nature while 
on his misadventures with the T-birds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From among the cast of 
almost 50 actors and dancers came a multitude of particularly skilled 
supporting performances. As Betty Rizzo, Avrie Constantine Amey was 
crass and bawdy but also touchingly pensive in her song There Are Worse 
Things I Could Do. A particularly comic performance came from Brendan 
Mailloux, playing the nerdy Eugene. Whether stumbling dramatically after
 being tripped by bullies or uneasily resisting the advances of the 
lascivious jive master Cha-Cha (Alicia Bellavance) at the dance, his 
deliciously awkward movements were among the most hilarious of the 
evening. As the manic Sonny, Christopher Chow's exaggerated swagger and 
slick dance moves, as well as his omnipresent grin, played a significant
 role in establishing the group dynamic of the T-birds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The production's hair and
 makeup team contributed much to the period-correct atmosphere of the 
show, with elaborate hairdos for the girls and oily slicked-back looks 
for the T-birds. The team's chef-d'oeuvre, however, was undoubtedly 
their execution of Sandy's metamorphosis, completely changing her makeup
 and hairstyle in minutes. The show's stage crew, led by Luna De 
Salterain, accomplished the set changes rapidly and discreetly, and the 
lighting was always smooth, managing rapid changes between highlighting 
different groups onstage without incident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With outstanding 
performances from Hebert and Thompson, and equally strong 
interpretations from the supporting cast, Philemon Wright's engrossing 
production of Grease did not lack in talented singing and dancing, but, 
most importantly, was imbued with <b>energy</b> that effortlessly carried the show through its duration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jasmine Stamos</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critic, Sacred Heart High School</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gossip, crushes and 
school dances; all intrinsic aspects of the high school experience. Add 
in some leather jackets, poodle skirts, and a whole lot of hair gel, and
 you have Philemon Wright High School's wildly entertaining and skilful 
portrayal of Grease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Sandy Dumbrowski 
arrives at her new school Rydell High, she is shocked to discover that 
her summer fling Danny Zuko is also in attendance. Here their sweet love
 affair is threatened by high school social politics - as the ringleader
 of the T-Birds, a gang of guys working at the local car shop, his 
fear-engendering status simply cannot afford to be threatened by talks 
of romance. With the aid of the Pink Ladies, an undeniably spunky 
assemblage, Sandy undergoes a path of self-discovery peppered with real 
teen issues ranging from teen pregnancy to failed education. Premiering 
on Broadway in 1972, this classic musical gained popularity with the 
release of the film version starring John Travolta and Olivia 
Newton-John.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The entirety of the musical was staged with stunning confidence and high <b>energy</b>.
 With skilled vocalists, individualized costuming and engaging 
choreography, Philemon Wright's production of Grease was a light-hearted
 exploration of the life and times of the typical 1950s era teen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Thompson as Danny 
Zuko portrayed the popular bad-boy with expertise as he convincingly 
portrayed the turmoil of a teen with a reputation to maintain. Along 
with his captivating vocal performance, he demonstrated remarkable 
emotional range, switching back and forth from a ruffian greaser to a 
lovelorn teen desperate for his girl's approval with ease. As Thompson's
 counterpart, Danielle Hebert portrayed the naive Sandy Dumbrowski with 
aplomb. Her vocal prowess and dexterity was particularly evident in her 
solo number, the heart-tugging love ballad Hopelessly Devoted to You.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The T-Birds were 
humorously raucous and crass, often contrasting with the uber-sassy band
 of Pink Ladies. Particularly noteworthy was Rowen Tanguay, whose 
comedic number Mooning, performed alongside the insatiably hungry Jan 
(Emma Gibson), was refreshing and entertaining as the funny-boy overtly 
confesses his mooning exploits to an incredulous Jan. Equally 
commendable was Adam French, who possessed an undeniable stage presence 
during his number Beauty School Dropout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The set was 
era-appropriate, with an authentic-looking jukebox and a black-and-white
 checkerboard dance floor on the night of the school prom. Small props 
like fake cigarettes emitting smoke greatly enhanced the genuineness of 
the characters. Hair was elaborately styled, and costumes were cohesive 
and reflected the social group of each individual character. Although 
there were some issues with mics cutting out, this issue was largely 
resolved by the second act, and was compensated for by the vitality of 
the performers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a confident, 
enthusiastic cast and strong vocal performances from all, Philemon 
Wright High School's production of Grease was a tremendous homage to the
 toe-tapping, free-living youth of the 1950s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Katie Dolguikh</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lead Critic, Lisgar Collegiate Institute</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long after leaving the 
Philemon Wright High School auditorium, people were still tapping their 
feet and humming the iconic music of the golden '50s enjoyed by the 
students of Rydell High. Greasy cars, greasier hair, and rock-'n-roll 
guide a group of teenagers through the trials and tribulations of young 
love and <b>social acceptance</b> in the fun and energetic journey that is Grease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The production's first of
 many highlights was a gloriously enthusiastic rendition of Greased 
Lightning. The T-Birds and mechanics embraced the accompanying 
choreography, adding flare of their own. They combined dazzling 
acrobatics with simple rhythm, resulting in a number that had the actors
 genuinely enjoying themselves onstage and the audience cheering and 
singing along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With powerful vocals and a
 touching stage presence, Danielle Hebert brought good girl Sandy to 
life. From her first notes in Summer Nights to her lament in Hopelessly 
Devoted to You, Hebert capitalized on her ability to display a wide 
range of emotion while performing vocally. Not to be outdone, James 
Thompson encapsulated bad boy Danny Zuko, employing strong acting chops,
 John Travolta-esque dance moves, and a confident singing voice. A true 
triple threat, Thompson stood out in Hand Jive, keeping up with Cha-Cha 
(Alicia Bellavance) in a complex and demanding dance number. Hebert and 
Thompson had remarkable chemistry, and by the time they were singing, 
You're the One That I Want, the pair had truly become the 1950s 
lovebirds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephanie Milks and 
Louise Mongeon did an impressive job with the hair and makeup, 
establishing the 1950s Rydell High School setting effortlessly by 
engineering each character's specific look. Sandy's transformation from 
good girl to "electrifying" leather-clad rocker was solidified by her 
striking newly teased hair. Though initially struggling to find the 
ideal microphone volume, the sound crew pulled through in the second act
 to favourably highlight the performers' strong vocals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Avrie Constantine Amey 
captured the rebel spirit of Betty Rizzo. Every moment she was on stage,
 Constantine Amey oozed confidence and sass, opening up only during her 
emotional performance of, There Are Worse Things I Could Do. While the 
leads carried the story, Constantine Amey stole the spotlight in every 
scene she led, while still knowing when to step back and let others 
shine. The contrast between her solos in the first and second acts 
indicated her prowess as both an actress and a vocalist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't only major 
characters who made this production a success. Adam Ffrench as Teen 
Angel brought a softness to "Beauty School Dropout"; his silky vocals 
and humble composure charmed both the audience and Frenchy, rendering 
his scene one of the most memorable of the night. Laetitia Kofi gave a 
fun and inspired performance of "Hand Jive", holding her own against the
 crowd of dancers onstage and managing to do some jiving herself, 
despite wearing a gorgeous but restrictive pair of heels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the car it's 
devoted to, this production of Grease was far from systematic and 
automatic. The entire cast shared a love of the stage and of one 
another. The finale reprise of We Go Together added a genuine touch as 
the actors evidently sang to each other directly. The heart and passion 
played by each actor unified the cast and, for those two hours spent at 
Philemon Wright High School, "grease was the time, was the place, was 
the motion" of the night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Megan Sweeney</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critic, Elmwood School</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High school is notorious 
for dramatic romances, envious rivals, and friendships that seem to grow
 with exposure to the real world. Rydell High School falls victim to all
 these ideas, harbouring edgy students who encounter barriers along 
their turbulent journey through their teenage years. With outstanding 
vocal and acting ability, Philemon Wright High School's production of 
Grease stitched a new charm into the good-girl meets bad-boy classic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The script for Grease is 
based upon the experiences of its author, Jim Jacobs, and his adolescent
 life in the late 1950s. Danny Zuko, the handsome, resident gang leader,
 has a passionate summer fling with the virtuous Sandy Dumbrowski. Sandy
 then enrols in Danny's high school for their senior year, offsetting 
his defiant reputation and causing a rift in their relationship. 
Surrounded by a collection of colourful yet often vulgar friends, the 
students of Rydell High struggle to combine their lives and make the 
best of their youth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sandy (Danielle Hebert) 
and Danny (James Thompson) exuded teenage affection with impassioned, 
comedic chemistry. Hebert was an evident vocalist, with an impressive 
range that accompanied the sweet and wholesome demeanour of her innocent
 character. Thompson balanced Sandy's naivety with a masculine rendition
 of Danny, convincingly expressing a tough-guy attitude with a soft spot
 for love.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Avrie Constantine Amey 
played Betty Rizzo, the resilient, sarcastic leader of the Pink Ladies 
clique of Rydell. Amey brilliantly executed the dry wit and unapologetic
 promiscuity of the female gang member, easily transitioning from 
Rizzo's raw persona to the more vulnerable one seen during her pregnancy
 scare. Amey was amicably complemented by the performance of Emma Gibson
 as Jan, the jaunty Pink Lady with a love for food. Gibson embodied the 
goofy character with finesse; her singing and acting talent particularly
 evident in numbers such as Mooning with Jan's love interest, the T-Bird
 gang member Roger (Rowen Tanguay).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The entire ensemble of 
the rugged T-Birds was overall strong in their amusing choral work. The 
enactment of Gabriel Sanchez as Doody was exceptionally striking, as 
Sanchez displayed his guitar skills and musicianship in highlight songs 
such as Those Magic Changes and Rock and Roll Party Queen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supporting the other 
roles with a memorable performance was Brendan Mailloux as Eugene, who 
personified the awkward, nerdy boy with humour and confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The engaging choreography
 was done by Louise Mongeon, Sandra Girard and Phillip Holmes. They 
skilfully structured complicated songs with manageable dancing steps to 
produce dynamic, compelling numbers such as You're The One That I Want.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephanie Milks and 
Louise Mongeon designed the mid-20th century inspired hair and makeup. A
 notable element included the temporary bangs and headscarves seen on 
members of the cast, emphasising the stylish time period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 1958 to 1960 
graduating class of Rydell High School experienced both trials and 
triumphs throughout their senior year, dealing with the process of 
growing up in an unpredictable world. Philemon Wright shaped a superb 
version of Grease, combining staggering vocal power with a chorus <b>energy</b> that installed unique charm into the timeless classic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sarah Priscus</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critic, Mother Teresa High School</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the candy-coloured red
 and green lights rose on the stage of Philemon Wright High School's 
effervescent production of Grease and a recognizable rock-n'-roll tune 
began to play, the audience was transported from a mild mid-April 2015 
night to the bustling beginning of the 1959 school year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Originally a 1971 staple 
stage musical by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey, Grease is perhaps better 
known as the cult favourite 1978 film of the same name starring John 
Travolta and Olivia Newton John. Grease tells the story of the T-Birds 
and the Pink Ladies, working class students at Rydell High. The plot 
concerns Danny Zuko (James Thompson), the self-assured leader of the 
T-Birds, and Sandy Dumbrowski (Danielle Hebert), a sweet, somewhat naive
 girl, who had a summer fling that they believe is over. When school 
begins, however, they meet again as Sandy has transferred to Rydell, and
 the plot follows the misadventures of the senior class. Philemon Wright
 High School's production channelled the recent 2007 Broadway revival by
 reducing some of the raunchy themes but retaining the heart and 
hilarity of the original.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Philemon Wright High 
School's electrifying show featured a consistently charismatic ensemble 
cast, absolutely authentic-feeling friendships, and sparking, sunny 
songs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the over-confident but
 entirely charming Danny Zuko, James Thompson demonstrated an impressive
 range of emotions. Whether he was hiding behind a facade of 
hyper-masculinity or privately revealing his sensitivity in the song 
Sandy, Thompson was a powerful presence onstage. Danielle Hebert 
radiated innocence and gentleness as Sandy Dumbrowski. Her vocal 
abilities were unmatched, with her strong vibrato adding a professional 
quality to her solo songs. Avrie Constantine Amey's performance as Betty
 Rizzo was very strong, and she managed to draw light to the 
self-consciousness behind the character's sarcasm. David MacIntryre 
played Kenickie with conviction and admirable projection, and impressed 
especially in his more aggressive scenes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The greaser T-Birds 
(Gabriel Sanchez, David MacIntryre, Rowen Tanguay, Christopher Chow, and
 James Thompson) and the Pink Ladies (Avrie Constantine Amey, Vanessa 
Geldart, Emma Gibson, and Hannah Cheslock) were important and extremely 
energetic additions to the cast. The Broadway-esque vocals of Rowen 
Tanguay, as Roger were highlighted particularly in the song "Mooning" 
with Emma Gibson as Jan, who herself was a quirky, clownish character. 
Vanessa Geldart as Frenchy was endearingly ditsy with fantastic comic 
timing. Brendan Mailloux as the nerdy Eugene and Jessie Cullen as the 
annoyingly over-enthusiastic Patty Simcox were both hilarious, and 
absolute audience favourites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stable, spirited 
performances onstage were aided by a solid backstage team. The lighting,
 by Alex Guimont, Cedrick Runbold, and Thomas Hamilton, added the 
perfect ambient balance to the production. From swirling lights around 
the audience to warm, dimmed lighting reminiscent of a sunset for 
evening scenes, every scene was lit in time. The stage crew was 
efficient and effective in transforming the stage swiftly to each unique
 setting. Sandra Girard, as the student choreographer of three songs, 
displayed great skill in creating accessible but still immensely 
entertaining dance numbers. The players of Grease, both onstage and 
offstage, worked in-sync to present a colourful, captivating retelling 
of a North American classic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Philemon Wright High 
School's vivacious and vibrant production of Grease demonstrated that 
even through class conflict, violence, and teenage pregnancy scares, 
friendship will always prevail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About the reviews</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The production at 
Philemon Wright High School was reviewed by 30 critics representing 14 
schools. The critic discussions were mentored by teacher Gwen Smid of 
Nepean High School and student reviews were edited and selected for 
publication by teacher Teresa Marquis of Elmwood School, who could see

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the panel did not find any clear links between wind turbines and adverse health effects.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conclusions, released April 9 by the Council of Canadian Academies, builds on other studies, both by the <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span> and by wind <b>energy</b>
 lobby groups in the U.S. and Canada, that generally have found no 
specific adverse health effects from living near wind turbines. A 2009 
study sponsored by the <span class="companylink">American Wind <b>Energy</b> Association</span> and <span class="companylink">Canadian Wind <b>Energy</b> Association</span> also found that noise from wind turbines was annoying but not harmful to human health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The council is an 
independent body that provides expert assessments of scientific matters 
to inform public policy issues in Canada. The 10-member expert panel 
that produced the "Understanding the Evidence: Wind Turbine Noise" 
report was chaired by Tee Guidotti, Fulbright visiting chair at the 
Institute for Science, Society and Policy at the <span class="companylink">University of Ottawa</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The panel looked at what
 had been written on the potential health effects of exposure to wind 
turbines, in the scientific literature, legal cases, and the most 
informative public documents," Guidotti said in a news release. "We 
identified 32 health issues and then analyzed the published peer 
reviewed studies on each problem to determine if there was evidence for a
 causal relationship with wind turbine noise."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The panel's final report
 is an attempt to objectively and rigorously review empirical research 
on the causal link between wind turbine noise and adverse health 
effects, as well as potential solutions to noise-related issues 
contemplated elsewhere, all of which may help in addressing concerns 
about wind turbine noise in Canada," it said in the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the expert panel's 
11 findings was: "The evidence consistently shows a positive 
relationship between outdoor wind turbine noise levels and the 
proportion of people who report high levels of annoyance." A person's 
level of annoyance, however, may be influenced by his or her attitudes 
toward wind turbines. "The current state of the evidence does not allow 
for a definite conclusion about whether annoyance is caused by exposure 
to wind turbine noise alone, or whether factors such as visual impacts 
and personal attitudes modify the noise-annoyance relation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relationships between 
wind turbines and other perceived health effects were less clear. The 
expert panel found "limited" evidence linking wind turbine noise to 
sleep disturbances, but no connection to hearing loss, "even over a 
lifetime of exposure."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel found 
inadequate evidence of a relationship between wind turbine noise and 
stress, though it said other sources of noise could contribute to a 
person's stress level. Evidence linking other specific ailments, such as
 fatigue, tinnitus or diabetes, to wind turbine noise was insufficient 
to draw any connections, in part because specific studies have not been 
done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Installed wind <b>energy</b> capacity in Canada totaled almost 9,700 MW as of the end of 2014, according to <span class="companylink">CanWEA</span>,
 supplying about 4% of the country's electricity demand. More than half 
the installed capacity is in Ontario and Quebec. In the U.S., according 
to AWEA's most recent market report, there were 62,300 MW installed as 
of the end of the 2014 third quarter, with another 13,600 MW under 
construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its findings, the 
panel also recommended some future approaches to research to better 
answer whether noise from wind turbines has any direct effects on human 
health. It suggested further research because it is recognized that 
chronic annoyance and sleep disturbance can contribute to serious 
illnesses such as cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Near-term technological 
solutions are unlikely, the panel concluded, though it acknowledged that
 today's turbines produce lower sound emissions than earlier models.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel also recommended that wind <b>energy</b>
 developers engage host communities very early on to better inform local
 residents and continue that engagement even after turbines are 
installed and operating, "with the goal of fostering <b>social acceptance</b>."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A fledgling B.C. bitumen refinery project makes economic sense even in a world of low oil prices, says a consultant to <span class="companylink">Pacific Future <b>Energy</b></span>.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 Vancouver-based upstart, which wants to refine Alberta oil and ship it 
to Asia, expects the cost of bitumen supplies from the oil sands will be
 sharply lower than the revenue from exporting refined petroleum 
products, said Ron Loborec, Canadian <b>energy</b> leader at <span class="companylink">Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This oil refinery will 
be profitable. Diesel will be the highlight and it is highly sought 
after," he said in an interview after returning from a recent trip to 
Asia with <span class="companylink">Pacific Future <b>Energy</b></span> officials, who are seeking overseas investors to help kick-start the ambitious project to be located near Prince Rupert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for benchmark 
Western Canadian Select heavy oil are lower than those for West Texas 
intermediate light crude, so that provides a further cushion for the 
planned B.C. refinery to have cheaper costs for supplies, Mr. Loborec 
said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plans for the 
$11.4-billion (U.S.) refinery project feature the latest in technology, 
including carbon capture and storage. The result would be low emissions 
in the refining process to produce 216,000 barrels a day of petroleum 
products such as diesel, gasoline, propane and jet fuel. Most of the 
output would be exported to customers in Asia. <span class="companylink">Pacific Future <b>Energy</b></span>
 wants to take advantage of the price spread between heavy oil and 
refined products, believing it can operate efficiently amid either high 
or low oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Loborec joined two of <span class="companylink">Pacific Future <b>Energy</b></span>'s leaders, Stockwell Day and Robert Delamar, on the Asian tour earlier this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Day, a former federal international trade minister, is <span class="companylink">Pacific Future <b>Energy</b></span>'s senior adviser, while Mr. Delamar serves as the company's chief executive officer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Pacific Future <b>Energy</b></span> is studying transporting crude by rail to Prince Rupert, though a pipeline is possible if conditions change to allow <span class="companylink">Enbridge Inc</span>. or <span class="companylink">TransCanada Corp</span>. to build a line from Alberta to northwestern B.C., Mr. Loborec said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a 16-page slide presentation during the overseas trip, <span class="companylink">Pacific Future <b>Energy</b></span>
 devoted three pages to the hurdles faced by Enbridge's controversial 
Northern Gateway heavy oil pipeline proposal. “Why opposition to 
Enbridge: Lack of social licence," said the headline on one slide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northern Gateway's plan 
calls for loading unrefined heavy oil into tankers for export from 
Kitimat, raising worries about spills into Douglas Channel and the 
Pacific Ocean. By contrast, any spill of refined petroleum products 
would result in “significantly less environmental damage," according to 
the slide presentation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Northern Gateway has encountered difficulties in gaining <b>social acceptance</b>, the Enbridge-owned project has taken steps to address concerns from environmentalists and First Nations, Mr. Day said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Northern Gateway has run into challenges, but I also give it credit for making progress," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northern Gateway has been
 striving to improve its relationships with First Nations and Métis 
groups in British Columbia. “Building more long-term, meaningful 
partnerships with these communities is our top priority right now. 
Northern Gateway will continue to listen, collaborate and build trust to
 ensure that aboriginal input and traditional knowledge is incorporated 
into the project," Northern Gateway spokesman Ivan Giesbrecht said in a 
statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Pacific Future <b>Energy</b></span>
 spokesman Mark Marissen said the refinery venture is in its early 
stages and it could take until 2023 for production to begin, assuming 
investors and commodity buyers are eventually secured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Samer Salameh, the chairman of Pacific Future <b>Energy</b>,
 manages telecom and business development for Grupo Salinas, a Mexican 
conglomerate. “Our refinery will be built close to the water. Huge ships
 will deliver prefabricated modules and we will assemble them onshore. 
It will be like a huge Lego set," Mr. Salameh said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newspaper publisher David Black's rival Kitimat Clean oil refinery project has targeted its opening for 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry analysts have 
expressed skepticism about the plans for Prince Rupert and Kitimat, 
cautioning that turning refinery dreams into reality won't be easy 
because tens of millions of dollars must be spent over a three-year 
engineering period before entering the multibilliondollar construction 
stage lasting four or five years.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Innergex spokesman 
Francois Morin said Thursday the firm is no longer looking at situating 
wind turbines within a 15-kilometre radius of Jack Garland Airport based
 on feedback by radar operator <span class="companylink">NAV Canada</span>, which has indicated the original proposal would interfere with equipment.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morin
 said the city was informed during a meeting Wednesday and that there 
will be ongoing dialogue as the company continues to evaluate and 
develop the proposal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a very good 
meeting," said Morin, noting additional changes are likely to occur 
through further consultation with the city and other stakeholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course the city has to protect its investment. It has a legitimate concern about the airport."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Innergex's original wind farm proposal included turbines on Crown land about eight kilometres northeast of the airport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Nav Canada, the city 
and local pilots raised safety concerns about potential interference 
with equipment and flight paths. The city also indicated the proposal 
could hamper efforts to attract companies to its airport industrial 
business park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morin said the proposal, 
which is still in early development, now involves turbines a little more
 than 15 kilometres from the airport -outside Nav Canada's and the 
airport's area of concern. He said the exact scope of the project has 
not yet been determined, although it would be a maximum 150 megawatts 
-approximately 50 turbines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the size depends on capacity to connect to the grid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Al McDonald said 
the city was pleased to hear of the change, alleviating its operational 
and economic development concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a very 
constructive first meeting," said McDonald, noting the city has some 
outstanding concerns about the possible location of the turbines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, he said, the city wants to ensure <span class="companylink">Atlantic Power Corporation</span>'s local operation is protected. The company generates electricity from hot exhaust gases discharged by <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s natural gas pipe-line. McDonald said there may also be other local groups with objections to the wind farm proposal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morin said Innergex is 
considering including the Merrick project, as well as a separate wind 
farm proposal in the Mattawa area, as part of a provincial bidding 
process that's expected to open Sept. 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the province will issue a request for proposals for projects totalling 300 megawatts of wind and 140 megawatts of solar <b>energy</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the company has not yet decided if it will move ahead with either project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Social acceptance</b> 
is absolutely essential to a project," said Morin, noting the company 
will opt out if it cannot obtain a critical mass of support through 
compromise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that does not mean unanimity, he said, acknowledging the company may not be able to satisfy every concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morin said Innergex will 
reach out over the next several weeks to stakeholders in the North Bay 
area regarding the Merrick proposal, including cottagers, hunters and 
other land users, before hosting larger meetings for the general public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the company made a
 mistake in the Mattawa area by bringing the proposal forward to the 
general public without first consulting with stakeholder groups. Had it 
done so, Morin said the company likely could have alleviated some 
concerns earlier on and provided more definitive answers about the 
proposal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said it's clear there 
is no public acceptance for the Mattawa area proposal at this time. And 
Morin said Innergex and its partner will have to make a decision down 
the road if the project will proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's better to lose a 
good project than to win a bad one," he said, noting Innergex has never 
sold any of its assets and looks to be a longtime operator and community
 partner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Innergex has teamed up 
with the Algonquins of Pikwakanagan First Nation of Ottawa region to 
pursue the proposed 150-megawatt project west of Mattawa and north of 
the Mattawa River. The project, however, has so far faced strong 
opposition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Morin said 
consultation and mitigation is part of the process. He said the company 
is willing to make changes based on concerns that arise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the project were to 
move ahead and receive provincial approval, Morin said it wouldn't be 
until 2019 that the turbines are in operation due to a lengthy 
environmental assessment process.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A majority of Canadians 
says Canada’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gases have been dismal and 
they want the federal government to take the lead in creating tax 
policies for curbing emissions, a new poll suggests.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But
 a much smaller number of participants in the survey done for The Globe 
and Mail and released on Wednesday by Nanos Research said they want to 
see those taxes reflected at the gas pumps or on home heating bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The poll comes as federal parties pitch their plans for <b>energy</b>
 production and carbon reduction in the runup to a fall election, and 
federal and provincial governments work to submit a post-2020 GHG 
strategy to the United Nations ahead of the Paris summit in December, 
where global governments hope to conclude a climate treaty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey was conducted 
the week that U.S. President Barack Obama vetoed legislation that would 
have allowed for construction of the Keystone XL pipeline that would 
carry oil sands bitumen from Alberta to Texas refineries. Critics say 
the pipeline would contribute to global warming, a conclusion that a 
State Department review rejected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked to assess 
Canada’s efforts to cut the output of the greenhouse gases that 
contribute to global warming, just 14 per cent of respondents rated them
 to be “good” or “very good.” That compared with the 29 per cent who 
described the country’s performance as “poor” and another 28 per cent 
who said it was “very poor.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What this shows is that 
there is a general recognition in the Canadian populace that we are 
laggards when it comes to reducing greenhouse gas,” said Nik Nanos, the 
president of the polling company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Environment Canada</span>
 says that without new action the country will fall short by a wide 
margin on the Harper government’s pledge to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions by 17 per cent from 2005 levels by 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Bennett, the 
executive director of Sierra Club Canada, said he is pleased at the 
level of understanding the survey respondents demonstrated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Their assessment of 
Canada’s actions on climate change is absolutely correct,” Mr. Bennett 
said. “And I think if there was a federal politician who wanted to show 
some leadership, there is something to be gained here.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the survey also suggests most Canadians are unwilling to pay more in carbon taxes that put a price on pollution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While 71 per cent said 
they “support” or “somewhat support” imposing new taxes on businesses 
that emit greenhouse gases, just 41 per cent were willing to consider 
new taxes on gasoline, and only 37 per cent supported hiking taxes on 
home heating oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“On the one hand,” Mr. 
Nanos said, Canadians “want to reduce greenhouse gases, and on the other
 hand, they want someone else to pay for it, to bear the brunt.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nanos, who is a global fellow in <b>energy</b> policy at the <span class="companylink">Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars</span> in Washington, D.C., will speak this week at a Positive <b>Energy</b> conference at the <span class="companylink">University of Ottawa</span> that will look at ways to garner <b>social acceptance</b> of <b>energy</b> development in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His company recruited 
1,000 random Canadians by landline and cellular telephone to complete 
the survey online between Feb. 22 and 27. A poll of this size is 
expected to reflect the views of the general population accurately 
within 3.1 percentage points 19 times in 20.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Support for increasing 
taxes on gas and home-heating fuels was slightly higher in British 
Columbia than it was in other parts of the country. British Columbia has
 its own carbon tax, as has Alberta to a lesser extent. Quebec has a 
cap-and-trade market, and Ontario is promising to introduce a 
climate-change strategy this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But “three out of every 
four Canadians gave a tip of the hat to the federal government to take 
the lead on policies for taxes on fossil fuels,” Mr. Nanos said. “Part 
of this probably has to do with the view that Canadians don’t want to 
see a patchwork tax policy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With so many Canadians 
saying Canada is failing on greenhouse gas reduction, it is perhaps not 
surprising that Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in December that he 
is looking at the price Alberta has put on carbon as a possible model 
for the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conservative government has, so far, refused to regulate emissions from the oil and gas industries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liberal Leader Justin 
Trudeau told The Globe and Mail he believes Canadians understand it is 
necessary to put on price on carbon. “And not in a moral sense that it’s
 good for the environment – although, yes, that’s there – but in an 
economic sense, because we can’t get our resources to market, we can’t 
get trading partners to look at us kindly.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And NDP Leader Thomas 
Mulcair told The Globe: “We have to make polluters pay for the pollution
 they create and that includes carbon pollution. So putting a price on 
carbon is not something the NDP is going to just talk about, we’re going
 to do it because we know it’s the only way to start reducing greenhouse
 gas emissions in our country and come to grips with the real global 
challenge that is global warming.”</p>

selected for their intrigue factor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it's all free and open to everyone. The only entrance requirement is curiosity and a willingness to engage with new ideas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other institutions 
frequently offer events like science fairs. But IdeaFest is unique in 
showing off the wide breadth of research happening at UVic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The <span class="companylink">University of Victoria</span> is a medium-sized university, but we have an enormous research portfolio," Castle said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The research portfolio 
covers everything from neuroscience through to work in the fine arts, 
theatre and everything in between."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IdeaFest also offers 
chances to do hands-on workshops. An exploration of anthropology, for 
example, on Saturday, March 7, offers an afternoon of activities from 
bone identification to investigating and even replicating an ancient 
cave painting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least 10 of the events
 have even been selected with kids in mind. The culture of the orcas 
living around Vancouver Island, for example, was selected for its appeal
 to young people. But given the wide interest in whales, however, 
adults, are also expected and will be welcomed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All presentations come 
from UVic's own researchers, from world-renowned experts in their fields
 to resident professors to undergraduate students.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And all of them have been selected for their likelihood to engage, interest or even enchant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the orca, to the working of the human brain, or to <b>energy</b> systems, organizers like to think there is something for everyone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IdeaFest is also a chance
 for the university to "open its doors" to the community and allow its 
neighbours inside to get a look at what's going on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's an opportunity for 
us to showcase all the research that goes on here and all the fantastic 
researchers themselves," said Castle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are "actually really
 focused on taking their research out of the university and making it 
accessible to the public," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Castle, whose own 
academic background is in biotechnology, said researchers, from arts to 
science, tend to use jargon, or technical words, to describe their 
activities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are always going 
to be people who understand what they are doing mostly in terms of the 
technical language they use in their field," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But some of our 
researchers are born communicators, and this is actually something they 
relish doing," Castle said. "They are really enthusiastic."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"And one of the things we
 have achieved of the years of running IdeaFest is that we have got our 
research community better attuned to making their work accessible," he 
said. rwatts@timescolonist.com</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HISTORY, MEET SCIENCE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First Nations oral 
history will meet 21st-century science when storytellers and academics 
gather to discuss tsunamis and our responses to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ocean Networks Canada 
will bring together a panel of three "knowledge-keepers" from the 
Nuu-chah-nulth peoples from the west coast of Vancouver Island, an 
oceanographer and an official from Emergency Management B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The idea is really about
 taking these different ways of knowing and looking to see how we can 
get the best from both so we can be better prepared on our coast," said 
Maia Hoeberechts, an associate director at Ocean Networks Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, Hoeberechts 
said, a major tsunami struck the west coast of Vancouver Island, wiping 
out several First Nations communities in 1700. It was far bigger even 
than the 1964 tsunami that caused widespread damage in Port Alberni.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nuu-chah-nulth people
 still speak of the 1700 event. Meanwhile, scientists co-ordinating the 
Vancouver Island First Nations stories with Japanese written records 
have nailed the event down to Jan. 26, 1700.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hoeberechts said the 1700
 event was generated by a quake whose epicentre was very close to 
Vancouver Island's west coast. By contrast, the 1964 event that struck 
Port Alberni was generated by a quake near Alaska.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the 1700 tsunami wave 
hit Vancouver Island very quickly after the seismic jolt on the ocean 
floor. Unlike 1964, there was no wide distance of ocean to absorb much 
of the <b>energy</b> from the event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The impact of it would have been huge," said Hoeberechts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nuu-chah-nulth 
place-based stories and tsunami science will be on Thursday, March 5, 3 
p.m. to 5 p.m. at the ceremonial hall of the First People's House.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOPHISTICATED CAVEMEN</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to art, the cavemen of 40,000 years ago were often more sophisticated than modern university students.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">University of Victoria Prof</span>.
 April Nowell, in the department of anthropology, said she often starts 
one course with a week-long session where students are required to 
reproduce images created 40,000 years ago on the sides of a cave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nowell said almost always, students finish the week with new respect for the talent and observations of early humans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The students will say 'I
 can't believe how complex their images are,'" she said. "'One little 
curve here gives volume, some shading there gives roundness and three 
dimensions that my image just lacks.' "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Teaching ancient, 
cave-art methods will be one of the sessions in Hands-on Anthropology. 
Participants can check out ancient bone casts and also try to imagine 
how our ancestors lived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So another part of 
Hands-on Anthropology will invite participants to create musical 
instruments used by the North and South Americans prior to the arrival 
of Christopher Columbus in 1492.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Giving people a chance to
 examine the art, the culture and the music of ancient peoples will give
 participants a richer appreciation of ancient peoples and their world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their lives were likely much more than just savage struggles for survival. These were real people living the human experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When we start to put in the art and the music it gives such a richer understanding of our past," said Nowell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hands-on Anthropology is 
on Saturday, March 7 in Cornett Building, noon to 3:30 p.m. Room B225, 
noon -3:30 p.m. hosts cave painting. Room B222, noon to 3:30 p.m. hosts 
bone identification. Room B250, noon to 2 p.m. is pre-Columbian 
instrument-making.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEYOND 'GAMERGATE'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">University philosopher 
and longtime computer gamer Audrey Yap was never surprised by the sexism
 and anti-woman motifs in video games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Yap said she was a 
little taken aback by the online viciousness of the backlash when some 
women gamers suggested the anti-women elements were unpleasant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You see a few women speaking up saying: 'Hey, isn't diversity a good thing?' or 'Hey, it looks there is some sexism in here.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"And the reaction is just
 massive, so surprisingly out of proportion," said Yap, an associate 
professor of philosophy specializing in logic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Gamergate" erupted last 
August when women in the video-game industry who criticized the sexism 
and violent anti-woman attitudes in some video games sparked a massive 
online uproar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The controversy grew in its viciousness when some feminist thinkers spoke up about the sexism in some video games. <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> campaigns threatening harm, rape and even death broke out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Part of what makes this 
so interesting is: 'Why the reaction?'" Yap said. "Why is the reaction 
so extreme?" She said "nerd culture," video gaming and the whole digital
 world has grown in <b>social acceptance</b>. "Geeks" are now part of the mainstream, widely accepted and no longer seen as the victims of bullies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yap speculated the viciousness of the response to criticisms of the video games is driven by an inner defensiveness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Clearly, if these people really feel this way, it has got to have something to do with how they see themselves," Yap said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Women tech-culture: 
What's the big deal about diversity anyway? will be on Monday, March 2, 5
 p.m.-6:30 p.m. in the Engineering/Computer Science Building, Room 660.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHITHER ISLAMIC STATE?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Academics will boldly step in where most specialists fear to tread, the Middle East, to discuss the new phenomenon of ISIS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IdeaFest will bring 
together a broad panel of experts, historians, political scientists and 
religious experts to examine ISIS, the <span class="companylink">Islamic State in Iraq and Syria</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martin Bunton, associate 
professor of history (Middle East) and the acting director of UVic's 
Centre for Global Studies, said ISIS can be examined on many different 
levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is it just another 
militia group stepping in to fill the political void left behind after 
the collapse of Iraq, after the 2003 U.S. invasion and the recent 
implosion of Syria?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is it so successful? 
Does its success have anything to do with its extreme violence? 
Recently, it outraged people around the world by burning a Jordanian 
pilot alive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What are the religious 
elements of ISIS? It claims to be ready to create an Islamic state. But 
fellow Muslims in places such as Iran are nowhere near supportive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if anybody does 
battle with ISIS, will that be taken as giving aid to Syrian regime of 
Bashar al-Assad? Al-Assad, after all, is somebody many leaders wish 
would disappear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bunton said his wife once
 told him about eating an oyster-like piece of seafood in Japan that 
seemed to grow bigger the more she chewed. It was a perfect metaphor for
 the Middle East.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The more you examine the Middle East looking for answers, the more questions appear to emerge," Bunton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Canada has put itself into the middle of that," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's War on ISIS will be discussed on Thursday, March 5, 5:30 p.m.-7:30 p.m. at the David Turpin Building Room A102.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SECRETS OF ISLAND ORCAS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world of the orca is very multicultural.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists have learned 
these complicated animals organize themselves into various groups that 
eat, hunt, live and even speak differently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UVic marine biologist 
Kristen Kanes, who will lead a discussion called Orcas of Vancouver 
Island, said researchers now segregate the animals into three 
"ecotypes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One ecotype are 
residents. These are orcas that live in groups, eat fish, mostly salmon,
 and tend to stay within a specific area. These local residents are 
segregated into two groups, north and south of Campbell River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another groups are the 
Bigg's orcas, formerly known as transients. These animals live alone or 
in small groups and attack and eat marine mammals, such as dolphins, 
seals and sea lions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kane, who is using ocean 
acoustics to complete her studies, said the residents and Bigg's orcas 
even speak or vocalize quite differently. It's almost as if they speak 
different languages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When they meet, it has 
been suggested, residents and Biggs recognize each other from their 
different sounds. And they can even fight over their differences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The residents and the Bigg's orcas have a long history of not liking each other," Kane said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third group spotted around Vancouver Island, but only occasionally, are the offshore orcas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These animals live in 
large groups, about 100 or even more, and live far out to sea. But 
occasionally they have been known to stray into the Strait of Juan de 
Fuca.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They are very mysterious and we don't know a whole lot about them," Kane said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orcas of Vancouver Island will be held Friday, March 6, 3 p.m. -5 p.m., Room 062 in the Elliott Building.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In
 a report released late in 2014, Quebec’s environmental review board has
 concluded that the risks and liabilities posed by shale gas development
 outweigh the potential benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following public hearings
 in Quebec earlier last year, the BAPE (Bureau d'audiences publiques sur
 l'environnement) issued a 600-page report on shale gas in December 
2014, but released an English version of key sections only recently.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just
 days after the study came out, Quebec business groups warned Premier 
Philippe Couillard against closing the door on shale development, should
 he accept the BAPE’s conclusions (DOB, Dec. 18, 2014). Created under a 
provincial law and reporting to Quebec’s minister of sustainable 
development and environment, the board is advisory only, with no mandate
 to decide on projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its report, the board 
focused on the adverse effects often said to accompany shale gas 
development, including “degradation of air quality, increased noise, 
traffic and light pollution,” as well as lower property values in areas 
affected by development. The report also cited the risk of 
“technological accidents,” social impacts, effects on human health and 
surface and groundwater effects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Acknowledging Quebec 
might see gains through the royalties and tax revenue generated by shale
 gas development, the board nonetheless concluded those benefits “would 
be insufficient to compensate for the social and environmental costs and
 externalities, or even to ensure financial viability for the industry.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Even if [natural gas] 
prices were to increase sufficiently to permit viability [of the 
industry] in coming years, there is no evidence to show that the 
financial benefits … would be great enough to compensate for the short- 
and long-term social and environmental costs…,” the board said in a 
summary of its conclusions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the short and medium 
term, the board said the main natural gas supply issue facing Quebec is 
not North American production capacity, but access to pipelines to move 
gas into the province. Moreover, the board said <b>social acceptance</b>
 of shale gas exploration — something the government, hearing 
participants and gas producers consider essential — is “far from being 
acquired,” in the words of board staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among other points, the 
board focused on a key factor differentiating proposed shale gas 
development in the St. Lawrence Lowlands from similar development 
elsewhere in North America, namely, that the lowlands are densely 
populated, while most other shale gas development locations are not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Given the scope of the 
potential impacts associated with shale gas activities in an … area such
 as the [lowlands], and given the uncertainty surrounding potential 
impacts on aquifer water quality …, the inquiry commission believes it 
has not been demonstrated that shale gas exploration and extraction in 
the [lowlands], using the hydraulic fracturing technique, would be 
beneficial to Quebec.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the BAPE’s report 
was delivered to the Liberal government of Premier Couillard, the issue 
was originally referred to the BAPE in early 2013 by the government of 
then-Premier Pauline Marois, whose government later fell (DOB, April 17,
 2013). The Marois government was popularly believed to be 
anti-development, while the Couillard government was considered more 
business-friendly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among groups that warned 
Couillard in December against closing the door on shale development was 
the Quebec Oil and Gas Association (QOGA), which has repeatedly made the
 case for shale gas development in the province. Among other benefits 
shale gas could bring are the many jobs the industry would generate in 
Quebec, QOGA said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The creation of a new 
gas industry in Quebec will significantly contribute to the economic 
wealth of the province, [creating] a specialized, qualified work force, 
strengthening Quebec’s competitiveness, and ensuring sustainable 
development in all of the province’s regions.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In separate news, Quebec’s largest local gas distributor has signalled agreement with comments made by the province’s <b>energy</b>
 regulator on the topic of gas supply and the challenges associated with
 bringing in sufficient gas to meet Quebec’s future needs. In a press 
release Wednesday, Gaz Métro endorsed most of the conclusions Quebec’s 
Régie de l'énergie offered in a statement issued the same day (DOB, Jan.
 8, 2015).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement that 
accords with the views of Ontario and Quebec local gas distributors, 
according to Gaz Métro, the Régie forecast moderate future growth in 
Quebec’s gas consumption, along with sufficient supply availability, but
 highlighted a different issue: the availability of transportation 
infrastructure needed to move gas from production sites to consumption 
markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Régie was also of the
 view that the North Bay-Ottawa section is being used to full capacity 
during peak periods, that the capacity that would be removed by the <span class="companylink"><b>Energy</b> East</span> project must be replaced, and that a more thorough needs assessment must be carried out by project proponent <span class="companylink">TransCanada Corporation</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For its part, Gaz Métro 
said it is not opposed to the conversion of under-used gas pipelines to 
oil service, but cautioned that, for the North Bay-Ottawa section of the
 pipeline, <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> “must ensure that the replacement capacity is sufficient to meet the needs of gas consumers.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s cold in Canada, 
isn’t it?” is the universal conversation opener. Responding to the 
stereotype becomes annoying after countless meetings abroad, but I don’t
 mind when put in a global context. At least I don’t have to answer to 
questions about civil war, corruption, political instability or other 
domestic nastiness that is so prevalent in other countries. People see 
us as a very safe place with a lot of integrity. Yet from a business 
point of view, those who sit on the other side of the table view Canada 
as an unknown expanse. They always want to know about Canada in the 
context of the United States – a free-market point of reference they 
understand.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What does the Alberta oil industry need to do to sustain its appeal to investors?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The universal language of
 investors centres on competitiveness and returns. To attract and retain
 capital, Canada’s oil and gas industry has to be able to deliver 
returns on investment that are as good or better than other 
jurisdictions on a risk-adjusted basis. It’s a simple calculus, but 
complex to achieve. Our biggest risk factor is potentially escalating 
costs; not only the cost of labour and services, but also regulatory 
compliance and <b>social acceptance</b>. Half a dozen years ago, we had 
to compete for capital with places like Russia, West Africa and South 
America. That was easy. Now, we have to compete with the United States, 
which is a lot tougher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta oil has been 
getting a lot of criticism on the environmental front. Does this hurt 
Alberta’s image or reputation as an appealing place to invest?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, the barrage of 
environmental criticism from abroad and from within has hurt Alberta’s 
appeal in the eyes of those who don’t know much about us. However, it 
hasn’t deterred those who are knowledgeable about our stringent 
regulations and other appealing qualities, especially when it comes to 
investing in oil and gas outside the oil-sands sector. The inflow of 
investment capital to non-oil-sands opportunities – a record $25-billion
 of debt and equity this year – would suggest the appeal of our 
jurisdiction has outweighed the criticism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> says that oil could fall as low as $43 a barrel. What’s your prediction?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are many bears out 
there calling for doom and gloom oil prices in the near term. I can’t 
add a lot of value to predicting “heat of the moment” trading. Do I 
think the price of oil can go to $40 a barrel or less? Sure. But to me, 
to sophisticated investors, and to Canadians, the more important thought
 experiment is asking what the outlook is for the longer term. Anything 
less than $80 a barrel is unsustainable. And if the price stays less 
than $60 for any length of time, the price is going a lot higher than 
$80 in a few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What did the most to sink the price of oil? The shale boom in the U.S. or <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> refusing to cut production? And did anyone see this coming?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I say to people that it’s simplistic to think that any one factor – lack of <span class="companylink">OPEC</span>
 restraint, resumption of Libyan production, U.S. tight oil growth, a 
drop in Chinese demand or Canadian oil-sands expansion for that matter –
 torpedoed the price of oil this fall. There were many analysts that 
highlighted the risks of all these things individually, but it’s folly 
to think anyone could have predicted the convergence and timing of all 
the issues to create the current circumstance. There are many moving 
parts in the global oil economy, many more than even a few years ago. 
That’s why the timing of the recovery of oil prices is going to surprise
 many. And it’s going to cause people to ask, “Did anyone see this 
coming?”</p>

 no to the exploration and exploitation of shale gas in Quebec, without 
knowing the actual economic impacts this development could generate, is a
 premature decision that will close the door to a major development 
opportunity, at a time when we need such initiatives to support our 
economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Tuesday, Premier 
Philippe Couillard declared that the government was not going to develop
 a Quebec shale gas industry based on the findings provided in the 
report of the Bureau d'audiences publiques en environnement. But there 
is an enormous gap between the reading of a report and the conclusions 
the government has drawn, thereby depriving all Quebec of the structural
 projects that could contribute to our economic recovery and to putting 
public finances in order, at a time when we need that most.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It
 is fundamental to note that the BAPE does not have the expertise 
required to make a reliable, in-depth economic assessment that can 
inform the government's decisions and that, to date, in Quebec, we do 
not have a cost-benefits analysis based on actual operating scenarios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We understand that the 
public has experienced this issue, which got off to a very poor start, 
as a social ill. That is yet another reason why the government should 
quickly establish a clear, stable and foreseeable legislative and 
regulatory framework in order to redefine its method for working with 
the proponents of major development projects and reassure the public. An
 orderly process that oversees corporations in a structured and strict 
manner is required to ensure that the <b>social acceptance</b> needed 
for these large-scale projects is achieved. At present, the public has a
 partial and incomplete portrait of the situation, as a result of the 
fact that the economic impacts have been completely eliminated from the 
discussion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In order to determine the
 actual development potential, the actual availability of this resource,
 and obtain scientific data that can either confirm or overturn the 
calculations and the conclusions of the current theoretical studies, the
 government should authorize a few pilot projects in Quebec. These 
mini-operating projects would serve to develop in-depth knowledge of the
 potential impact of hydro-fracking and the scientific results would all
 be submitted to a rigorous review by peers, as well as by the industry 
and the environmental groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is also necessary to 
conduct an in-depth study of the royalties, the number of jobs created 
and the economic impacts generated in other provinces and in other 
countries so that the government can estimate the level of wealth to be 
created, wealth which it is depriving itself of by delaying the complete
 examination of this industry. Let us mention the natural gas operating 
models in British Columbia, Alberta and the United States, as well as 
the recent openness of the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> for exploration, particularly in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Poland and Romania. If the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> has given the green light to the development of shale gas, why should Quebec do otherwise?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government does not 
have the means to ignore this development opportunity, at a time when it
 is leaving no stone unturned to take the measures needed to allow it to
 regain its capacity to take action. We ask the government to take the 
required step back and assume its responsibilities in order to make a 
truly informed decision.</p>

 setback to companies that want to use hydraulic fracturing techniques 
to develop shale gas deposits, saying the economic benefits would not 
outweigh the environmental costs. The Globe's Shawn McCarthy writes the 
advisory office of environmental hearings (BAPE in French) reviewed 
plans to develop the Utica shale formation, which proponents say could 
yield an important source of fuel for the Quebec economy and export

the magnitude of the potential costs and externalities, compared to 
royalties that would be collected by Quebec," BAPE said in a release. 
With today's low North American prices, gas explorers face a high 
commercial hurdle, given there is no drilling infrastructure in the 
province. "We agree with [BAPE's] point that <b>social acceptance</b> 
[for fracking] is not there and that public confidence must be built," 
said Michael Binnion, chief executive officer at Questerre <b>Energy</b>. However, he said BAPE is not the best judge of economic benefits that would accrue to the province.</p>

French) reviewed plans to develop the Utica shale formation, which 
proponents say could yield an important source of fuel for the Quebec 
economy and export markets. Its conclusions, delivered Monday, amount to
 a flashing yellow light for industry and the government of Liberal 
Premier Philippe Couillard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commission found that
 exploration and production of shale gas in the St. Lawrence Lowlands 
“would not be advantageous for Quebec because of the magnitude of the 
potential costs and externalities, compared to royalties that would be 
collected by Quebec," BAPE said in a release. “Other concerns also 
remain, including plans of social acceptability, legislation and a lack 
of of knowledge, particularly with respect to water resources."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It added that industry 
and government must work to restore public trust in order to gain 
widespread acceptance of the controversial practice known as fracking, 
which blasts chemically laced water under high pressure to split the 
hydrocarbon-bearing rock in order to extract natural gas or oil. 
Opponents worry about aquifer contamination from poorly constructed oil 
and gas wells, pollution of lakes and rivers from toxic waste water and 
even industrial truck traffic in rural communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fracking has essentially 
been banned in places such as New York State and Nova Scotia, but has 
yielded massive new gas and oil supplies in Pennsylvania, Ohio and in 
the western states and provinces. Quebec is conducting a review of the 
entire oil and gas sector in the province, with a view to tabling 
hydrocarbon legislation by the end of next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province also insists
 that it is essential to have secure supplies of natural gas – in part 
to combat climate change. It has raised concerns about the proposed <span class="companylink"><b>Energy</b> East</span> pipeline, saying it would leave Quebeckers short of gas because <span class="companylink">TransCanada Corp</span>. would take some natural gas pipeline capacity out of commission and use it to ship oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several exploration 
companies have acreage in Quebec but have been unable to drill in order 
to determine whether gas from the Utica field can be profitably 
extracted. With today's low North American prices, the firms face a high
 commercial hurdle, given there is no drilling infrastructure in the 
province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We agree with [BAPE's] point that <b>social acceptance</b> [for fracking] is not there and that public confidence must be built," said Michael Binnion, chief executive at Calgary-based <span class="companylink">Questerre <b>Energy</b> Corp</span>. “And we agree that we need a new hydrocarbon law."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said industry has to 
work with government to reassure the public that the industry will be 
properly regulated. However, he said the environmental bureau is not the
 best judge of economic benefits that would accrue to the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Quebec is sitting on one
 of the biggest gas discoveries in North America, and it is close to the
 biggest markets," he said. “This could be a significant benefit for the
 province."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, one expert said the industry faces an uphill battle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a question of <b>social acceptance</b>.
 That's the only problem in fact," said Germain Belzile, a fulltime

and northern Ontario as well. After the next round of assessments, 
Twolan said no one knows if the community will still be a candidate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A year from now we could be out of this process," he said. "The northern communities are definitely further ahead than we are."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Joint Review Panel 
has until May to make a decision on the OPG DGR, and that outcome will 
no doubt have an impact on this project, Twolan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For some people it'd be comforting to see if they get a construction license," he said, adding the <b>social acceptance</b> in the area surround the Bruce nuclear site remains a benefit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though he doesn't have an
 idea where such a used fuel site would be positioned in Huron-Kinloss, 
"it won't be west of Highway 21" or in close proximity to Lake Huron, he
 said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With the potential grown
 over the next 20 years in that area, we'd never what to sterilize any 
development that could happen down the road," said Twolan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With significant 
agricultural land available, it would be up to landowners to discuss the
 sale of their land for such a project, as well as with the community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NWMO's release said preliminary findings do not confirm technical suitability and safety of any site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At this early point in the process no community is asked to confirm its willingness to host the project," the release said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings do not affect work ongoing in 11 other Ontario and Saskatchewan communities involved in the site selection process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, Arran-Elderslie and Saugeen Shores were eliminated from the process due to the geology and geography in the areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of the communities in
 Bruce County that took part in the project to take will receive 
$400,000, as the "NWMO is recognizing the significant contributions of 
all five Bruce County communities that have participated in the 
process," by contributing to a 'Community Well-Being Fund'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preliminary Assessments are the third of a nine-step process for evaluating suitable communities for a used fuel repository.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The next phase of work 
involves more intensive community learning and engagement," the release 
said. "Work will take on a broader focus to include First Nation and 
Métis communities in the area as well as neighbouring municipalities."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preliminary fieldwork 
will also begin, including geological surveys, and at later date, 
limited borehole drilling, to further assess geology and site 
suitability against technical safety requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As individual studies 
are completed, the NWMO will continue to narrow its focus to areas with 
strong potential to be suitable for hosting a repository," the release 
continues. "Ultimately, the project will only proceed at a site that can
 safely contain and isolate used nuclear fuel and with the involvement 
of the interested community, First Nation and Métis communities in the 
area and surrounding municipalities working together to implement it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project has been a 
multi-year process and is expected to take several more years before a 
preferred site is found and an "informed and willing host" is 
established.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta Premier Jim Prentice is visiting Quebec and Toronto this week to try to sell the <span class="companylink"><b>Energy</b> East</span> pipeline to his counterparts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like a Lincoln Town Car 
salesman who has just noticed that people are hanging out at the Tesla 
showroom, he is coming to get the eastern premiers to focus on the plush
 velour and eight-track deck and ignore the 450 cubic inch gas-guzzling 
engine.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 fact is he's too late. Public demand and personal motivations have led 
the eastern premiers to wisely set out conditions to their agreement to 
support <span class="companylink"><b>Energy</b> East</span>. These cannot be met, and presumably, they know it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The premiers' first and 
most important condition is that they want Canada's greenhouse gas 
emissions reduced, not increased. This is not possible while expanding 
the tarsands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With currently approved 
projects, the tarsands are already on track to ensure Canada fails to 
meet its very modest 2020 international carbon reduction targets. 
Expanding the tarsands would wipe out all the climate benefits of 
closing Ontario's coal-fired electricity plants and the emissions 
reductions achieved by Quebec and B.C.'s carbon taxes. The carbon 
produced solely from extracting the oil that would fill <span class="companylink"><b>Energy</b> East</span>
 would be equivalent to adding 7 million cars to Canadian roads. That 
excludes emissions created when the oil is refined and burned in the 
far-offcountries for where it is destined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ontario and Quebec 
premiers both want assurances that the pipeline won't burst. This can't 
be done because oil pipelines have an increasingly frequent habit of 
rupturing. <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s first section of the Keystone pipeline in the United States leaked 12 times its first year and the <span class="companylink"><b>Energy</b> East</span>
 line is even sketchier. The plan is to put high pressure oil in a 
50-year-old gas pipe in Ontario and then build a ship terminal smack in 
the middle of an endangered Beluga whale habitat in Quebec. Oh, and the 
gas line <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> plans to use exploded spectacularly in Manitoba last winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Social acceptance</b> 
is another of the premiers' criteria and demonstrating that becomes more
 improbable each day. Quebecers are chipping in money for efforts to 
oppose the pipeline ($385,000 and counting) and more municipal councils 
are lining up against the project every day. <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>
 seems to know that the public will not be supportive and until last 
week was working with global PR firm Edelman to create the illusion of 
local support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario and Quebec have 
little to gain from this project. Major gas utilities are taking out 
full-page newspaper ads opposing the project, and gas users are 
demanding to know why they should pay higher prices to help tarsands oil
 be shipped to port. The jobs associated with the pipeline are few and 
temporary and would never offset the costs of a major leak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, <span class="companylink"><b>Energy</b> East</span>
 is needed only to support expansion of the tarsands. At almost 2 
million barrels per day already, the tarsands are generating jobs, taxes
 and profits that are important to Alberta and Canada. Those benefits 
won't stop if production does not rise to 7 million barrels per day over
 the next 10 years as industry wants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Massive carbon emissions,
 toxic leaking tailings, social ills in Fort McMurray, trampled First 
Nation treaty rights, cancer clusters and destruction of the boreal 
forest are real challenges that must be addressed. Canadians know we 
need to take a deep breath and figure out how to solve these problems 
and use today's wealth to transition our economy to one less dependent 
on fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our bet is Premiers 
Philippe Couillard and Kathleen Wynne will say as much to Premier 
Prentice, and advise him that they're not interested in a Town Car. 
Maybe they'll even gently suggest he invest in a Tesla. Tim Gray is 
executive director of Toronto-based Environmental Defence and Sidney 
Ribaux is executive director of Montrealbased Equiterre.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">skrashinsky@globeandmail.com</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's
 an annual tradition, a showcase for advertising creativity that 
attracts big-budget competition. It is arguably the only time viewers 
actually look forward to watching some ads. In the United States, of 
course, that time is the Super Bowl. In Britain, however, it's 
Christmas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the holiday 
shopping season is of undeniable importance for retailers everywhere, it
 is a highly anticipated competition in creativity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It gets an awful lot of 
chatter," said Alan Middleton, a marketing professor with the Schulich 
School of Business at York University, who hails originally from London.
 “The production budgets to do a special ad for this crucial time of 
year are big."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, retailer
 John Lewis has become an institution. In 2011, the company made a huge 
splash with an adorable chronicle of a child's perception of time – how 
waiting for Christmas can seem like an eternity. The heart-wrenching 
twist was that when the big day finally arrived, he didn't maniacally 
tear the wrapping from his own presents. What he had been waiting for 
was to race into his parents' room with his own crudely wrapped gift – 
for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, it has delved into the dream world of a boy and his imaginary friend, Monty the Penguin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Lewis ran teaser 
trailers leading up to its ads, a strategy that has become the norm for 
the massively hyped U.S. Super Bowl ads. The company declined an 
interview for this story, but said in a statement that the cost of the 
campaign was £7-million, or more than $12-million – a significant 
investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monty now has his own <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> account, with more than 33,000 followers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Lewis is selling a 
children's book based on its charming story, as well as a line of 
products including mugs, sweaters, ties, onesies, socks and ornaments. A
 pair of stuffed plush penguins sold out within hours. The store is also
 creating Monty-themed displays, to draw traffic from people who loved 
the ad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many British companies tug on the heartstrings in their advertising this time of year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grocery chain Waitrose 
tells the story of a painfully shy girl asked to make gingerbread 
cookies for the school Christmas fair. Repeated failed attempts at the 
perfect cookie are presented as an analogue to her struggle for <b>social acceptance</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pharmacy chain Boots 
shows an exhausted family travelling through the night on Dec. 26, all 
to create a makeshift Christmas to surprise a loved one who is a nurse 
and worked through the holiday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supermarket giant 
Sainsbury's reached back 100 years for its ad, telling the story of a 
break in fighting on the Western front during Christmas 1914.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the ad is 
beautifully shot, it has also been controversial. Some viewers resented 
Sainsbury's using the story of a tragic war where millions lost their 
lives, to sell groceries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sainsbury's made the ad 
in partnership with the British Royal Legion, and is selling 
retro-looking chocolate bars like one featured in the ad, with profits 
going to the Legion. Sainsbury's declined requests for an interview for 
this story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christmas is a crucial 
sales season everywhere, and certainly holiday-themed ads fill the 
airwaves in North America as well. But many of them don't have the same 
blockbuster quality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the United States, 
this could be because many of the biggest advertisers are preparing for 
the Super Bowl, just a couple of months away, Prof. Middleton suggests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American advertisers 
spend millions every year – $4-million (U.S.) last year just for 30 
seconds of airtime during the game, not including the cost of making the
 ad – because it's a chance to reach millions of viewers. In a world 
where appointment TV viewing has fallen off drastically, that's a rare 
opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's another reason 
Britishstyle Christmas campaigns are not as prevalent in North America: 
There has been an increased focus both in the U.S. and Canada on 
pre-Christmas sales (as opposed to waiting for Boxing Day discounts). 
Storytelling is a good tool for brandbuilding, but it does not mesh when
 advertisers are focused on the hard sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The season has become so
 important that people are out there hustling the sales," he said. “The 
idea of doing an emotional message isn't the same type of fit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if Canadian 
advertisers wanted to produce these kinds of creative Christmas ads, the
 budgets here are nowhere near as large as they are in Britain, Prof. 
Middleton added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tearjerker ads have 
become more common everywhere as brands seek to create a powerful bond 
with consumers through storytelling. But it's not all emotional: some 
advertisers have gone for humour to do the job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, luxury retailer <span class="companylink">Harvey Nichols</span>
 got its Grinch on with an uproarious campaign called “Sorry I spent it 
on myself." The retailer created a line of terrible gifts – including 
“real wood" toothpicks (83 cents) and more – and invited people to buy 
“a little something for them, a bigger something for you."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a hit. The entire 
chintzy line of 26,000 items sold out within 48 hours. The campaign won 
four Grand Prix awards for the chain and its agency, Adam&amp;EveDDB, at
 the Cannes advertising festival.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The response was overwhelming," said Shadi Halliwell, group marketing and creative director at <span class="companylink">Harvey Nichols</span>. “For us, it is the main campaign of the year and we plan for the festive season a year in advance."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company will release its holiday ad in the first week of December, and it will have the same tongue-in-cheek approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“People react to humour," said Anne-Marie Verdin, brand director for another British luxury retailer, Mulberry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mulberry hired 
Adam&amp;EveDDB this year for its own cheeky campaign. The ad, which has
 attracted nearly one million views online, tells the story of an overly
 competitive family trying to “Win Christmas" by giving the best gift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A young girl receives a 
portrait of herself, a puppy and a unicorn, but conniving grandma wins 
the day with the season's it-bag. The despondent boyfriend waves away 
his unicorn as grandma smiles smugly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story is a kind of analogy for what is going on in the ad world in Britain at this time of year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is a tremendously 
strong creative culture," Ms. Verdin said. “At Christmastime, all those 
great creative people really roll up their sleeves. It is an unofficial 
competition for people to have the best ad, and certainly in the U.K. 
the amount of creative <b>energy</b> that has gone into everybody's 
campaigns is really phenomenal. … It's kind of a fun moment of sport for
 people interested in media, marketing and design." ON THE WEB Watch the

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the new boss of the <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span>,
 the agency tasked with weighing the $12-billion proposal, said climate 
change policy isn't within its purview and the board doesn't intend for 
its hearings to become bogged down in that debate.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario and Quebec, two of the six provinces <span class="companylink"><b>Energy</b> East</span> would traverse as it carries crude from Alberta to the East Coast, announced a raft of agreements on Friday, including on <b>energy</b> matters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premiers Kathleen Wynne 
and Philippe Couillard on Friday agreed to build ``a stronger and more 
competitive low-carbon economy'' to fight climate change and set out a 
list of ``principles'' for new oil pipelines in their provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of those would be to ``take into account the contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEB chair and CEO Peter 
Watson, who's been in the job for three months, said the NEB weighs the 
emissions pipelines themselves generate _ a minuscule amount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, much to the chagrin 
of pipeline critics, Watson said it's not the board's job to look at a 
project's enabling role in oilsands growth and the rising carbon dioxide
 emissions that would accompany that development. Nor is it the board's 
job to look at how crude products are burned for <b>energy</b> at the other end of the pipe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That authority rests with provinces and other regulators, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">``Our job is to assess the need for new cross-border <b>energy</b>
 infrastructure and to make sure it can be constructed and operated 
safely and in the public interest,'' Watson said in a speech to the 
Economic Club of Canada on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">``Our job is not to 
conduct a referendum on society's use of fossil fuels every time a 
proponent proposes to build a section of pipe.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Watson also said reviews 
must be conducted in a timely manner, but that he ``won't hesitate'' to 
extend the legislated 15-month time limit if more information is needed 
or more stakeholders need the chance to be heard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Watson said the <b>energy</b>
 board used to garner little attention, but now he's in the ``eye of the
 storm'' as the issue of pipeline safety rises in the public's 
consciousness. Last year, the board fielded 600 inquiries from the 
media, compared with just 80 in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company proposing to build <span class="companylink"><b>Energy</b> East</span>, <span class="companylink">TransCanada Corp</span>. (TSX:TRP) filed its application _ all 30,000 pages of it _ to the NEB last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project would connect
 more than one million barrels a day of Alberta crude to export points 
and refineries in Quebec and New Brunswick, making use of a repurposed 
natural gas pipeline for two thirds of the way and building new pipe for
 the rest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides emissions, 
Ontario and Quebec's other oil pipeline principles centre on safety, 
emergency response, aboriginal consultation, economic benefits, the 
company's responsibility to address a spill and the interests of natural
 gas consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">``We are studying these 
principles and look forward to working with both governments in the 
appropriate manner to make the project successful,'' said <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>
 spokesman Tim Duboyce, adding the project would create thousands of 
jobs and bring in billions of tax revenue in the two provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Natural Resources
 Minister Greg Rickford said he doesn't think of the demands by Ontario 
and Quebec as a lack of confidence in the NEB process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">``They just want to make 
sure that their interests are represented and that's a conversation that
 goes directly, in this instance, between <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> and those provinces.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta Premier Jim Prentice said he's not concerned Ontario and Quebec may stand in the way of the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">``This project is a 
nation building project and I take the comments that they made in that 
spirit,'' he said, adding he plans to meet with his counterparts in both
 provinces in the weeks ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">``I think we can all work together and I think we can do business together.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tim Gray of Environmental Defence said Ontario and Quebec have ``shown leadership'' with Friday's environmental announcements.</p>

 (CRA) opened its snitch line for people to denounce neighbours who they
 think aren't paying their fair share of taxes. One thousand promptly 
did so, showing that Canadians are either a civic-minded lot, or perhaps
 truly malicious. Frankly, it doesn't matter, because a culture that 
promotes snitching is an actual or incipient police state. Not only 
that, but one that doesn't care who knows it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many states relied on informers historically, but reliance isn't the same as <b>social acceptance</b>.
 While most monarchies and quite a few republics utilized spies and 
stool pigeons, few regarded them as clubbable. It took the advent of 
totalitarianism to make the snitch a peer, from which it quickly emerged
 as primus inter pares, or in George Orwell's formulation, more equal 
than others.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wikimedia CommonsPavel Morozov, 13-year-old supersnitch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pinnacle was reached 
by societies of the old Soviet model, in which being the leadership's 
eyes and ears was the ideal level of enlightenment for a socially 
conscious person to attain. A young man named Pavel Morozov attained it,
 according to the official myth, detailed in several biographies, when, 
at the age of 13, he became the ultimate snitch by heroically denouncing
 his own father. Little "Pavlik" lost his life at the hands of his 
father's vengeful family, but was beatified by the Soviet state, 
celebrated in songs, festive events, an opera and a symphonic poem for 
having his priorities straight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CRA has no such plans for
 its snitches, but while they can forget about symphonic poems, they can
 snitch anonymously and risk-free, and even get a percentage of taxes 
recovered as a reward. It's ironic that such an NDP-ish policy should 
first be introduced under a Conservative government, but life would be 
dull without such ironies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the Conservative 
snitch line brings to mind a character from French literature, named 
Mateo Falcone, whose Corsican culture took a dim view of snitching. 
Mateo's 11-year-old son couldn't resist the lure of a pocket-watch a 
gendarmerie officer offered him as a bribe and pointed out the haystack 
where a fugitive was hiding from the authorities. When Mateo came home 
and found out what happened, he took little Fortunato's watch and 
smashed it against a rock, then took the boy into the fields, had him 
say his prayers, and shot him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have come a long way 
from the world of Prosper Merimee's short story. In Mateo's moral 
universe - the opposite of the USSR - an informer is a blot on the 
family honour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wrong is in the act 
of informing, and it's neither aggravated nor mitigated by what one 
informs about. Merimee illustrates this by setting his story in the 
inbred society of Corsica, where most people are related. The fugitive 
whom Fortunato gives away is a cousin, but so is the officer of the 
gendarmerie who wants to arrest him. It doesn't matter. Ratting is 
intrinsically villainous. It leaves a stain that can only be removed by 
blood.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contrast this with our 
snitch culture, where so-called whistleblowers, far from being regarded 
as moral cripples, are positively celebrated as heroes. We glorify 
snitches, not only when they risk their lives to help to bring robbers, 
murderers or terrorists to justice, but when they rat on whoever is 
designated by the state as politically incorrect: A polluter, a 
surreptitious smoker, an illicit consumer of excess <b>energy</b>, the 
owner of an unregistered war souvenir, the purveyor of a sexist joke. 
The intrusive, regulatory state actually mandates snitching in certain 
areas, obliging teachers and medical workers to report what they may 
interpret as a possible sign of domestic or child abuse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I prefer Mateo Falcone's 
world. Barbaric as it may be, it's no more barbaric than offering 
incentives to disgruntled business or domestic partners to reveal or 
make up some dirt about each other for a percentage of the state's take,
 or enabling nosey, envious neighbours to decide that on your salary 
your wife shouldn't be driving a sports car.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For make no mistake, 
that's what 995 of 1,000 calls amount to on dedicated snitch lines. 
People who want to report a mugging, a drunk driver or a home invasion 
call 911, not 1-800-TaxChat.</p>

that the ban deals another blow to the fracking industry, which is

"turning away an opportunity to attract investment into the province,"

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Nova Scotians just

commercial quantities of gas. The company – which has active leases in 
the provinces – would not comment on Wednesday's announcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nova Scotia does have 
significant gas production from offshore fields, Sable Island and Deep 
Panuke, and Mr. Younger said the provincial government would focus on 
the offshore for future development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province also has 
ambitious proposals to export liquefied natural gas (LNG), but 
proponents are still looking for supplies of gas to feed those projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nova Scotia decision 
comes as neighbouring New Brunswick faces an election fight this fall in
 which fracking will be a major issue. New Brunswick Conservative 
Premier David Alward supports shale-gas development. But his Liberal 
challenger, Brian Gallant, has vowed to impose a moratorium on fracking 
pending further study – a position supported recently by federal Liberal
 Leader Justin Trudeau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advances in horizontal 
drilling and hydraulic fracturing have sparked a boom in natural gas and
 oil production in the United States, driving significant economic and 
employment growth while keeping a lid on prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Western Canadian 
provinces have long allowed fracking to develop both natural gas and 
tight oil, Quebec has imposed a moratorium, as have several U.S. states,
 including New York, and countries such as France and Germany.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a study this spring, 
the Council of Canadian Academies concluded that there simply isn't 
enough known about the impacts of hydraulic fracturing to declare it 
safe, though it acknowledged the enormous economic benefits that come 
with shale-gas development.</p>

resource management company, said. "We're a resource-based company - 
this is what we do. (But) in some ways we're too small. Petronas doesn't
 call up TDB Consulting."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Prince George-based 
TDB has been working for 27 years supporting the forestry and resource 
sectors, and currently employs about 50 people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While major <b>energy</b> sector players like Petronas and <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> don't call companies like TDB Consulting, their contractors and subcontractors do, Mynen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're working very hard 
on the route access, route selection process. We want to help them find 
the route for their pipelines," he said. "Our specialty is 
transportation design: roads, bridges ... Once the pipe hits the back of
 the truck, we're done."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mynen said TDB has been working to be ready when the LNG boom comes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have been gearing up,
 adding capacity, getting more professional ... adding professional 
engineers, professional foresters ... That's not an overnight type of 
thing," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked what challenges his company faces, Mynen summed it up in one word: labour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The word is out there 
that northern B.C. is getting developed," he said. "You always lose a 
few (workers) to other projects. And just through attrition, you lose 
people. Finding those replacements - any replacements - is a problem. 
You don't find people in (Prince George) any more. You used to be able 
to scoop grads from (the College of New Caledonia) and (University of 
Northern B.C.)."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TDB has had to change how it recruits to fill positions, he said, with recent hires coming from Vancouver, Ottawa and Halifax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are a lot of 
things you have to do, and you can't do it last-minute. If you're not 
already in dialogue when the announcements are made, it's too late."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lead time for major 
projects can be years and work begins long before final government 
approvals and company investment decisions are made, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eight years ago, TDB did some aerial photography for what is now <span class="companylink">Chevron</span> and <span class="companylink">Apache Canada</span>'s

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mynen said he doesn't expect natural gas development and LNG to redefine his company, but "it's exciting times."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building the boom Gary 
Giese, operations manager for Prince Georgebased construction company 
High Caliber Contracting, also sees exciting times ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High Caliber is a small 
construction company, employing up to 56 people. Giese said the biggest 
crew he's ever had on a single job is 27 people - but that could change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If it wasn't for the 
LNG, we'd look at a growth curve of 30 per cent year, 40 per cent per 
year," he said. "But what I see coming up is 100 per cent growth every 
year. We did a million last year, we're looking at $2.5 million this 
year and (could be) looking at $4-4.5 million in a year's time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Giese said High Caliber 
is "putting all the pieces in place" to ensure the general contractors 
and major subcontractors know the company is ready and able to take on 
subcontracting work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of those steps 
included completing the Browz safety program, he said. Browz offers 
contractors a searchable database of compliant contractors in each area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to working 
directly on LNG projects, Giese said he expects to end up working on 
projects resulting from the increased economic activity in the north.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The spinoff is going to be incredible, too," he said. "There is nothing that has ever happened in B.C. (like this)."</p>

extensions: the North Montney Mainline and Merrick Mainline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> anticipates spending $14.5 billion on the four projects, Kmet said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There will be employment
 opportunities with these projects, and contracting opportunities," he 
said. "We are engaged in skills training and education with local 
institutions. Our focus will be in preparing students for jobs on the 
pipeline."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> is not the only company looking to begin construction within the next couple of years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Chevron Canada</span> and <span class="companylink">Apache Canada</span>
 have EAO approval in hand for their proposed Pacific Trail Pipeline. 
The partners are expected to announce their final investment decision on
 the project by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Final investment 
decisions on the proposed LNG Canada terminal in Kitimat and 
650-kilometre Coastal GasLink Pipeline Project linking the terminal to 
Dawson Creek are expected next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, Spectra <b>Energy</b>
 applied to the EAO for approval of its Westcoast Connector Gas 
Transmission project - an approximately 854-kilometre-long pipeline from
 northwest of Fort St. John to the proposed Prince Rupert LNG export 
facility on Ridley Island - next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earning trust</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether LNG projects get 
built will depend as much on market conditions, and the level of public 
support or opposition, as government approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enbridge's proposed Northern <span class="companylink">Gateway</span> pipeline from the Alberta oilsands to a marine terminal in Kitimat received federal government approval this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a recent 
Angus Reid poll, 34 per cent of Canadians and 40 per cent of British 
Columbians believe the project should not have been approved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vocal opposition from 
First Nations and environmental groups means the project is expected to 
face legal challenges, protests, blockades and potentially a citizen's 
initiative petition against it if the provincial government approves the
 project. Federally, the NDP and Liberal Party have vowed to overturn 
the federal government's approval if elected in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Provincially, the B.C. 
NDP is opposed to the project, and the B.C. Liberals have said the 
project has not demonstrated it meets the five conditions required for 
provincial approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LNG projects have not drawn the same level of public criticism as the proposed oil pipeline, but Kmet said <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> has been working with First Nations and communities along the proposed route to earn public support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We didn't just look at 
one 900 kilometre route, we reviewed over 2,000 kilometres of routing," 
Kmet said. "Our business exists to deliver gas safely to homes and 
businesses. (The project) needs <b>social acceptance</b>, it needs community support and it needs to be environmentally responsible."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LNG FAQs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT IS LNG?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liquefied natural gas 
(LNG) is natural gas cooled to -160 C, when it becomes a liquid 
approximately 600 times denser than natural gas at room temperature. The
 gas is typically cooled at marine terminals, where it can then be 
loaded onto specialized tanker ships for export overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Natural gas is primarily 
composed of methane gas, with smaller amounts of ethane, propane butane,
 and pentanes. It formed as a result of organic matter decaying 
underground millions of years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Natural gas is burned for heating, electricity generation and transportation fuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Natural gas burned for 
power generation creates 545 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent 
greenhouse gas emissions per kilowatt hour (gCO2/kWh), compared to 778 
gCO2/kWh for diesel/heavy oil, and 1,000 gCO2/kWh for coal on average, 
making natural gas the lowest emitting of the fossil fuels. However, 
renewable sources such as reservoir-based hydroelectric and wind power 
produce 39 to 52 times lower emissions during their lifetime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PROVINCIAL RESERVES B.C. 
has an estimated natural gas reserve of 2,933 trillion cubic feet 
(equivalent to 60.23 billion tonnes of LNG), primarily in the shale rock
 formations of the Horn River and Montney basins in northeast B.C. 
Current production in B.C. is four trillion cubic feet of natural gas 
(equivalent to 82.14 million tonnes of LNG) per year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Natural gas is primarily 
harvested from shale rock formations using a controversial process known
 as hydraulic fracturing or fracking, which uses pressurized liquids to 
fracture rock and allows gas to ow through the cracks to the well. 
Fracking has been linked to groundwater contamination, loss of fresh 
water, seismic instability and other environmental and health issues in 
jurisdictions around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LNG POTENTIAL The B.C. government commissioned <span class="companylink">Grant Thornton LLP</span>
 to conduct an independent assessment of the potential impact of LNG on 
the B.C. economy, based on five projects moving ahead to completion by 
2021. The consultant estimated it would result in $98.4 billion in 
capital expenditures; create more than 39,000 direct, indirect and 
induced jobs on average during construction; create approximately 75,000
 direct, indirect and induced jobs during operation; and generate $130 
billion to $180 billion in government revenue during 30 years.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On paper, a pipeline to the west coast makes good sense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a world plagued by Middle East instability and Islamic terrorism, Canada's <b>energy</b> resources will be in greater demand and must be able get to market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Governments need the 
oilsands' revenue to maintain coveted social programs and other public 
services, and Canadians need the jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Northern <span class="companylink">Gateway</span>
 pipeline, 1,172 kilometres long, would represent a tiny but important 
component among the nearly 250,000 km of pipelines now criss-crossing 
the country. For the most part, it is a network that operates fairly 
safely, helping obviate the need for more precarious truck and rail 
shipments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But none of that is 
likely to change the views of project opponents. They, understandably, 
worry about the impact of a potential bitumen spill, especially along 
B.C.'s spectacular coastline. They legitimately are concerned about 
ramifications for B.C.'s tourism industry and its fishery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enbridge spokespeople readily acknowledge they have much work to do to gain <b>social acceptance</b>
 in B.C. for the project. But, if the company moves forward in the next 
15 months - its own estimate of the time needed for Northern <span class="companylink">Gateway</span> to be shovel-ready - in the same manner it has conducted its business in the last 15 months, prospects are not encouraging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company claims it has
 support of 50 per cent of inland aboriginal groups, without having 
identified a single one. And, of course, it lacks the support of any 
aboriginal groups on the B.C. coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason for this can 
be traced back to the project's inception. Instead of engaging with 
native people at the start of the enterprise, consulting on ways to get 
to "Yes," and taking account of aboriginal views in the design phase, 
Enbridge presented the project as a fait accompli and focused on 
peddling benefits through equity-sharing agreements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, Ottawa - the 
party with the constitutional responsibility for aboriginal consultation
 - for the most part, left it to the company to fulfil the Crown's 
obligation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Harper government named Doug Eyford as its Special Federal Representative on West Coast <b>Energy</b> Infrastructure to engage the aboriginals but waited until a year ago to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eyford lamented recently:
 "Some of the communities that are today threatening judicial 
proceedings and civil disobedience were at one time requesting meetings 
with federal officials and making what I believe, in retrospect, were 
feasible proposals to address the environmental and other issues 
associated with the project ... Regrettably, there was no uptake."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor has the company 
presented a convincing case to the broader community. In Kitimat, where 
residents have most to gain financially from <span class="companylink">Gateway</span>, people voted in a plebiscite to reject the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enbridge's choice of 
pipeline route was highly controversial, with a terminus port on the 
Douglas Channel where tankers loaded with heavy oil would be forced to 
navigate narrow, dangerous waters. The company - admittedly, at greater 
expense - could have opted for a more direct route through Prince 
Rupert, where a port already exists and is close to the open ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also has been noted 
that Enbridge has yet to make any offer to the province that would 
provide significant financial reward in compensation for the significant
 risks B.C. would undertake. Why would B.C. agree to any scenario in 
which Alberta gets the royalties, and B.C., the risks?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way of adding value 
to B.C. from the project would be by way of a refinery and upgrader in 
the province, preferably in eastern B.C. which not only would provide 
employment but also address the worry of transporting goopy bitumen 
across B.C. lands and water. Enbridge has put no effort into such a 
worthy pursuit. It perhaps would not be the most commercially viable 
component of the project but a helpful add-on to entice B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so, the company must 
now spend the next while doing battle in the courts, dealing with 
lawsuits launched by aboriginals and environmentalists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another important task 
for Enbridge, and among the required 209 conditions, will be getting 
firm commitments from would-be shippers of petroleum on the line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With so many threats of 
civil unrest and lawsuits, and with both the federal Opposition Liberals
 and New Democrats stating this week they would kill the project if they
 form government following the 2015 election, securing those contracts 
could be difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Firm predictions for Northern <span class="companylink">Gateway</span>
 are best left to the fortune tellers. But it would appear, if a sod 
turning is ever going happen, Enbridge will have to undertake a 
substantive redesign of the project.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We’re going to hear a lot about social licence in the next little while as the Harper government makes its ruling on <span class="companylink">Enbridge Inc</span>.’s Northern <span class="companylink">Gateway</span> oil pipeline through British Columbia to the Pacific Coast.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Social
 licence – or lack thereof – looks to be the scourge of traditional 
business plans in B.C. as fears grow about the ability of Enbridge and 
others to proceed in the face of opposition. Experience in <b>energy</b> and a solid forecast for returns take back seats to it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But social licence also seems to be a major factor in spawning off-the-wall <b>energy</b>
 projects. This week, a group led by an executive with Grupo Salinas, 
the Mexican conglomerate, proposed an untraditional $10-billion West 
Coast refinery that would take in bitumen from Alberta’s oil sands and 
export gasoline and diesel to Asia. The idea is to remove the risks of 
bitumen spills from tankers. The group also intends to focus on First 
Nations support and spend as much as $3-billion on carbon capture and 
renewable <b>energy</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan follows a 
similar one touted by B.C. newspaper publisher David Black that would 
ring in at more than $30-billion, including pipelines and tankers. Mr. 
Black said he has Chinese financing lined up for the Kitimat project, 
and all that remains is for Ottawa to kick in loan guarantees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the transport front, Vancouver’s Aquilini Group is backing the proposed Eagle Spirit <b>Energy</b>
 pipeline and upgrader that would send processed synthetic light crude 
across the Rockies to the Pacific, with the aim of it becoming a First 
Nations-supported initiative. Under the plan, diluted bitumen would get 
shipped across little, if any, of the B.C. mainland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, none of these ideas would have been considered without Northern <span class="companylink">Gateway</span>’s
 tumultuous long march to decision day and the issues that have coloured
 it – debates about oil spill risks on land and in water, First Nations 
fears about loss of traditional culture and control over land, carbon 
released by expanding oil sands development and the oil industry’s quest
 for new markets and higher prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interestingly, in its 
conditional approval of the $7.9-billion project last December, the 
Joint Review Panel made a point of saying it did not base any of its 
decision on social licence. That leaves Northern <span class="companylink">Gateway</span>’s supporters and detractors to argue whether the project has it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having expended loads of political and diplomatic capital on transpacific <b>energy</b>
 trade, the federal government is expected to approve the project. 
Regardless, it will take milliseconds for opponents to say that Enbridge
 failed to gain social licence to proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here’s the problem: The 
concept of social licence is imprecise at best. There is no central 
department of social licensing, and no accepted checklist to determine 
if an industrial project should be granted one (although B.C. Premier 
Christy Clark has a framework with her five environmental, aboriginal 
and economic conditions that she says oil pipelines must meet).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Out West, CEOs talk often
 about the need to operate in a manner that ensures social licence, that
 is, in a way that society on the whole approves of. Yet, it’s rare to 
hear one admit even a few demerits to their project. Their staunchest 
opponents also believe that industry must behave in a way that is 
acceptable to everyone, yet <b>energy</b> projects seldom pass their opponents’ standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hence the ideas for pipes
 and plants that seek to address the biggest hurdles for the traditional
 players. Enbridge, for instance, has pledged to keep trying to build 
relationships and seeking support from First Nations when and if it gets
 Ottawa’s final nod. Still, some of those bands have said they are ready
 with legal challenges, opening up the prospect of further lengthy 
delays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The untraditional 
refinery and upgrader proponents, though, have not presented formal 
plans for profitable enterprises, including little details such as lists
 of willing, long-term buyers for products rather than raw bitumen, 
expected margins, support from oil sands producers that have actually 
sought to diversify markets, and ideas for attracting and housing the 
legions of skilled construction workers they want to hire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Old-school oil companies such as <span class="companylink">Imperial Oil Ltd</span>., <span class="companylink">Suncor <b>Energy</b> Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Cenovus <b>Energy</b> Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Husky <b>Energy</b> Inc</span>.
 all operate major refineries and aim to export bitumen from the oil 
sands. None have come forward with a plan to build a new refinery 
thousands of kilometres from either the end market or production source.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s not a lack of social licence stopping them. If they could see the business case, they’d probably try it.</p>

 was much talk during Quebec’s latest election about the possibility 
that Quebec could be sitting on a substantial oil find under Anticosti 
Island that could be worth, according to former premier Pauline Marois, 
about $45-billion, although those reserves are still not confirmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last February, a few 
short weeks before calling a general election, the former Parti 
Québécois government announced an investment of $70-million in order to 
take an ownership participation in an exploration project on the island.
 This decision surprised many, as shale oil and gas exploration had been
 the subject of intense debate over the previous five years, even among 
PQ cabinet ministers prior to gaining power in September, 2012.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generally speaking, Quebeckers have historically preferred clean <b>energy</b>
 such as hydroelectricity over the development of a shale oil and gas 
industry. Still, until cars, buses and trains all go electric, Quebec 
will nonetheless continue to import about $12-billion worth of 
hydrocarbons every year. All that being said, shale oil exploration on 
Anticosti Island has been more favourably received than previous shale 
gas exploration efforts on the north and south shores of the St. 
Lawrence River, given the extremely limited population of the island 
(about two hundred people on an area about 14 times the size of the 
Island of Montreal).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We agree that 
environmental studies are needed before any oil production gets going on
 Anticosti Island. Still, the importance for the new liberal government 
to follow in the PQ’s footsteps should not be understated. A look at 
provincial gross domestic product per capita shows that oil exploitation
 directly correlates with a higher standard of living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using 2012 data, we find 
that the standards of living were $80,516 in Alberta, $72,159 in 
Saskatchewan and $65,964 in Newfoundland and Labrador, the three 
oil-producing provinces. These figures are way above the Canadian 
average of $52,177, as well as the standards of living of the two most 
populated provinces, Ontario ($49,940) and Quebec ($44,428). <b>Energy</b>
 production also helped those provinces increase their working-age 
population, mainly through interprovincial migration, contributing to 
healthy public finances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are of course other
 factors at play to explain real personal income growth, such as labour 
productivity, capital intensity and employment rates (Newfoundland and 
Labrador actually ranks last in this category), but the opportunity to 
produce oil is a real game changer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Statistics Canada and the <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of Commerce</span>
 (see chart 
(http://www.theglobeandmail.com.ezproxy.lib.ucalgary.ca/report-on-business/real-income-per-working-age-resident-in-us-quebec-and-other-canadian-provinces/article18326051/#dashboard/follows/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com.ezproxy.lib.ucalgary.ca/report-on-business/real-income-per-working-age-resident-in-us-quebec-and-other-canadian-provinces/article18326051/#dashboard/follows/])),
 average real income in the working-age population grew by more than 80 
per cent in Canada’s three oil-producing provinces between 1989 and 
2012, compared to less than 25 per cent for the rest of Canada and 30 
per cent in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason this matter is
 vital to the province of Quebec is that this opportunity could be a 
much-needed fix to solve its trade deficit and one day reduce its 
dependency on equalization payments to finance its generous social 
programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebeckers do have a soft
 spot for environmental issues, which is a good thing in itself. 
However, if Quebec decided to not even go ahead with an exploration 
project on Anticosti Island, it could become legitimate for some 
Canadians to start calling into question Quebec’s business model and its
 addiction to equalization payments, which are projected to reach more 
than $9-billion in the coming year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We fully agree that any 
oil production must be done the right way. If proper consultations and 
scientific studies come to the conclusion that the Anticosti project is 
economically feasible in a way that respects the environment and, also, 
the project garners <b>social acceptance</b> among the residents of Anticosti Island, then Quebec should choose the responsible avenue and go ahead with oil production.</p>

it has decided to build as much support as it can for the project in the

crude for March delivery added $1.55 to $97.27 on the New York Merc, 
while Brent for March added 68 cents to $107.37 (all figures in this 
para U.S.). Western Canadian Select traded at a discount of $18 to WTI 
($79.27), unchanged. Natural gas for February added 15.8 cents to $5.00.
 The TSX <b>energy</b> index added 2.99 points to close at 270.50.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">TransGlobe <b>Energy</b> Corp</span>.
 (TGL) lost 54 cents to $8.28 on 737,700 shares. Investors were 
disappointed with the Egypt-focused company's year-end update, which 
showed lower year-over-year reserves, production decreases at the core 
West Gharib and West Bakr projects, and another abandoned well at South 
Alamein. TransGlobe blamed the reserve and production declines on poor 
exploration results and mechanical problems. The abandoned well, West 
Manar, was not much of a surprise. It was the second well of a two-well 
program and the first well, Taef No. 1, turned up dry. The wells cost 
TransGlobe a total of $4-million. The company remains interested in this
 area because Taef and West Manar are right next to the Boraq discovery,
 which could begin production in 2015, assuming the military moves its 
operations in the area and grants approval for development. TransGlobe 
expects Boraq will eventually add 8,000 to 10,000 barrels a day to the 
company's total output. Year-to-date production is 19,000 barrels a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a conference call 
this morning, TransGlobe's management said 2013 proved too difficult for
 reserve additions, but the company is "now moving at full speed" and 
expects to make up for it in 2015. It has tweaked its production 
guidance to account for potential delays in bringing projects on stream.
 For example, both Boraq and Northwest Gharib were forecast to start 
production in 2014, but those have been pushed back by a year. Still, 
the overall goal of doubling production to 40,000 barrels a day in 2018 
is unchanged, and management had another carrot to dangle: It has 
started a financial review "to confirm that the company is in a position
 to initiate a sustainable dividend." It will make a final decision 
after it reviews its financial statements on March 4. If it does start a
 dividend, said management, it would probably be a quarterly dividend 
effective March 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Canacol <b>Energy</b> Ltd</span>.
 (CNE) added 46 cents to $6.96 on 1.06 million shares. Its Mono Arana 2 
appraisal well in Colombia's Middle Magdalena Valley has found 244 feet 
of net oil pay in the Lisama formation. It has not tested the well yet, 
but by comparison, the Mono Arana 1 well found 85 feet of net oil pay 
and tested at 1,242 barrels of oil a day. Canacol's goal is to finish 
five more Mono Arana wells by June, with expected production of 6,000 
barrels of oil a day (2,400 net). These wells are targeting shallow 
conventional resources. The Middle Magdalena Valley is also prospective 
for deeper shale -- in fact, Canacol refers to it as Colombia's "shale 
oil sweet spot" -- but those are harder to bring on production. The Mono
 Arana 1 well, for example, found 230 feet of pay in the deeper La Luna 
formation, so Canacol and joint venturer <span class="companylink">ExxonMobil</span>
 decided to re-enter the well specifically to test La Luna. Results were
 expected in mid- to late 2013, then December, and now the first 
quarter. The Oso Pardo 1 well, another attempt at targeting deeper 
shale, failed to penetrate La Luna because of mechanical problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bankers Petroleum Ltd</span>. (BNK) added eight cents to $4.37 to 4.94 million shares. Much of the volume came from <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span>,
 which crossed 2.85 million shares at $4.31 this morning. The company 
seems to have created a feel-good documentary about its activities in 
Albania. Yesterday, a <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> user 
called Albania Oilfield uploaded an hour-long video (which happens to be
 this user's only video) called "Bankers Petroleum -- Patos Marinza," in
 Albanian but with English subtitles. The documentary is filled with 
workers, executives and locals alike praising the Patos-Marinza heavy 
oil field and Bankers' ever-valiant efforts to hire plenty of locals, 
clean and protect the environment, and provide social services from 
schools to bridges. The film is light on details of future plans. 
President and chief executive officer David French does say he plans to 
increase production by 15 per cent every year, and he can easily imagine
 Patos-Marinza's output doubling to 40,000 barrels of oil a day. Chief 
operating officer Suneel Gupta said that in the next few years, as 
production increases, Bankers will focus on expanding the export market.
 All of the oil currently goes to the Mediterranean, but Mr. Gupta wants
 to start looking at Asia and even the United States. The film's 
narrator concludes: "Bankers Petroleum Albania today is the leader in 
the oil industry in the country. The giant of the Albanian underground 
is awake." In the last few seconds of the credits, the text "<span class="companylink">Bankers Petroleum Albania Ltd</span>.
 Copyright 2013" appears. The film was produced by an Albania-based ad 
agency called SourceOne. Both Bankers and SourceOne are members of the 
Canada-Albania Business Council, along with other Canadian companies 
such as <span class="companylink">Stream Oil &amp; Gas Ltd</span>. (SKO: $0.60), <span class="companylink">Petromanas <b>Energy</b> Inc</span>. (PMI: $0.14) and miner <span class="companylink">Tirex Resources Ltd</span>. (TXX).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The friendly film is well timed. Last week, local news outlets reported that state-owned Albpetrol and the ministry of <b>energy</b>
 are accusing Bankers of illegally selling low-quality diluent in the 
domestic market without paying taxes. They are basing this on the 
increased amount of diluent the company has been importing. Bankers 
denies this and says all of the diluent is used for licensed operations,
 namely underground injection to dilute the heavy oil and make it easier
 to pump out. The increased amount of imported diluent has to do with 
the increased level of production, which was 19,300 barrels of oil a day
 in the fourth quarter. It is unlikely that the accusations will go 
anywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pipeline hysteria: This 
afternoon, about 100 protesters paraded a 91-metre inflatable pipeline 
around the Capitol ahead of Barack Obama's State of the Union speech 
tonight. The pipeline was emblazoned with: "Pipeline President or 
Climate Champion? NO KXL," in reference to <span class="companylink">TransCanada Corp</span>.'s
 (TRP: $48.38) Keystone XL. They chanted, "Get up, get down, keep fossil
 fuels in the ground," and accused the pipeline of "terrorizing our 
planet and our people." The protesters "aren't holding their breadth 
[sic] waiting for a mention of Keystone XL," according to <span class="companylink">350.org</span>'s press release -- the President did not say anything about it in last year's address, although he said "<b>energy</b>"
 18 times -- so today's antics seemed more about grabbing attention than
 anything else. Gimmicks are always a good strategy, as the Skwomesh 
Action group can attest. It held an event in Delta two days ago to help 
the Unist'ot'en camp oppose basically every development proposal in the 
B.C. Interior and most of Alberta. To drive traffic, it offered 
gluten-free pancakes and mimosas made with organic juice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Enbridge Inc</span>.
 (ENB: $46.59) had some tentatively good news. A joint B.C.-Alberta 
working group has prepared a report on moving Western Canadian oil and 
gas to Asian markets. The document is marked "strictly confidential," 
but was released to B.C. and Alberta reporters yesterday. It talks of 
developing "broad <b>social acceptance</b>" of projects and also sets 
out some preliminary recommendations and milestones for the next 18 
months. The recommendations stem from the five conditions B.C. has put 
on its acceptance of Northern <span class="companylink">Gateway</span>. Alberta <b>Energy</b>
 Minister Diane McQueen told the Canadian Press that some of the 
suggestions in the report will help meet those conditions. The report 
estimates that Canada is losing out on $50-million a day in potential 
revenue by not having pipelines to carry product to Asia.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A joint British 
Columbia-Alberta government working group focused on getting Western 
Canadian oil and natural gas to Asian markets says progress on issues 
such as spill prevention, First Nations engagement and sharing the 
economic benefits will come this year or early next, according to a 
report prepared for Premiers Christy Clark and Alison Redford.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The
 document – marked as “strictly confidential” but released to reporters 
in B.C. and Alberta on Monday – speaks mostly in broad generalities 
about the work to date and provides little in the way of specific plans.
 But it does lay out some timelines for progress, guiding principles, 
plans for creating a “world-class” marine and terrestrial spill regime, 
and notes the two provinces need to enter into negotiations with Ottawa 
regarding the “financing” for the infrastructure improvements to 
highways, ports and airports needed to gain access to Asia-Pacific 
markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report talks about developing “broad <b>social acceptance</b>”
 of projects by being more responsive to those with environmental 
concerns, using tools such as social media and addressing 
“misinformation” about natural resource sector growth. It reiterates 
that Alberta’s oil and gas royalties are not on the table for 
negotiation when it comes to getting economic benefits to British 
Columbians, but the B.C. government has the right to negotiate with 
industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Ultimately, the work 
being done today will help us to fulfill our shared commitment to create
 jobs, stimulate long-term growth and to position Canada as a true <b>energy</b> superpower,” said the December report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public concern in B.C. 
over the safety and environmental risks of oil-sands pipelines – 
particularly spills on land or off the West Coast – prompted Ms. Clark 
in 2012 to lay out five conditions related to the environment, First 
Nations consultation and financial benefits in order to support 
oil-pipeline development in the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, 2013, Ms. 
Clark and Alberta’s Ms. Redford said their two provinces had reached a 
framework for an agreement to satisfy B.C.’s demands, and had 
established a joint working group to work out the details. In the 
December report from public servants in both provinces, the document 
said the benefits of the oil and gas industry extends to all Canadians 
but B.C. faces “risks” that Alberta does not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of particular concern to B.C. residents is the proposed 1,177-kilometre Northern <span class="companylink">Gateway</span> pipeline. If built, the <span class="companylink">Enbridge Inc</span>.
 pipeline would bring oil-sands bitumen to Kitimat, B.C., from 
Bruderheim, Alta. In December, an independent body mandated by the 
federal Environment Minister and the <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span>
 – the joint review panel – gave a conditional green light to the 
project. That recommendation will inform a federal cabinet decision to 
come in the first half of this year as to whether to give final approval
 to the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, it was only last
 May that the B.C. government formally rejected the proposed 
525,000-barrel-a-day pipeline, telling the federal panel conducting 
hearings on the project that the company has failed to adequately 
explain how to deal with a major heavy oil spill on land or in coastal 
waters.</p>

 petitioned a Quebec court on Dec. 5, seeking to force the province's 
environmental minister to allow underground uranium exploration at the 
company's Matoush project, located in the Otish mountains 200 kilometres
 northeast of Mistissini.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebec's
 Minister of Sustainable Development, the Environment, Wildlife and 
Parks had denied Strateco's permit on Nov. 7 after the local Mistissini 
Cree community refused to consent to uranium development near its 
hunting grounds and trap lines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Many Cree work in the mining industry; we are not anti-development,” said Cree Grand Chief Matthew Coon Come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But uranium is a special
 case. The tailings will remain toxic for hundreds of thousands of 
years. It is a burden for future generations that we are not prepared to
 assume.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strateco's CEO, Guy 
Herbert, said the Matoush project is crucial to the development of the 
company's assets in northern Quebec. He estimated that the project could
 produce 30 million pounds of some of the highest-grade uranium in the 
world – worth roughly $1.7-billion at current market prices – and 
channel $800-million to Quebec over 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the company has 
invested almost $125-million in the project since 2006 and obtained 22 
different permits from the environmental ministry. He said the 
authorization at issue now would be the final hurdle in its protracted 
fight to move the project forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have the law on our side,” Mr. Herbert said. “This is public land. …We have the right in Quebec to mine uranium.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Cree view 
Strateco's legal wrangling as a last-ditch attempt to undermine their 
rights under the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement of 1975.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Matoush project
 is located on provincial territory, its disposition still requires Cree
 consultation under the treaty, said lawyer for the Cree, Jessica Orkin 
of Sack Goldblatt Mitchell in Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The treaty also created 
an elaborate environmental review process, the first of its kind in 
Canada, and the minister must consider a number of factors, including 
both Cree input and the rights of resource developers, in approving any

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The minister's Nov. 7 decision stated that the lack of <b>social acceptance</b> by the local Cree communities was “obvious and determinative” in denying Strateco's permit.</p>

<tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before
 year-end, B.C. Premier Christy Clark and Alberta Premier Alison Redford
 are scheduled to receive the report of a joint working group on the 
movement of heavy oil through this province to the coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The working group, 
staffed with senior public servants from both provinces, was established
 last summer in a bid to harmonize policy-making between the two 
governments and put paid to the breach that preceded the recent B.C. 
election.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime
 goals: "Opening new markets and expanding export opportunities for oil,
 gas and other resources. Creating jobs and strengthening the economy of
 each province and Canada through the development of the oil and gas 
sector."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deliverables: "Increased 
liaison with Alberta on pipeline projects moving heavy oil and/or oil 
byproducts through B.C. Working with other government agencies, cies, 
provincially and federally, to ensure the B.C. and Alberta goals are 
met. Common co-ordinated communication."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terms of reference, 
released in October, established five working teams under assistant 
deputy ministers Al Sanderson from Alberta and B.C.'s Fazil Mihlar 
(until recently The Vancouver Sun's associate editor).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One team is charged with 
smoothing over the main source of the earlier breach, namely dark 
suspicions that B.C. was seeking a cut of the royalties Alberta collects
 on the provincial oil resource.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big misunderstanding, 
ing, according to the terms of reference: "It is not about royalty 
sharing but rather about receiving a fair share of the economic and 
fiscal benefits of a proposed fis-heavy oil project that reflects the 
levels, degree and nature of the risk borne by B.C., the environment and
 taxpayers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With that in mind, the 
fiscal and economic team has been instructed to: "Establish the range of
 views on the fiscal and economic benefits relative to the costs and 
risks borne by each province; identify potential means and mechanisms 
that would create an equitable sharing of fiscal and economic benefits 
that reflect the costs and risks resulting from the projects; and define
 next steps in developing a strategy for enacting the appropriate 
mechanisms."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not much doubt that it is
 mainly up to B.C. to figure out how to secure a piece of the action, 
probably by tapping the companies with a levy on pipelines or oil 
exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joint progress is more 
likely from the team working on the most cost-effective and least risky 
method for transporting Alberta oil through B.C. "If pipelines are not 
developed, rail will step into the void to deliver bitumen to the West 
Coast," declared the terms of reference in an unmistakable warning to 
the no-pipelines branch of the no-growth crowd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transportation 
working team has been directed to compile an inventory of port, rail, 
road, and other infrastructure improvements needed to expedite the 
delivery of heavy oil and other <b>energy</b> resources to tidewater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A third working team is 
dedicated to the well-worked-over territory of oil spills, on land and 
at sea. To minimize duplication, the team is expected to co-ordinate 
with existing federal and provincial efforts to minimize risks and beef 
up resources for cleaning up spills when they happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The terms of reference 
suggest that marine spills could be better handled by "a unified command
 and incidence response structure" based on the one already in place in 
the U.S. Land spills would benefit from a "harmonization" between 
Alberta and B.C., including establishment of industryfunded resources 
that would be available for quick response and cleanup in either 
jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A fourth team is tackling "social licence" - namely, what it will take to engage the public and</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">build support. Suggested 
areas to explore: "Define engagement in the context of the projects; 
identify key areas that need to be addressed and continually maintained 
in order to develop broad <b>social acceptance</b> of the projects; and define next steps for developing a strategy that could address key areas that have been identified."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the head start seized by opponents of the proposed Enbridge Northern <span class="companylink">Gateway</span> pipeline, I wouldn't bet the engagement team will meet with much success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plus there's the no-less 
formidable obstacle to success poised by the mandate for the fifth 
working team, "developing a strategy for engaging First Nations." To 
which I would add: "at this late date."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Alberta and B.C. 
pledge to work together on an approach to First Nations, the terms of 
reference acknowledge that in one important respect they are far apart: 
"Alberta is covered by a series of numbered treaties that reduce some of
 the complexity faced by B.C." Alberta has flexibility in its dealings 
with First Nations; B.C. has no choice but to engage each affected First
 Nation in depth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not likely will the working group and its five subsidiary teams be able to do much to improve the odds of success for Northern <span class="companylink">Gateway</span>.
 But there is also the proposal to twin the existing Kinder Morgan 
pipeline, which is expected to move to the formal application stage 
later this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the working group,
 it is expected to deliver up a report to the respective premiers by 
Dec. 31, including recommendations and an action plan "that may be 
considered for implementation." Note the word "may." While the mere 
existence of the working group shows relations are on the mend between 
B.C. and Alberta, it is too soon to say whether they will ever be on the
 same page on pipelines and petroleum.</p>

 on the grassroots level for large-scale infrastructure projects that 
are required to gain access to new markets remains compromised, as 
opposition groups continue to win the public relations battle and often 
use delay as their tactic of choice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while proponents of 
the various proposed LNG and pipeline projects that would allow 
producers to ship product from Canada's West Coast work hard at leveling
 the playing field through education and science, the task is daunting 
as emotive sound bites from opponents often capture the ear of the 
public over companies' technical approach.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ian
 Anderson, president of Kinder Morgan Canada, which is proposing a 
$5.4-billion expansion to the Trans Mountain crude oil pipeline to the 
West Coast, says the project is a prime example of the new reality that 
companies face in their efforts to gain a social licence to operate and 
put pipe in the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The project we're 
embarking upon is really the completion of a phased expansion of the 
system. In 2008 we completed the first phase, which was expanding 
through Jasper National Park and Mount Robson Provincial Park, which are
 two World UNESCO Heritage Sites," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We completed that late 
in 2008, which is not even five years ago, and there was nowhere near 
the debate, controversy, opposition and the media coverage we're seeing 
today. That's what we're seeing today, so in a five-year time-frame 
things have changed dramatically."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michal Moore, an <b>energy</b>
 economics professor with the University of Calgary's School of Public 
Policy, says the tactics being used by environmental groups and other 
opponents continue to evolve as their efforts to stymie the advancements
 of infrastructure projects ramp-up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The evolution of the 
tools that opposition groups are using are all based around delay, 
distortion of information and the repetition of that distortion," he 
says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Ask yourself how rapidly
 a false or misleading statement ... makes it around when it's 
disseminated through social media? You can have a false statement that 
gets repeated so often that it becomes a truth -- and assumed truth [in 
the public realm] -- in literally minutes," Moore adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The changes seem to me 
to have occurred in large measure because of the impact of repeating 
lies and distortions or misinformation, including misunderstood 
information or data. The approach to this is to vulcanize 
decision-making and do it in such a way that projects can't get critical
 mass and, as a consequence, they die."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Tertzakian, chief <b>energy</b> economist at <span class="companylink">ARC Financial Corp</span>., agrees that the landscape for <b>social acceptance</b> and support of <b>energy</b> projects continues to change with more pressure being placed on companies to justify the benefit-versus-risk component.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's much different than five years ago. Five years ago the issue of social licence was taken care of by the <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span> [NEB] and there was a lot more trust in our institutions," Tertzakian says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Today, the NEB, which 
was supposed to be the custodian of social licence on behalf of 
Canadians, seems to be marginalized and the onus regarding the social 
licence issue is now on the industry to justify what they are trying to 
do."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changing times</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Canadian Society
 for Unconventional Resources (CSUR) started out about a decade ago its 
main focus was facilitating and enabling technology transfer and 
dialogue between its members, as well as public education efforts, 
though not to the degree seen today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with political and 
public concern about coalbed methane development in the early- to 
mid-2000s, and then the early days of horizontal drilling and 
multi-stage fracturing later in the decade, the group's role started to 
change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The issues didn't just 
come up from the regulatory bodies, we heard the same questions at our 
stakeholder engagement sessions. It started out where you would have 10 
landowners that were concerned about what was happening, to 20 or 30 or 
more in a session -- the scope was getting bigger," says CSUR executive 
vice-president Dan Allan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says the context of 
those discussions started changing dramatically, especially when 
industry started exploiting shale gas and tight oil plays, whether it be
 concern about large-scale horizontal drilling and multi-stage 
fracturing programs or the infrastructure required to move product to 
tidewater facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It morphed from just the
 stakeholder being interested -- the guy directly affected -- to the 
public at large being interested because they were now concerned about 
the size and scope, they were concerned about the industry's 
credibility, because maybe they heard about a pipeline break in the U.S.
 and therefore the whole industry had to be called into question," Allan
 says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This was a level of 
scrutiny we've never seen before. There's almost been a new industry 
created in North America of environmental groups, watchdog groups, 
social media groups -- anyone who's looking at anything that may or may 
not fit in their estimation -- and they've got the money and the passion
 for their efforts," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can't fault anyone 
for asking questions, but I think it's more than that now. The levels of
 miscommunication are just staggering.... This intense scrutiny, 
probably driven by social media, has made industry's job very, very 
difficult."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Leach, president of 
the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada (EPAC), says that some
 sophisticated opponents, many of whom are not directly affected by a 
particular project, want to use the public review process to delay or 
derail oil and gas development projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think that projects 
can still undergo a world-class review without sacrificing timeliness 
and certainty and we have delivered this message to the Alberta 
government too," he notes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leach adds that it is 
difficult to explain complex issues -- particularly the trade-offs that 
have to be made -- to find a reasonable balance among the social, 
economic and environmental issues raised by oil and gas development and 
infrastructure projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Too often, the general 
news media fails this basic role and repeatedly demonstrates how easily 
it is willing to be distracted by well-choreographed protesters, such as
 those who recently blocked the doors to the NEB hearings in Montreal on
 the <span class="companylink">Enbridge Inc</span>. crude oil line reversal," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Individual corporations 
and associations have responded with sizeable public advertising 
campaigns. Even the federal government is getting into this advocacy 
marketplace with a recently announced multimillion-dollar advertising 
campaign to promote the oilsands."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tertzakian says industry has come out of the denial phase and has recognized the need to increase efforts to gain public trust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's not to diminish 
the efforts that have already been made, but there is a greater 
recognition that you can't just do the application for social licence at
 the corporate level, the government level -- going to Ottawa for what 
I'll call 'suit-to-suit' combat," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's not where the 
exclusive focus has to be now. It's on the ground, engaging with the 
communities and telling them what they're doing and working hard at 
making the public understand the process," Tertzakian adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is where there 
still is a great deficiency, but I do think there are many companies 
that are starting to get it and act successfully on it. But boy, there's
 a lot of work to do."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leach says that one idea that the upstream and midstream industries are looking at to bolster public support for <b>energy</b>
 development is continuous improvement in industry performance in areas 
that directly impact public perception, for example safety and 
environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We all know in this day 
and age that a single incident anywhere in North America by an oil and 
gas producer, a pipeline operator or a rail car company can negatively 
impact the reputation of the entire industry," Leach says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Canadian pipeline 
industry has recently introduced its own program backed up by an 
advertising campaign to inform the public in key markets. Organizations 
like the <span class="companylink">Canadian Standards Association</span>
 are interested in expanding their involvement with the oil and gas 
industry in this area and EPAC and others in the upstream sector are 
looking at the concept of 'standardization' to see what aspects may be 
applicable to our highly diverse and complex upstream industry."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corporate leaders need to step up</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tertzakian believes one 
component that is currently lacking is the resolve of high-level 
corporate leaders to take a more hands-on approach to the grassroots 
dialogue that occurs as projects go through the process of gaining a 
social licence to operate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There aren't enough -- I
 can only really think of one [Kinder Morgan's Anderson] -- CEOs and 
industry leaders that are willing to stand up and show their face, make 
statements publically and go and interact in communities like Kitimat on
 a routine basis," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They have a tendency to 
send foot soldiers out. When I first started out [in the early 1980s], 
the champions of the industry were not shy to speak up and stand up and 
be advocates. It's hard to think of many industry leaders that are 
leading the charge of being an advocate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anderson views public 
engagement as a vital part of his job, a situation he says has changed 
over the years and one that will continue to evolve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Whether it was the 
upstream producers or the pipelines, we have kind of come out of a 
decade or two of focusing on attracting capital, deploying resources and
 maximizing production capabilities and all of that goes with 
technological improvement and access to labour and so forth," Anderson 
says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Facing the public is not
 something the producers were doing a decade ago in a large way and 
certainly not what the pipelines were doing. That has fundamentally 
changed," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think I recognized 
some years ago that I was not going to rely upon consultants and staff 
to go into the hard corners. We need to, as an industry, go into the 
tough corners -- you don't always win in the offensive zone, you need a 
good defensive game, too."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anderson notes that the 
"tough corners" include interaction at the municipal level with local 
elected officials, First Nations communities and even opponents of a 
project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think we need to go to
 all of those places to get a full appreciation of what the issues are. I
 always say all issues are local, politics are local and in many 
respects all benefits can be defined locally," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's when you 
appreciate what's important to the people whose lives you're impacting. 
And if you're not investing the time there, I don't think you're fully 
understanding and appreciating what you can do to make a difference."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Theal, head of 
Calgary-based Kootenay Capital Management Corp., says progress is being 
made as industry continues its efforts to improve stakeholder and public
 engagement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"On the LNG front, I 
think you're starting to see the right things. You need the federal and 
provincial government, the First Nations and the companies all under one
 roof talking about the fiscal equation and the environmental equation. 
If everyone under that tent can get aboard, then it works," Theal says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think with Northern <span class="companylink">Gateway</span>
 and Keystone XL, it's been a reactionary process. I think that's the 
key -- you have to get everyone in a room and find an economic, 
environmental and social solution that works for everyone."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delay of game</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a report released in October 2012, the <span class="companylink">Fraser Institute</span>
 pointed out the many non-economic factors that are front and centre in 
the debate, and contribute to the snail's pace of moving projects 
forward to the decision-making phase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"British Columbia could 
benefit greatly by exporting LNG to the Asia-Pacific Region. However, 
opposition by special-interest groups, out-dated, cumbersome, and 
overlapping regulations, along with other non-market factors, are 
inhibiting the development of the pipelines and terminal facilities 
required to ship LNG from Canada's West Coast to Japan, Korea, China, 
India, and other Asian countries," said the authors of the report, Gerry
 Angevine and Vanadis Oviedo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However the report, 
called Laying the Groundwork for B.C. LNG Exports to Asia, noted that 
existing outdated regulatory processes and procedures, unnecessary 
duplication of federal and provincial government project reviews, and an
 unwieldy environmental review process could impede the timely 
development of a Canadian LNG export industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If the federal and B.C. 
governments believe it is important to secure a niche for British 
Columbia's gas resources in the Asia-Pacific market, they should 
consider introducing reforms to streamline the regulatory approval 
process and thereby expedite development," the authors say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CSUR's Allan agrees, 
adding that prolonged delays in the regulatory process can compromise 
the "window of opportunity" for projects to succeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So if you are a group 
opposed to development of fossil fuels, all you have to do is delay. 
That's a huge advantage -- they don't have to stop it, they just have to
 delay it," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I just think that 
democracy has seemed to have lost its way. It used to be we had a 
simplistic society where if you had 100 people in a small village and 
you get 60 to agree, that was it. Today we can get 60 per cent and it 
doesn't mean anything."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U of C's Moore says 
that anti-petroleum special interest groups are often masters at 
clogging up the regulatory process and, as a result, forcing delays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a history of the
 interest groups forcing a public agency or a public review body to look
 and say, 'You know what, maybe we should take another look.' It 
emboldens splinter groups to come in and carve off a point of view 
that's not necessarily in the broad public interest -- they are 
basically destroying the idea of the majority prevailing," Moore says, 
pointing to the failed Mackenzie Valley pipeline, and the current status
 of the Keystone XL pipeline to the U.S. Gulf Coast, as examples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a vulcanization 
that is not designed around finding the best and most coherent public 
policy or public investment in infrastructure, it's a negative approach 
that wins by stalling or throwing up impossible barriers or by diverting
 attention."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The regulatory dilemma</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry in Canada, 
no doubt, doesn't want to miss the boat of opportunity in relation to 
improving export opportunities, especially to the Asia-Pacific region 
and the growing economies, and respective increased <b>energy</b> demand, of some countries in that region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to move projects 
forward and seize that opportunity in a timely fashion, Moore contends 
it's going to take a concerted effort by both industry and government to
 gain the trust and confidence of a wary Canadian populace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"How do we get there? We improve <b>energy</b>
 literacy and we insist on egalitarian decisions and opinions by 
regulators and policymakers and get government to act responsibly and 
consistently," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The last part of the 
puzzle, one I know my friends in the environmental community don't like,
 is that we need rules and procedures that are religiously adhered to. 
That means you cannot use the regulatory arena for policy decisions," 
Moore adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not fair, it slows 
things down and it makes the job of trying to render a decision about an
 infrastructure project almost impossible. Somehow we need to empower 
our regulators to actually do their job and not to allow the regulatory 
arena to be used as a forum for policy decisions."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EPAC's Leach agrees that a tightening of the regulatory process is a must.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's well known that after the abuses by some non-government organizations of the Northern <span class="companylink">Gateway</span>
 hearings the federal government changed the rules on who is 
appropriately allowed to participate in NEB hearings. This has not made 
activists happy and one well-funded U.S.-based group has challenged 
these restrictions, first applied in the Enbridge Line 9 reversal 
application, in court as violating the Charter of Rights," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Alberta is grappling 
with similar issues as it introduces new rules for public participation 
in the regulatory review process and aboriginal consultation process. We
 are deeply concerned that the resulting rules do not overlook

 country's leading doctors' group has voted against wading into the 
debate about doctor-assisted death - drawing accusations from some of 
its members that they are burying their heads in the sand on an issue of
 profound importance to Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delegates to the annual general meeting of the <span class="companylink">Canadian Medical Association</span> (CMA) on Wednesday voted against a motion urging all levels of government to hold public hearings into "medical aid in dying."</p>
</td></tr><tr><td class="index" align="right" valign="top"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some
 doctors argued that it would be premature to call for nationwide public
 hearings when doctors themselves haven't decided whether they would be 
willing to participate in helping their patients end their lives, while 
others said it wasn't clear exactly what "medical aid in dying" means.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others were visibly exasperated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I have a bit of a 
problem understanding the attitude of my colleagues from other provinces
 regarding what's going on with this issue," said Dr. Ruth Vander-Stelt,
 from Gatineau, Que. "Canadian physicians outside Quebec do not want to 
talk about this issue of medical aid in dying. We can't talk about it. 
You have to shut your ears, shut your eyes and shut up," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vander-Stelt said she has
 her own "conscientious objection" towards a proposed Quebec law that 
would permit aid in dying for patients experiencing incurable and 
irreversible illness and suffering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Society is waking up - it's coming. We have to talk about it," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The debate was so 
contentious, delegates couldn't reach agreement on the wording or 
language, referring a motion to replace "physician-assisted suicide" 
with "physician-assisted death" on all future communications from the 
doctors' group to the board of directors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One doctor argued the word "suicide" can provoke the same negative emotions as "abortion" and "rape."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Dr. Robin Saunders, outgoing chair of the CMA's ethics committee, said it is time doctors "call a spade a spade."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Medical aid in dying is, in fact, euthanasia," he said. "That is the term we should be using."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's Criminal Code 
makes it an offence to counsel, aid or abet another person to commit 
suicide, punishable by up to 14 years in prison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Health Minister 
Rona Ambrose said this week that the government has no intention of 
reopening the debate. Nine private members bills seeking to 
decriminalize doctor-assisted suicide have all been defeated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But recent court cases, 
the proposed Quebec law and a rapidly aging population confronting its 
own mortality are pushing the issue into the public conscience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The baby boomer 
generation is starting to reach this inevitable crossroads in their 
lives," Saunders said. "This cohort - perhaps more than any other - is 
used to having control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Should physicians remain
 steadfastly committed to one of the most fundamental tenets of ethical 
practice - namely, to respect the value of human life, and not actively 
participate in (physician-assisted death) and euthanasia - or does the 
physician have the moral responsibility to relieve suffering even if by 
doing so death is hastened?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Pierre Harvey, of Riviere-du-Loup, Que., said the CMA's mandate is to be leaders in health care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Give me one good reason 
why, as leaders, we should not confront this inevitable question that 
has to be discussed everywhere in Canada? On what basis can we refuse to
 undertake a consultation on something so basic as this?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the issues are highly emotionally charged and sensitive, "it's undeniable that <b>social acceptance</b>
 of this is increasing," said Dr. Laurent Marcoux, president of the 
Quebec Medical Association. A 2013 survey found 86 per cent of Quebecers
 are in favour of medical aid in dying, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Incoming CMA president Dr. Louis Hugo Francescutti said doctors are not ducking the issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As someone who just lost their mom, this is an issue that's near and dear to my heart," the Edmonton emergency physician said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't think we ducked. What physicians do when they're not sure is pause and reflect and ask for consultation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another motion, 
delegates supported a doctor's right to exercise "conscientious 
objection" when faced with a request for doctor-assisted death, should 
the practice be legalized in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa physician Dr. Lee 
Donohue said many patients ask for her "aid, assistance, support and 
expertise in helping them to die, and their families ask me to do the 
same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For times in which they're asking me to do what I don't feel is in their best interest, or what I can't do, we talk about it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government is
 appealing a B.C. court ruling that struck down Canada's ban on 
doctor-assisted suicide, ruling it unconstitutional. The case is likely 
to reach the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 2011 survey of 16,000 
CMA members found that 38 per cent of doctors believe that assisted 
suicide should remain outlawed, while 34 per cent think it should be 
legalized. "We are a split profession," Saunders said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Doris Barwich, of the
 Canadian Society of Palliative Care Physicians, said two-thirds of the 
presentations to the Quebec national assembly were against medical aid 
in dying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a substantive 
body of literature and a lot of opinion around undoing 2,000 years of 
medical history and our oath," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's like cutting down an old growth forest - once you've gone a certain direction you can never can come back."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CMA represents 76,000 doctors in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other resolutions Wednesday, doctors condemned owners about the violence in the National Hockey League. In 2011, <span class="companylink">Montreal Canadiens</span>
 forward Max Pacioretty suffered a fractured vertebra and concussion 
following a violent check by Boston Bruins captain Zdeno Chara. <span class="companylink">Pittsburgh Penguins</span>' Sidney Crosby was sidelined for a year from concussions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not just 
professional sport," said outgoing CMA president Dr. Anna Reid. "We want
 to signal to young players that it's not OK to deliberately take your 
stick and hit someone over the head."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We speak on behalf of 
Canadians, we speak on behalf of our patients. When we speak out to 
prevent serious injuries that are intentional, I think people stand up 
and listen," Reid said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Francescutti said he 
regularly sees emergency patients with concussions and other 
hockey-related injuries. "Violence (in hockey) needs to be addressed. 
Don Cherry might disagree with me. But it's not an inherent part of the 
game," he said. "Anytime the goal is to send someone out on the ice to 
purposely hurt someone else, how could we support something like that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In spite of the public 
trying to get the NHL to take this issue seriously, they've haven't. 
Maybe if the CMA lends its voice to it then the NHL will take this a 
little more seriously."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delegates also supported a ban on the sale of <b>energy</b>
 drinks to youth below the legal drinking age as well as restricting the
 sale of sugary, high-calorie foods in sports and recreational 
facilities.</p>

 prices over the past decade. Indeed, the surging terms of trade (export
 prices relative to import prices) have stimulated corporate investment 
and job creation across the country, particularly in the Western 
provinces. Reflecting the importance of natural resources in the 
Canadian stock market benchmark, the S&amp;P/TSX has outperformed its 
U.S. counterpart seven times in the past 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with the U.S. shale

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remember peak oil theory?
 The members of this club argued that global crude oil supplies have 
peaked and entered an irreversible long-term decline, setting the table 
for permanently elevated oil prices. The concept didn’t account for, or 
at least underestimated, the impact of technological innovation fostered
 by rising <b>energy</b> prices. That’s what recently happened to 
natural gas prices in North America, which have plummeted from above $10
 (U.S.) per million British thermal units to under $4, as hydraulic 
fracturing (”fracking”) and horizontal drilling have unlocked huge 
reserves of natural gas believed unreachable as recently as five years 
ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, according to a recent report from the <span class="companylink">International <b>Energy</b> Agency</span>
 
(http://www.iea.org/newsroomandevents/pressreleases/2013/may/name,38080,en.html[http://www.iea.org/newsroomandevents/pressreleases/2013/may/name,38080,en.html]),
 booming U.S. shale oil production will send “shock waves” through the 
global oil trade over the next five years, in a development that could 
be as dramatic as the rise of Chinese demand over the past 15 years. The
 IEA predicted in its latest report that the U.S. will overtake Saudi 
Arabia as the world’s top oil producer by 2017, thanks to horizontal 
drilling and fracking. At 7 million barrels a day, the U.S. is currently
 producing more oil than it has in 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Putting aside some issues related to water management and <b>social acceptance</b>
 in populated areas, booming shale oil activity is more than welcome to 
stimulate the economy in many states such as North Dakota, Louisiana, 
Wyoming, Montana and West Virginia (to name a few), which are involved 
in this <b>energy</b> revolution. In addition, prospects on external 
trade are improving, with U.S. oil imports having already dropped to 
their lowest level in 16 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As far as Canada is 
concerned, the improved U.S. economic outlook represents good news in 
the short term and won’t immediately threaten our oil exports south of 
the border, as Canada has outpaced <span class="companylink">OPEC</span>
 as the U.S.’s number-one oil supplier. Over the medium and long term, 
however, we are much more concerned, since this new unconventional oil 
supply could have significant ramifications on global oil trade and the 
price outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heading towards a higher WCS oil price or a much lower WTI price?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the negative 
impact of the combined surging oil production from U.S. shale oil and 
the Canadian oil sands has been limited to an unusual price gap between 
Western Canadian Select (WCS) and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, 
stemming mostly from transportation bottlenecks and high level of 
maintenance from some U.S. refineries. The prevailing wisdom among 
Canadian experts is that this phenomenon is temporary, since the 
situation will correct itself when regulatory approval is received from 
Washington on the Keystone XL pipeline project or from the <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span> on several Canadian pipeline projects. We are not convinced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the traditional 
optimism from the IEA regarding oil demand increase (an additional 6 
million barrels a day from 2012 to 2017) fails to materialize due to 
prolonged stagnation in Europe or a deceleration in the Chinese economy,
 we must be ready for much weaker oil prices – unless <span class="companylink">OPEC</span>
 members agree to cut production. With its already shrinking global 
market share (now about 33 per cent), this potential call for <span class="companylink">OPEC</span>
 to reduce production and maintain current elevated oil prices in order 
to accommodate surging North American production will become an 
intriguing open debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bottom line: Canadian investors and policy makers should remain vigilant</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Canada’s crude oil 
exports are a critical driver of high-paying jobs, royalties, taxes and,
 ultimately, federal equalization transfers, all Canadians should 
closely monitor the impact of this <b>energy</b> revolution south of the
 border. In the short term, like many pundits, we believe that the 
current U.S. shale oil boom will help the U.S.’s still frail economic 
recovery, and not greatly threaten Canadian oil exports and oil sands 
projects. However, Canadian political leaders should remain vigilant 
about the willingness of Capitol Hill to authorize the Keystone project,
 given the strong opposition from environmental groups regarding the oil
 sands carbon footprint and the U.S.’s possible <b>energy</b> independence in sight by 2030.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Down the road, investors should also monitor <span class="companylink">OPEC</span>’s
 reaction (particularly that of Saudi Arabia, with its huge proven 
reserves), since artificially elevated oil prices will not necessarily 
be in their long-term strategic interests. Any intention from <span class="companylink">OPEC</span>
 to protect market share, or a decision from Washington to reject the 
Keystone project ,will send a disconcerting message regarding oil sands 
expansion and be a potential game changer for Canada.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government wants to ensure there is <b>social acceptance</b> before it green-lights the project, even if it is unclear Quebec has any legal say in the matter. The <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span>
 is already carrying its own public examination. But no one will say a 
word on this – certainly not Enbridge or Quebec's oil refiners, <span class="companylink">Suncor <b>Energy</b> Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Valero <b>Energy</b> Corp</span>., which would profit from access to cheaper Alberta oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Social acceptance</b> 
is the new religion, and to oppose this would be like declaring war on 
apple pie. But the fact is many hearings and summits such as the one on 
mining royalties are a waste of time. More often than not, they are an 
entirely predictable showdown between well-organized industry and green 
interests whose positions are irreconcilable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most people are left confused after listening to this dialogue of the deaf. On such divisive issue as pipelines, reaching <b>social acceptance</b> is close to impossible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a case where the 
Parti Québécois government should do what all governments have been 
elected to do: Put their pants on, make an informed decision and live 
with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enbridge wants to reverse
 the flow of the pipeline, Line 9, that runs between Sarnia, Ont., and 
Montreal so that it goes eastward, and increase its capacity to 300,000 
barrels per day from 240,000. Ironically, this was the line's original 
flow until the end of the 1990s, when imported oil became cheaper than 
western oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environmentalists have 
been criticizing Enbridge's project as a way of condemning Alberta's 
“dirty” oil sands, even if the light crude that would be flowing East 
could also come from the United States or Saskatchewan. However, the 
problem really lies with Quebec's demand for oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The PQ government hopes 
to position the province as a green tech hub and plans to electrify some
 of its public transportation with its electricity surpluses. But until 
the province's crude consumption truly decreases – and this can't be 
done overnight – it will continue to buy oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebec currently imports 
its oil from Europe and North Africa. Is the oil extracted in Algeria 
and shipped by tanker so much cleaner than western oil? And what about 
the Alberta oil that is now making its way by train, with the risks 
associated with derailments, such as the one that happened in Jansen, 
Sask.?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bigger issue is one 
of safety. Using pipelines is a secure way to ship oil, but when 
accidents happen they can be catastrophic, as in the Kalamazoo spill of 
2010, when an estimated 20,000 barrels of oil were discharged near the 
Michigan River. This is where Quebec needs to get tough – especially 
since the federal Environment Commissioner recently concluded that 
Canada is ill equipped to handle a spill should a pipeline burst or a 
tanker run aground. There can be no complacency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But once the necessary 
precautions are taken by the government and the industry, approving the 
reversal of Enbridge's pipeline should be a slam-dunk decision, so 
obvious are the benefits to Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting access to the 
cheaper Alberta oil will preserve, for the foreseeable future, Quebec's 
two last refineries: Suncor's in Montreal-East and Valero's in 
Saint-Romuald, on the south shore of Quebec City. Together, they employ 
around 1,000 workers. Montreal-East has already been hit hard with five 
refinery closures, and the dismantling of the <span class="companylink">Royal Dutch Shell</span> refinery, where 800 people worked, is still a vivid memory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Valero has also long 
committed to $140-million in additional investments in Quebec, should it
 access cheaper western oil, and the company's CEO, Brian Klesse, 
confirmed it this week again. The company plans to upgrade its 
Montreal-East equipment and maritime terminal at a cost of $110-million,
 and would invest another $30-million to expand its Saint-Romuald wharf.
 Another $60-million would help finance the acquisition of small 
tankers, but unless Chantier Davie Canada Inc. landed the contract, the 
money would be spent out of province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is only from 
Quebec's perspective; the money spent on western oil would also help 
Alberta and possibly narrow the price discount on Western Canada Select 
versus North Sea Brent crude. Quebec imported $13-billion worth of oil 
in 2012, which represented 60 per cent of the province's trade deficit, 
according to the Institut de la Statistique du Québec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jobs, investments and 
hey, even making friends in Alberta: Anyway you look at Enbridge's 
pipeline reversal project, this is a no-brainer.</p>
