<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could be worse, could be way better. Mostly, it'll be "meh."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Paris-based <span class="companylink">OECD</span>
 (essentially the membership organization of the world's developed 
countries) said Monday our GDP growth will be OK- not great, but not a 
recession, either. Employment growth will be slow, so will any rise in 
incomes, but at least unemployment shouldn't increase and inflation 
won't be out of control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All-in-all, Canada's economy will be, well, "meh."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why? Taxes and regulations, but mostly taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2015, when the 
Liberals and New Democrats took over in Ottawa and Edmonton, 
respectively, federal and provincial taxes on individuals and 
corporations have sucked much life out of our economy, along with insane
 new environmental regulations that are scaring away foreign investment 
in our <b>energy</b> sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, the <span class="companylink">OECD</span> also points to uncertainty about <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>. So Trump haters can blame Donald Trump's trade strategy a bit, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in recent years, federal and provincial governments have raised taxes so much that Canada has become less competitive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report, also Monday, for the Alberta government, <span class="companylink">Export Development Canada</span>, the <span class="companylink">Petroleum Services Association of Canada</span>, Canadian Global Exploration Forum and JWN, an <b>energy</b> industry media group, determined the best investment opportunities for Canadian oil companies were in ... the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How ironic. A report for 
the Alberta government and the federal government's export agency is 
encouraging Canadian companies to ship their money south.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crazy public policies are acting like rocks on the tail of the Canadian economic bird, changes such as subjecting any new <b>energy</b>
 development to "genderbased assessments" or making pipelines 
responsible for all the emissions created by the oil they carry, even 
emissions from the oil after it leaves the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But according to the <span class="companylink">OECD</span>,
 the biggest problem the Canadian economy has at the moment is taxes. We
 are raising ours rapidly while our largest trading partners, the 
Americans, have radically reduced at least their corporate taxes since 
last November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Alberta, for instance, the top corporate tax rates have increased by 50% since Premier Rachel Notley and the NDP took over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta Advantage is gone. Alberta's corporate tax rate is now as high as most other provinces'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the Harper 
government, Ottawa worked hard to make Canada's tax rates slightly lower
 than American rates. That resulted in corporate investment shifting 
northward for a decade or so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now the combination of uncompetitive tax rates, huge government deficits and "<b>social licence</b>" regulations has scared away tens of billions of investment dollars (along with the jobs those dollars would have created).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stubbornness of the 
B.C. government surrounding the Trans Mountain pipeline - and the 
unwillingness of the Trudeau Liberals to do anything strong about B.C.'s
 obstructionism - has foreign investors worried, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's one last insanity 
that is contributing to our "meh" performance: Fossil fuels brought into
 Canada are not subjected to carbon taxes or wacky environmental regs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millions of tonnes of 
U.S. coal are shipped to Asia each year through the Port of Vancouver 
without ever being charged a cent of federal or provincial carbon tax. 
The B.C. government, which is doing everything it can to stop Alberta 
oil, does nothing to limit dirtier U.S. coal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, none of the 
700,000 barrels of foreign oil imported into Canada every day is 
subjected to the environmental regulations every ounce of Western 
Canadian oil must meet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why would foreign 
investors pump money into Canada, only to have their oil or coal blocked
 and their income taxed through the nose, when they can import fossil 
fuels and get around the taxes?</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto pundits should 
not be so quick to write off the new Doug Ford-Scott Moe alliance 
against the federal carbon tax. Yes, they were the only two of the 10 
provincial premiers in New Brunswick this week to announce their support
 for a constitutional challenge to the federal law. And yes 
constitutional experts are correct in predicting that this legal 
challenge is not likely to succeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But winning in the legal 
battle does not mean winning the policy war. Obstructionist provincial 
governments can gum up federal policies whose effective implementation 
require provincial co-operation. Witness how B.C. Premier John Horgan 
and his antipipeline allies have succeeded in delaying the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline expansion despite losing 17 consecutive court decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With respect to the 
carbon tax, the law may be on the side of Ottawa, but time and politics 
are not. Saskatchewan's reference to its court of appeal won't be 
decided for another nine months. Whoever loses will appeal to the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>,
 which will take another year or more to be heard and then decided. By 
then, there will have been a spring election in Alberta and a federal 
election in the fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Alberta, Conservative 
leader Jason Kenney is promising to scrap that province's carbon tax if 
he wins next year's election. All current polling suggests that he will.
 Manitoba has adopted its own version of a carbon tax, but the price it 
places on CO2 is below the minimum demanded by the federal plan. Premier
 Pallister has warned that if Ottawa tries to force it higher, "we'll 
see you in court." P.E.I. has adopted a climate change plan with no 
carbon tax - a policy that clearly does not meet federal regulations. 
And if anti-tax momentum builds, the Newfoundland and New Brunswick 
premiers have warned that they are not going to impose a tax on their 
voters that consumers and businesses in six or seven other provinces are
 not paying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With next year's federal 
election fast approaching, this is potential nightmare scenario for 
Trudeau and the Liberals. Do they want to make the ballot-issue a new 
tax that will make it more expensive for voters to fill up their cars, 
heat their homes and turn on their lights? Maybe this won't make any 
difference in Saskatchewan and Alberta, where the Liberals only have 
five MPs. But in Ontario - where Doug Ford just won by promising to 
scrap the tax - the Liberals have 80 MPs seeking reelection. Losing even
 a quarter of these would jeopardize their 183-seat government, which is
 only 13 over the 170 minimum required for a majority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2015, many 
centre-right voters supported Trudeau simply because they were tired of 
Stephen Harper. But in 2018, they supported Doug Ford because they were 
tired of skyrocketing electricity and gas prices. If in 2019 Trudeau 
takes a hardline on bringing back the very carbon tax that Premier Ford 
has just repealed, he risks losing some of these former supporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the alternative - 
backing off on the carbon tax - has its own risks. Promising action on 
climate change was one of the issues that helped Trudeau win in 2015. 
With the help of the U.S.-financed environmental NGO (EN-GO) Leadnow, 
the Liberals targeted 29 Conservative-held ridings in which their 
polling indicated that climate change was a priority for voters. Liberal
 candidates subsequently won 25 of these seats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these same 
centre-left voters that supported Trudeau in 2015 are no longer so happy
 with him. Many are angry about the federal government's $4.5-billion 
bailout of the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline 
expansion in B.C. If Trudeau now backs down on his national carbon tax 
pledge, many of his 2015 supporters for whom climate action is still a 
priority may drift off to the NDP in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underlying the Liberals'carbon tax dilemma is the spectacular failure of the Trudeau-Notley "<b>social licence</b>"
 gambit: their belief that in return for their various carbon reduction 
policies, climate change ENGOs would acquiesce in Canada's economic need
 to build the Kinder Morgan Trans-Mountain expansion. Whatever 
plausibility this trade-off strategy may have had initially has now been
 destroyed. The anti-Kinder Morgan forces - the Horgan government, U.S. 
and Canadian climate ENGOs and B.C. Aboriginal groups - have accelerated
 their opposition to TransMountain, not backed off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor are they shy about explaining why. When CBC asked Bill Mc-Kibben, founder of <span class="companylink">350.org</span>,
 why he would not give Trudeau and Notley any credit for Canada's carbon
 reduction policies, he stated a simple fact: that at only two per cent 
of global emissions, what Canada does on the domestic "demand" side to 
reduce our emissions is too small to make any difference. What will make
 a difference, McKibben continued, is preventing the further development
 of the Canadian oil sands - the third largest reserve on the world. "To
 stop the oil sands, we have to stop all pipelines."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The failure of his <b>social licence</b> strategy forced Trudeau to rescue the TransMountain expansion with the $4.5-billion purchase of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada</span>.
 This did not win him many new friends in Alberta or Saskatchewan, but 
infuriated many of his erstwhile climate change supporters in Ontario 
and British Columbia. With an election only a year away, the carbon tax 
issue threatens to push the Liberals even deeper into a political corner
 with no easy way out.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any good things Donald Trump brings to the world are unintentional. But there could be one for Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's the best argument 
for a truly national economy that levels internal trade barriers and 
freely enables export of resources to Asia and Europe. This was overdue a
 decade ago. Now, it's imperative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before long, that guy 
might decide to throw tariffs on everything. How about, say, 20 per cent
 on Alberta oil? Enough of internal beer wars and licenceplate revenge. 
Enough of provinces flying into partisan heat and violating their own 
free trade agreements. Enough of B.C. Premier John Horgan, too. His 
government's obstruction of the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline now looks even more un-Canadian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stakes appear to be sinking in. The Trudeau government is changing tone, both in public and in private.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil and gas exports are in. <b>Social licence</b> isn't exactly out, but it's wearing a gag. Those used to be the first words federal Liberal ministers uttered about pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the order tends to reverse. Ministers are gung-ho about selling resources. Vows of doing it responsibly are secondary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Somewhere between Trump's
 election and Horgan's obstruction, light bulbs snapped on in high 
places. Just as a car licence is meaningless without cars, a <b>social licence</b> is ridiculous if there's no project to stick it on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The feds certainly aren't
 abandoning their environmental and climate-action goals. But the need 
to find alternative markets is suddenly imperative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The City of Burnaby, which refuses to pay policing costs for protests at the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 site, has issued eviction notices at the protest camp. Nobody will say 
it outright, but direct federal pressure on Burnaby is part of this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So is pressure from right across the street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burnaby residents with "good middle-class" jobs don't want riots on their front lawns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new natural resources
 minister is Amarjeet Sohi, from Edmonton. He is immediately a rare 
specimen. Many eastern Liberals worry that an Albertan in the top <b>energy</b> job will not be sufficiently contemptuous of the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last Liberal in this post was Edmonton MP Anne McLellan, who, like Sohi, counted her victory margins in tens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This appointment is a big
 boost for Sohi's hopes. It's also a clear signal from Prime Minister 
Justin Trudeau that developing non-U.S. markets is now a key priority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa is in the process 
of buying Trans Mountain for $4.5 billion, so it would be damn peculiar 
if Sohi started dissing it. He also supports Line 3 and Keystone XL, 
cross-border projects already in the works But the larger emphasis now 
is on ways of shipping east and west, rather than south.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are committed to 
selling our resources and expanding our markets not only internally, but
 also externally, to non-US markets," Sohi said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Relying on a single customer is not a good thing, and that's becoming more and more clear now, with the uncertainties around <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> ... we need to sell our resources to other markets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta PCs backed the world-market strategy, of course. Ex-premier Alison Redford was a key driver of the failed <b>Energy</b> East project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta NDP has 
pressed the importance of non-U.S. export for nearly two years. The 
United Conservative Party constantly demands wider market access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leader Jason Kenney 
congratulated Sohi in a video but also said if the Liberals really want 
to help they should dump Bill C-69, which imposes many new rules on 
projects, as well as Bill C-48, the north coast tanker moratorium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sohi says Bill C-69 is 
designed "to get good projects built as quickly as possible." He offers 
no hope for tankers to B.C.'s north because, he says, the coast is too 
remote to ensure quick spill response.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These bitter partisan 
differences endure. But there's something new; signs that all parties 
are starting to agree on greater export capacity to west and east, not 
just for oil and gas, but for minerals, agricultural and wood products 
and manufacturing.</p>

Amarjeet Sohi stands with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Governor 
General Julie Payette after being sworn in as Minister of Natural 
Resources, during a swearing in ceremony at Rideau Hall in Ottawa on 
Wednesday, July 18, 2018. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang ORG XMIT: 
JDT105</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new natural resources minister is Amarjeet Sohi, from Edmonton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is immediately a rare specimen. Many eastern Liberals worry that an Albertan in the top <b>energy</b> job will not be sufficiently contemptuous of the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last Liberal in this post was Edmonton MP Anne McLellan, who, like Sohi, counted her victory margins in tens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This appointment is a big
 boost for Sohi's hopes. It's also a clear signal from Prime Minister 
Justin Trudeau that developing non-U.S. markets is now a key priority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa is in the process 
of buying Trans Mountain for $4.5 billion, so it would be damn peculiar 
if Sohi started dissing it. He also supports Line 3 and Keystone XL, 
cross-border projects already in the works</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the larger emphasis now is on ways of shipping east and west, rather than south.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are committed to 
selling our resources and expanding our markets not only internally, but
 also externally, to non-US markets," Sohi said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Relying on a single customer is not a good thing, and that's becoming more and more clear now, with the uncertainties around <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> ... we need to sell our resources to other markets."</p>

 ), the north coast tanker moratorium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sohi says Bill C-69 is 
designed "to get good projects built as quickly as possible." He offers 
no hope for tankers to B.C.'s north because, he says, the coast is too 
remote to ensure quick spill response.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These bitter partisan differences endure.</p>

Mr. Marshall Koval reports</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LUMINA GOLD ANNOUNCES POSITIVE CANGREJOS PEA RESULTS; 373 KOZ GOLD PER YEAR OVER A 16 YEAR MINE LIFE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Lumina Gold Corp</span>. has received positive
 results of the preliminary economic assessment (PEA), prepared in 
accordance with National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for 
Mineral Projects, for its 100-per-cent-owned Cangrejos project. The PEA 
was authored by MTB Project Management Professionals Inc. (MTB) and 
demonstrates that Cangrejos has the potential to be an economic, 
large-scale open-pit gold and copper mine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Marshall Koval, president and chief executive officer, commented: "This 
represents a crucial first step in demonstrating the value of the 
Cangrejos project to both Lumina shareholders and Ecuador. The PEA 
establishes that Cangrejos is one of the top 15 undeveloped gold 
projects in the world (1) based on its average annual production 
potential. Our team is confident that with further drilling, engineering
 and study we will continue to increase the scale of the project and 
improve its economics."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(1) Based on a list of global active primary gold development projects from SNL Market Intelligence as of June, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preliminary economic assessment summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The PEA was initiated in 
late 2017 by MTB and contributed to by several consultants that have 
extensive expertise in their respective fields. Further details on the 
contributors can be found in the qualified persons section of this news 
release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All amounts are in U.S. 
dollars unless otherwise specified. Base-case economics are based on a 
gold price of $1,300 per ounce, copper price of $3.25 per pound, 
molybdenum price of $11 per pound and a silver price of $19 per ounce. 
The effective date of the PEA is June 27, 2018, and a technical report 
relating to the PEA will be filed on SEDAR within 45 days of this news 
release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The PEA's highlights include the following estimates:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Life of mine (LOM) average annual payable production of 373,000 ounces gold and 43 million pounds copper;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- 16-year mine life;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- 40,000-tonne-per-day processing operation from years 1 to 5, with an expansion to 80,000 tpd in year 6;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- LOM processed grades of 0.69 gram per tonne (g/t) gold and 0.12 per cent copper;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- LOM revenue mix of 76.5 per cent gold, 22.0 per cent copper and 1.5 per cent molybdenum plus silver;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Posttax net present value of $876-million at a 5-per-cent discount rate;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Posttax internal rate of return of 14.4 per cent;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Initial capital costs including working capital of $831-million;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Expansion capital including working capital of $406-million;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Average cash operating costs of $523/ounce and all-in sustaining costs of $569/ounce, net of byproduct credits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The PEA is preliminary in
 nature and includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too 
speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to 
them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. 
Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated 
economic viability. There is no certainty that the PEA will be realized.</p>

Inferred mineral resource notes:
(1) Mineral resources are reported as of Nov. 6, 2017. 
(2) Mineral resources do not have demonstrated economic viability. Currently there are no 
environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing, or other 
relevant issues that effect this mineral resource estimate, but these factors could effect 
the estimate in the future. 
(3) The quantity and grade of reported inferred mineral resources in this estimation are 
conceptual in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to define these inferred 
mineral resources as an indicated or measured mineral resource. It is reasonable to 
expect that the majority of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to indicated or 
measured mineral resources with continued exploration. 
(4) The mineral resources in this estimate were calculated with the <span class="companylink">Canadian Institute of
Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM)</span>, CIM Standards on <span class="companylink">Mineral Resources</span> and Reserves, 
Definitions and Guidelines prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions. 
(5) Gold equivalent values were calculated using the following prices: for gold a price 
of $1,400 (U.S.) per ounce, for copper a price of $3.25 (U.S.) per pound, for molybdenum 
a price of $10 (U.S.) per pound and for silver a price of $17 (U.S.) per ounce. Gold 
equivalent values can be calculated using the following formula: AuEq equals Au g/t plus 
(Ag g/t times 0.0138) plus (Cu percentage times 1.580) plus (Mo parts per million divided 
by 10,000 times 4.219). 
(6) The base-case cut-off grade for the estimate of mineral resources is 0.35 g/t AuEq. 
(7) The inferred mineral resources are contained within a limiting pit shell and 
comprise a coherent body.
(8) Total may not add up due to rounding.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This mineral resource 
estimate was prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 and 
was based on a total of 18,015 metres of diamond drilling in 50 holes. 
Of these, 10,376 metres in 23 holes were drilled by Lumina, 6,237 metres
 in 23 holes were drilled by the project's previous operator, Newmont 
Mining Corp., in joint venture with Lumina's predecessor company, <span class="companylink">Odin Mining and Exploration Ltd</span>.,
 and 1,402 metres in four holes were drilled by Odin after the joint 
venture was dissolved. Inferred mineral resources are estimated using a 
3-D block model with a nominal block size of 10 by 10 by 10 metres. 
Drill holes penetrate the Cangrejos deposit at a variety of orientations
 to depths approaching 700 metres below surface. The resource estimate 
was generated using drill hole sample assay results and the 
interpretation of a geological model which relates to the spatial 
distribution of gold, copper, silver and molybdenum. Interpolation 
characteristics were defined based on the geology, drill hole spacing 
and geostatistical analysis of the data. The effects of potentially 
anomalous high-grade sample data, composited to two-metre intervals, are
 controlled using both traditional top cutting as well as limiting the 
distance of influence during block grade interpolation. Block grades are
 estimated using ordinary kriging and have been validated using a 
combination of visual and statistical methods. Blocks in the model 
within a maximum distance of 150 metres from a drill hole are included 
in the inferred category. The estimate of the inferred mineral resource 
is within a limiting pit shell derived using projected technical and 
economic parameters.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mining and processing facility</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The PEA contemplates 
large-scale open-pit mining using a 100-per-cent-owner-operated 
equipment fleet. Four mining phases were designed using a technique that
 optimizes present value by discounting the value of ore-grade 
mineralization relative to the cost of mining overlying waste rock. Mine
 production and concentrator feed schedules were estimated from the 
phase resource tabulations using a declining cut-off grade strategy to 
maximize present value for an initial ore processing rate of 40,000 tpd,
 with an expansion to 80,000 tpd at the beginning of year 6. A 15-month 
preproduction stripping period, allowing for personnel and equipment 
ramp-ups, is contemplated to expose sufficient ore for initial 
concentrator operations. Haul road construction and clearing and 
grubbing of the pit area is expected to largely be performed by 
contractors prior to the commencement of preproduction stripping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed processing 
plant for Cangrejos is a conventional copper-gold flotation concentrator
 with a gravity circuit. It has been designed to treat 40,000 tpd (14.6 
million tonnes per annum (Mtpa)) of mineralized material during the 
first five years of operation and then be expanded to process 80,000 tpd
 (29.2 Mtpa) thereafter. Near-surface saprolite and saprock materials 
are not included in the current processing plan, as they respond poorly 
to the concentration processes. There is an opportunity to extract 
mineralization from approximately 10 million tonnes of this material 
with further metallurgical studies and modifications to the processing 
circuit, which is anticipated to be considered at the prefeasibility 
study stage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A trade-off study was 
conducted that compared SAG (semi-autogenous grinding) and ball mill 
grinding to high-pressure grinding rolls and ball mill grinding. For 
this PEA, an SAG and ball mill grinding circuit was selected after 
evaluating the difference between the relative operating and capital 
cost. The process flow sheet begins with a primary crusher adjacent to 
the pit and an overland conveyor to the plant. The plant consists of SAG
 and ball mills, gravity gold concentrators, copper and molybdenum 
concentration circuits and thickening and filtering for flotation 
tailings. The tailings are planned to be conveyed to the dry stack 
tailings facility. The plant is designed to produce a gravity gold 
concentrate, a copper-gold flotation concentrate and a molybdenum 
concentrate that will be trucked to an Ecuadorian port approximately 40 
kilometres away and shipped to smelters and refiners for further 
processing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Metallurgical recoveries and testwork summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent testwork (2015 to 
2018) was completed by C.H. Plenge &amp; CIA SA at its laboratory in 
Lima, Peru, using representative composites that confirmed the material 
from Cangrejos is amenable to a conventional crush, grind, gravity 
concentration and flotation flow sheet. The selected processing scheme 
produces separate saleable gravity gold, copper-gold and molybdenum 
concentrates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comminution tests 
indicate that the materials are hard and moderately abrasive. Fresh rock
 and oxide samples have bond ball mill work indices ranging from 14 
kilowatt-hours/tonne to 17 kwh/t and JKTech specific <b>energy</b> values averaging 12.3 kwh/t.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gravity concentration 
tests on fresh rock indicate that 37 per cent of the gold and 9 per cent
 of the silver can be recovered into a gravity gold concentrate. 
Lock-cycle flotation of fresh rock gravity tailings indicates that a 
bulk copper-gold-molybdenum concentrate with 21 per cent copper can be 
produced, under which copper, gold and molybdenum recoveries are 
projected to be 82 per cent, 45 per cent and 65 per cent, respectively. 
Overall gold recovery is projected to be 82 per cent (including both 
gravity concentration and flotation recovery methods). Final molybdenum 
recovery is projected at 50 per cent in the molybdenum concentrate. 
Flotation recoveries from saprolite and saprock materials were very low 
and did not produce a saleable flotation concentrate, driving the 
decision to treat the material as preproduction waste. Flotation of 
oxide material, however, resulted in a saleable flotation concentrate 
that assayed 16 per cent copper. It is projected that 65 per cent of the
 gold and 50 per cent of the copper will be recovered into the flotation
 concentrate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cyanidation tests on 
fresh rock recovered 92 per cent of the gold and 66 per cent of the 
silver. This processing method was not pursued as it does not recover 
copper or molybdenum.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dry stack tailings and waste rock storage facilities</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A siting and tailings 
disposal methodology study was performed for the PEA with the goal of 
balancing capital costs, operating costs and non-monetary considerations
 such as environmental and social impact. <span class="companylink">Ausenco</span>
 identified several potential sites and evaluated their suitability. The
 result of the study indicated that the best option for the project is a
 dry stack tailings facility (DSTF). This approach has a smaller 
footprint, positive environmental and social benefits, as well as 
reduced operating costs when compared with the other project wet 
tailings storage facility options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The DSTF is proposed to 
be located at the mine in close proximity to the plant site. This will 
allow for simple access for the overland conveyor from the plant to 
transport filtered tailings to the edge of the DSTF and then mobile 
conveyors and a radial stacking system will be used to place the 
tailings. As lifts are completed, it is planned that they will be 
progressively closed by grading the slopes and covering them with a 
growth media and revegetating them to reduce erosion and help stabilize 
the slopes. The facility area is approximately 240 hectares, which is 
expected to contain approximately 339 million tonnes of tailings, along 
with having significant future expansion potential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The waste rock storage 
facility (WRSF) for the project is proposed to be located in a closed 
drainage basin south of the open pit and will hold nearly 380 million 
tonnes of waste rock, saprolite and saprock according to the mine 
production schedule. The facility is planned to be constructed in 
20-metre lifts from the bottom up. To the extent possible, saprolite and
 saprock will be stored away from the toe areas of the WRSF and at 
higher elevations to facilitate capping the facility with growth media. 
As the facility dumping levels rise, lower slopes are expected to be 
regraded, covered with growth media and revegetated to reduce erosion 
and help stabilize the slopes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Geochemistry work to date
 indicates that both the DSTF and WRSF are unlikely to be acid 
generating based on results of acid-based accounting, paste pH testing 
and short-term leaching tests. The tailings and waste rock contain low 
sulphide concentrations and naturally occurring neutralizing minerals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Power infrastructure and water requirements</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Connected power 
requirements for the construction period, 40,000 tpd phase and 80,000 
tpd phase require 10 megawatts, 80 MW and 155 MW, respectively. Actual 
power draw, or demand, is approximately 70 per cent of the connected 
load. An Ecuadorian power supply consultant, EPTEC, has confirmed that 
there is sufficient capacity in the Ecuadorian National Electric 
Transmission System (NTS) to meet the requirements of the project. EPTEC
 recommended a connection point to the NTS at the new Avanzada 
substation planned for completion in 2021. Transmission to the project's
 main substation will consist of a single circuit 230-kilovolt 
transmission line over a distance of approximately 19 km. Construction 
period power supply is anticipated to be from diesel generation until 
the main substation and transmission line has been completed. A power 
cost of 6.3 cents per kWh has been used for the PEA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial work on 
hydrogeology and water balance has determined there will be adequate 
water for the project from on-site or nearby water sources, even in 
drought conditions. Water consumption is unlikely to impact local water 
users because the selection of a dry stack tailings alternative permits 
large-scale water reuse and recycling. Due to a high water level in the 
pit, pit dewatering will be required. The project is anticipated to have
 two separate groundwater management systems: in-pit dewatering sumps 
and horizontal borings to depressurize the pit slopes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employment and corporate social responsibility</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the construction 
period, the project is projected to hire approximately 530 full-time 
employees, which does not include outside contractors. Over the 16-year 
mine life it is expected that the project will employ approximately 600 
to 900 people depending on project's production phase. During production
 it is anticipated that approximately 50 employees will be dedicated to 
community, environmental, and health and safety work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lumina is committed to earning and maintaining a robust <b>social licence</b>
 to operate its Cangrejos mineral exploration and mine development 
operations in Ecuador. Community relations programs remain a continuing 
corporate priority. The project was designed to meet Ecuadorian 
environmental regulations, international mining industry best management
 practices and appropriate international lending institution guidelines.
 As such, significant human and financial resources have been factored 
into the PEA to meet environmental obligations and social commitments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taxes applied in the economic model</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The PEA incorporates a 
5-per-cent net smelter royalty (NSR) payable to the Ecuadorian 
government, 15-per-cent profit-sharing tax (12 per cent in state and 3 
per cent in employee), 22-per-cent corporate tax, and several other 
local and municipal taxes. Lumina is not currently making an assumption 
for the prepayment of a portion of the 5-per-cent NSR as this will not 
be negotiated with the government until post a prefeasibility study. No 
sovereign adjustment payment was deemed necessary for inclusion in the 
PEA. The Ecuadorian windfall tax does not apply to the project under the
 commodity price scenarios that are utilized in the PEA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next steps at Cangrejos</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lumina plans to continue 
its current infill, stepout and depth extension drilling program at 
Cangrejos to further delineate open areas to the south, north, west and 
at depth. Following the completion of this program, Lumina expects to 
advance the project to a prefeasibility study.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was disappointing, but
 not unexpected, to read NDP Environment Minister Shannon Phillips's 
brazen defence of the NDP's carbon tax in these pages this past Saturday
 ("On climate change, Albertans expect their leaders to lead", June 23, 
2018).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP's carbon tax was always just a government cash grab - one that comes with considerable expense to Albertans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the NDP minister 
talks about "the interests of everyday Alberta families" in her column, 
the reality is that the "the interests of everyday Alberta families" are
 a lot more expensive with the carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From heightened costs for
 schools to keep the lights on, to Albertans facing an added cost at the
 pumps on top of an already high fuel cost just for the crime of getting
 to work or driving for groceries, the carbon tax affects everybody in 
Alberta. Ms. Phillips claimed that the carbon tax is needed "to secure 
future growth and market access through new pipelines."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the NDP sprung their surprise carbon tax on Albertans, not one pipeline opponent has moved from "No" to "Yes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's what has happened: the federal Liberal government stopped the Northern Gateway pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They tampered with the regulatory process and stopped the <b>Energy</b> East pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The previous U.S. administration halted the Keystone XL pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, of course, British 
Columbia's NDP government has been fighting tooth and nail to stop the 
Trans Mountain Expansion Project, a much-needed, job-creating project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, extreme activist groups remain determined to illegally obstruct the Trans Mountain expansion project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of these groups or governments received the memo about the carbon tax and <b>social licence</b>, apparently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are the NDP's 
fellow travellers obstructing the pipeline: including some of those 
organizing illegal protests, Tzeporah Berman and Karen Mahon, who 
Alberta's NDP government actually named to their oilsands advisory 
group; or <span class="companylink">Greenpeace</span> ringleader Mike Hudema, with whom Minister Phillips collaborated on a how-to book on stopping resource projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In her column, the NDP minister did find room to attribute Calgary's Green Line LRT to the carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She fails to mention that
 federal funding for the Green Line LRT came under the former federal 
Conservative government, announced by Jason Kenney in mid-2015, and 
there was no condition of a carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP's carbon tax, 
from the start, has been a false bag of goods: they never campaigned on 
it, they just imposed it right after taking office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2015, the premier 
claimed that revenue collected through the carbon tax would never go to 
pad the government's deficit-heavy budgets, but that's exactly where 
it's going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As time passes, the only 
defence the NDP seems to have for their carbon tax cash grab is to try 
and guilt Albertans into supporting it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've said it before and 
I'll say it again: I know that Albertans are smarter than that, and I 
know they do not believe for a minute that the only way to address 
climate change is through a carbon tax.</p>

named Trudeau happen to be prime minister, or is it possible there's 
more to it than that? You'd have a hard time convincing many Albertans 
that Justin Trudeau is any sort of improvement over his deeply disliked 
father. The Trudeau Liberals'epic mishandling of the pipeline crisis - 
which wasn't really a crisis until they turned it into one - already had
 backs up across the province when Albertans discovered they'd been 
hoodwinked by a surprise federal move to cement the widelydisliked 
equalization program in place for another five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don Braid, the veteran 
Calgary Herald columnist not usually prone to hyperbole, reflected the 
depth of the resulting anger when he wrote that the move indicates 
"Canada is rigged."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Rarely has there been a 
sneakier ploy than the Trudeau government's unilateral renewal of the 
current equalization system without formal notice to provinces or the 
public," Braid wrote. "Everybody involved looks either secretive or 
stupid. Except the feds, who are just sneaky, all in the traditional 
interest of refusing to change a system rigged against Alberta."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's anger is 
understandable. It has endured five years of deeply trying times as oil 
prices collapsed, gutting its economy, with Ottawa offering little 
beyond words in assistance. But western grievances aren't limited to a 
province that rarely welcomes Liberals in any case. Trudeau's government
 is at loggerheads with British Columbia over the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 pipeline mess, heading to a confrontation with Saskatchewan over 
Ottawa's carbon tax dictates, and facing a return to the days when you 
could fly from Ontario's border to the Pacific without crossing more 
than a handful of Liberal outposts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's notable about the 
situation is how comprehensively the Liberals have created the problems 
for themselves. If Trudeau and his top honchos had deliberately set out 
to create a pipeline problem, they couldn't have done any better. 
Trudeau claimed to support the Keystone XL project in the U.S. but paid 
little beyond lip service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When President Barack 
Obama killed it, he offered barely a murmur of complaint, noting he was 
"disappointed ... but respect(s) the right of the United States to make 
the decision." The Liberals blocked Northern Gateway, introduced a 
regulatory regime certain to confound future projects, watched <b>Energy</b> East die, and all but issued a veto to anti-oil activists by jabbering blithely about the importance of "<b>social licence</b>," a term you don't often hear from the embattled prime minister anymore. Ottawa only got serious about <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 when the company forced the issue; now Canadians are stuck with the 
costs, and a B.C. government that's just as adamant as ever about 
ensuring it never gets built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While fumbling that file,
 the Liberals'determination to impose a national carbon plan is showing 
every sign of backfiring. B.C.'s New Democrats have turned that 
province's existing tax into a straightforward money grab, making a 
prophet of every critic who claimed governments, no matter how 
well-meaning, would twist the plan into just another way to collect and 
spend money. By this time next year Ottawa could face premiers united 
from Ontario west in opposition to the federal scheme and willing to go 
to the mat to block it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One would think that, 
with those fissures already in place, Ottawa would be wary about opening
 another against western interests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But no. Buried deep - 
very deep - in the fine print of the latest Liberal budget was a 
paragraph indicating equalization would be extended for five years until
 2024. It was oddly worded, didn't show up until page 319 of a 369-page 
document, and evidently slipped past provincial leaders and others 
assigned to decipher Ottawa's intentions. Despite knowing both 
Saskatchewan and Alberta were preparing to argue for substantial changes
 before the program could be renewed, no consultations were offered and 
no apparent efforts made to flag the decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finance Minister Bill 
Morneau's office did write to both provinces referring to the renewal 
after the budget had already been introduced, but in terms that somehow 
failed to trigger alarm in either case. He did offer to consult on the 
next renewal, in five years, if he's still in office and the Liberals 
still in power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, technically, Ottawa 
can say its action wasn't totally secret, though considering the 
delicacy of the issue and the importance to the provinces, its handling 
was decidedly curious. In any case, slipping a fast one past a couple of
 finance ministers wasn't going to prevent the eventual outburst when 
the ruse got noticed. If anything, it was only bound to worsen the 
situation by shredding what little trust remained between western 
leaders and federal officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why do it? Are Trudeau
 and Morneau entirely tone-deaf to the West? It's not an outlandish 
suggestion. Morneau may have a respectable business record, but his 
judgment was put in serious question by last year's business tax reform 
shambles, and his personal background is rooted deeply in Ontario's 
Toronto-centric Liberal traditions. Trudeau's B.C. ties date from his 
youth as a freewheeling snowboarder and his brief teaching career; as a 
politician he's decidedly central Canadian in aspect. Of his 184 seats, 
120 are in Ontario and Quebec. He needs to perform well there next year 
to keep his job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equalization is a complex
 program that is easily misunderstood, but the fact that almost $12 
billion of its $19 billion goes to Quebec - a province that never 
hesitates to boast about its advanced nature while somehow eternally 
qualifying as a "have-not" entity - is a matter of justifiable 
frustration, especially in provinces like Alberta and Saskatchewan that 
find their resource-based economies condemn them to second-tier status, 
even in tough times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They wanted to discuss 
the program and propose some changes. Ottawa undercut them in a devious 
manner. Is it something in the Trudeau gene pool? Or just a Liberal 
party that has always struggled to see past Ontario? National Post

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto's 'tiny perfect 
mayor', David Crombie, came to Barrie on 17 April. He was here as the 
opening speaker in Third Age Barrie's (TAB) five-part spring series 
titled "City Futures: Facing the Big Issues".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The series was proposed 
to TAB a year ago by Jeff Lehman, Mayor of Barrie, who also arranged for
 all five speakers. In addition to Crombie, these included Anne Golden, 
Director, Ryerson City Building Institute, Mike Moffat, chief economist 
of the Mowat Centre, Brian Bentz, CEO of Alectra Inc., and Lehman 
himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman took a few minutes
 to introduce the series to our audience and then our speaker got down 
to business. Crombie's discourse, "Immediate vs. Long Term", was replete
 with anecdotes, humour and words of wisdom about urban concerns. He 
emphasized the need for community interaction and mutual cooperation, 
not only among individuals who live in a community but also between 
municipal, provincial and federal government agencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He noted that we often 
fail to recognize the extent of our reliance on government services 
(e.g. transport, roads, schools, health care, social services), and that
 cuts in financial support for such services merely guarantees that much
 more substantial spending will be necessary in the future: Toronto's 
city transit served as his case in point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about the apparent 
diminishing role of the family in community life, Crombie demurred and 
suggested that the notion of family had changed over time and now 
includes many more people than merely blood relatives. We now speak of 
inclusion rather than integration, he said, thereby broadening our 
perspective on what a community entails. In response to other queries he
 talked about the need to seek the "vital middle" in disputes where 
there are reasoned arguments on all sides, and also not to be trapped by
 current "<b>social licence</b>" (popular support) requirements which may be catered to for the wrong reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Moffat's lecture on 
'The Sharing Economy" left us with much to think about, especially in 
connection with adjustments we must make if we hope to successfully 
manage the economy of the future. Moffat compared the circumstance and 
characteristics of our work habits in 1977, 2018 and 2059, noting that 
the greatest changes developing in the area of automation and robot use,
 i.e. our evolving ability to produce as much, with better quality, with
 far fewer workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using the examples of Uber, <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span>, the <span class="companylink">Alibaba Group</span>
 and other platform businesses, where huge amounts of cash is generated 
by companies that own few infrastructure assets other than apps, have 
few employees, offer no benefits and have little need to re-invest after
 initial outlay, he showed how employment will drop and the downward 
pressure on wages will follow. Much to think about indeed!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third talk, by Anne 
Golden on "Cities and Social Challenges", took up some of the same 
themes addressed by Moffatt. Using urban development in Toronto as her 
model, she focused on the rapidly growing wealth inequality and the 
problems it causes for society at large. Illustrating by use of urban 
maps how Toronto has become ghettoized by income levels since 1980, with
 the very wealthy occupying some parts of the city and the poor other 
parts, with very little place left for the middle class that used to 
dominate the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to its moral 
implications for the worse, widening inequalities are bad for the 
economy, she said, while providing six general spheres from which we 
might find solutions to the dilemma: 1) higher education, though its 
mission would have to be adjusted to fit the needs of an automated work 
world; 2) vocational training; 3) the labour market, in which the role 
of unions need reconsideration, and practices such as a minimum wage 
debated; 4) the tax system; 5) social programmes - with social attention
 to affordable housing; and 6) enlightened urban planning, with a 
commitment to get rid of auto dependence and improve public transit. It 
was clear from this presentation that if we didn't alter our thinking 
about cities, our next generation could find itself in serious 
difficulties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next came Brian Bentz to speak on "Innovative <b>Energy</b>
 Strategies". Focusing on the electricity industry in Ontario, he 
outlined his own 20-year career working in Barrie as an auditor for 
power companies before moving on to bigger and better things. Now the 
CEO of Alectra, the second largest community-owned utility in North 
America, Bentz described both the history and innovative future of 
electricity use in Ontario. In keeping with earlier speakers, he made it
 plain that the future lay with full automation of all our electricity 
needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently the Ontario 
grid is decarbonized (coal plants gone) and the province is a leader in 
the use of smart metres. Bentz foresees his business transforming from a
 manager of <b>energy</b> distribution to an Internet manager, with such advantages as smart batteries for solar <b>energy</b>,
 and perhaps even a grid capable of repairing itself. Alectra's mantra 
is "Discover the Possibilities", many of which he enumerated here. Not 
surprisingly, the question period was especially lively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The series concluded on 
15 May with an address by Jeff Lehman, Mayor of Barrie, under the rubric
 "Urban Sprawl - Is It Sustainable?" Using Barrie as his main example, 
he outlined the most pressing issues facing municipal government and how
 to best deal with them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman struck a more an 
optimistic cord than some of the previous speakers, especially on the 
crucial issue of housing. Mixed housing construction (single dwellings, 
apartments, condos, affordable housing) co-exist well, complementing 
each other, he said. Higher density development, inner courtyards for 
condos and apartment buildings, and innovative transportation techniques
 may provide solutions to many of the concerns raised throughout the 
series. With a mayoralty election looming, it is not surprising that 
there were many questions from the floor, all answered informatively 
and, most importantly, frankly by Jeff Lehman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the "big issues" 
revealed by our speakers are coming realities for which we are not yet 
prepared. But awareness is essential if the old motto, "be prepared", is
 to have purpose. The series on "City Futures" has certainly left us 
aware.</p>
<p>Barrie Mayor Jeff Lehman arranged for  the five speakers for the "City Futures: Facing Big Issues" seminar.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP is at it again. 
This time, pedalling the false notion that a rejection of their carbon 
tax agenda is equal to a rejection of science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These worn out talking points came last week from Steve Williams, president and CEO of Suncor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking at an event in 
Calgary, Williams stated that "the science of the left wing is different
 that the science of the right wing," and blamed conservatives for 
dividing the public on the issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some wealthy CEOs might 
criticize us for rejecting the NDP's carbon tax, but we are on side with
 the vast majority of Albertans who are forced to bear the costs of this
 government's policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Albertans who don't 
appreciate being shamed by elites who have no trouble making ends meet 
for rejecting a policy that has wreaked havoc on household budgets 
across the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Poll after poll shows 
just how unpopular this carbon tax is, and with good reason - it hasn't 
done a thing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, it simply 
punishes Alberta consumers by increasing the cost of everything from 
heating our homes in the winter to putting gas in the vehicle that gets 
us to work each day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What it has done is drive
 emissions, along with good, mortgage-paying jobs, to jurisdictions 
without a punitive carbon tax regime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We already see <b>energy</b> jobs booming in places like North Dakota and Texas, while the oil and gas workers in Alberta remain unemployed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact of the matter is
 that Albertans were sold a false bill of goods when the NDP introduced 
its carbon tax - a tax they never campaigned on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were told that it would buy us the so-called "<b>social licence</b>" we needed to get shovels in the ground on a pipeline to tidewater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not one pipeline 
oppo-nent has become a pipeline supporter as a result of this carbon tax
 and the Trans Mountain pipeline project now hangs in the balance, 
despite the fact that taxpayers have now assumed the financial risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These opponents - the 
same ones the NDP promised would become supporters if we handcuffed our 
economy with a punitive tax on everything - are now doing everything in 
their power to block Trans Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are the elected 
officials in British Columbia that are denying permits and bringing 
progress to a standstill with an endless stream of court challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are the so-called "activists", funded by foreign anti-Alberta interests, that are illegally blocking construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not one of these opponents has been swayed by the Alberta NDP's carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, they are digging their heels in for the long haul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, rather than admit it 
was wrong, the NDP has chosen to smear every Albertan opposed to the 
carbon tax as a climate change 'denier,'a phrase deliberately intended 
to invoke Holocaust denial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone that dares challenge this government on the false logic of "<b>social licence</b>" or raise a question about carbon leakage is branded as backwards and anti-science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, I know that 
Albertans are smarter than that, and I know they do not believe for a 
minute that the only way to address climate change is through a carbon 
tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP would be wise to remember this the next time they feel an urge to insult the people they are supposed to represent.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About a 10-hour drive northwest of Toronto, in an area with no history of mining and little exploration, <span class="companylink">Goldcorp Inc</span>.
 is tunnelling a hole, currently at least 120 metres below the pine tree
 forests and lakes that dot the surface, for what it hopes will be one 
of its most sustainable mines yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borden, as the mine is to
 be called when it starts producing in 2019, will be modest in size at 
about 250,000 ounces of gold per year under current estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But <span class="companylink">Goldcorp</span>
 harbours big ambitions to make it the first all-electric underground 
mine in Canada where everything from the trucks that haul ore, to the 
ventilation system that provides oxygen to its subterranean workers, run
 off <b>energy</b> taken from the electrical grid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All mines are finite 
projects, making them in one sense, unsustainable. Still, in an era when
 countries around the world have pledged to curb carbon emissions, many 
mining companies are citing "sustainability" as a core value and are 
making strides to limit their environmental impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Barrick Gold</span>, <span class="companylink">Endeavour Silver Corp</span>.
 and other companies released reports in the past month that sought to 
measure their "sustainability" by looking at environmental impacts, 
community relations, safety records and other metrics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With diesel prices rising
 in tandem with oil prices, the quest for sustainability also has pushed
 many companies to look closely at their <b>energy</b> usage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not just 
necessarily because of the environment," said Brent Bergeron, Goldcorp's
 executive vice-president of corporate affairs and sustainability. 
"There's very interesting financial benefits we can get by actually 
becoming smarter about how we produce and use power generation at our 
sites."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In choosing a mine to 
experiment with how to wean itself off diesel, the Borden project made 
sense, he said, because of its small size and its location in Ontario, 
where a cap-and-trade program came into effect earlier this year. The 
program sets a limit on a company's greenhouse gas emissions, above 
which they need to purchase credits at auctions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although electricity is expensive in Ontario, Bergeron said there is access to renewable <b>energy</b> sources such as hydro, which will lower the company's carbon footprint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside the mine itself, it is also using electric-powered 40-tonne haul trucks, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Those trucks don't exist
 yet," Bergeron said, adding that the company urged the supplier to 
build them or else the company would find a different supplier that 
could build them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also obvious benefits to switching to the grid. By using electricity for its air ventilation system, <span class="companylink">Goldcorp</span> stopped spewing diesel particulate into the air it must keep clean for its workers, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think that what you're
 seeing today is mining companies trying to really push the 
sustainability side of what we're doing," said Bergeron, "but also look 
at it from the point of view of these technologies do exist, they have 
been proven, so let's try and get them into some of our projects."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other companies cited 
additional benefits of moving their mines off diesel and onto the grid 
completely unrelated to the environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Pan American Silver Corp</span>., which 
recently released a report on its sustainability, built a 98-kilometre 
power line to connect its open pit silver gold Dolores mine in Mexico to
 the national power grid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Constructed in late 2016 
at a cost of $20 million, it has resulted in savings of about $9 million
 per year, according to spokeswoman Siren Fisekci.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located in an area of 
Mexico that has been riven by violence, possibly linked to drug cartels,
 last month, the mine temporarily closed after a decapitated body was 
found on a road near the mine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When we bring supplies 
in there, you're looking at 120 to 140 kilometre road to bring them in 
there," said Fisekci, who added that the power line allows the mine to 
operate regardless of conditions on the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some mining companies say <b>energy</b> accounts for 10 per cent of operating costs at a mine, which is inducement enough to look for savings through renewable <b>energy</b> or otherwise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, on another 
continent, amid the dusty, semi-arid landscape of northern Namibia in 
southern Africa, executives from Vancouver-based B2Gold Corp. stood with
 local dignitaries in early June to ring in the opening of a seven 
megawatt solar panel plant it built to help power its nearby open pit 
gold mine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built at a cost of $8.5 million, it is expected to help the company save about 13 per cent on its <b>energy</b> usage at the open pit per year - about $16.5 million over the next decade or so, according to the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Bill Lytle, senior vice-president of operations for <span class="companylink">B2Gold</span>,
 acknowledged that the open pit mine would "scar the earth," but also 
noted that the mine had an estimated lifespan of about 10 years, 
depending on whether there is future exploration and other factors. 
Regardless, at the end of the mine life, the plan is to fill the pit 
with water and make it into a lake, then convert the surrounding area 
into a nature reserve, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the solar plant has a lifespan of 25 years, meaning it could outlast the mine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think all mining 
companies will tell you to some degree they're doing some sort of 
sustainability," said Lytle. "It is a requirement to maintain your <b>social licence</b> to operate."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today marks two years 
since the Alberta NDP's carbon tax bill became law, and the United 
Conservatives are vowing to make this the last year that Albertans will 
have to pay the carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Should Albertans elect 
us next year, today marks the last year that Albertans will have to pay 
the NDP carbon tax," United Conservative leader Jason Kenney said. "Next
 summer, we will introduce Bill 1: the Carbon Tax Repeal Act, putting an
 end to a punitive tax that makes it more expensive for Albertans to 
heat their homes and drive to work."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the NDP imposed 
this punishing tax, the carbon tax has done nothing more than make life 
more expensive for everyday Albertans: School boards: the Calgary Board 
of Education is faced with carbon tax costs of $3 million and counting 
each year, while kindergarten programs are being scrapped to make up for
 the shortfall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Non-profit groups: the

could make the difference between staying open and shutting down.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Canada's not even on the radar screen anymore."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to tens of billions of dollars of potential international investment in <b>energy</b>
 projects, "Canada's not even on the radar screen anymore." That's the 
bleak assessment of Rafi Tahmazian, portfolio manager at Canoe 
Financial, as told to reporters earlier this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They don't even care," 
Tahmazian said of the big oil companies and international fund managers 
who are avoiding Canada and Alberta like the plague.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tahmazian's own billion-dollar portfolio used to be invested just 30 per cent outside Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now fully 60 per cent of the assets he manages are in foreign markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is seen as too unpredictable and too hostile to business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In just three years in 
office, the added taxes, regulations and environmental evangelizing of 
the federal Liberal and provincial New Democrat governments have scared 
away as much as $100 billion in economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, some of the loss 
was due to the collapse in world oil prices in 2014 and 2015. But other 
jurisdictions that were hit with the same collapse have begun to recover
 far faster than Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil-producing states in 
the U.S. are mostly at or above pre-collapse investment and production 
levels, for instance. Meanwhile, according to <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span>, foreign investment in Canada's <b>energy</b> sector dropped by another $30 billion last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2017, when most oil-producing regions of the world were getting back to business, Canada and Alberta saw <span class="companylink">Shell</span>, <span class="companylink">ConocoPhillips</span>, Statoil and Total pull out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, of course, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 effectively pulled out, too. It only doesn't look like they pulled out 
because Ottawa rushed in with $4.5 billion in taxpayer dollars to keep 
up the appearance that the Trans Mountain Expansion project is still a 
viable concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And this week, the <span class="companylink">Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) </span>released a report estimating that over the next 10 years, complying with environmental regulations will drive up Canadian <b>energy</b> companies'costs by another $25 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's $25 billion that 
could have gone into job creation and contracts for smaller service 
companies, equipment purchases, building construction, exploration or 
shareholders' dividends. Instead, it will go to meeting the demands of 
bureaucrats, government regulators and environmental lobbyists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is on top of an 
April report from Scotiabank showing that the lack of pipelines to get 
Canadian oil to ocean-going ports is costing <b>energy</b> companies and governments $15 billion a year in lost sales and revenues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is it any wonder that Suncor CEO Steve Williams told The <span class="companylink">Canadian Press</span> this week that despite Ottawa's buyout of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>,
 his company is no more likely to invest in big projects in Canada than 
before the buyout? "Canada is falling behind other jurisdictions in 
terms of competitiveness when it comes to government royalties, taxation
 and confidence in the regulatory system," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Into this gloomy economic picture trots the <span class="companylink">University of Alberta</span>, which Thursday awarded an honorary degree to infamous eco-activist and oilsands detractor, David Suzuki.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two things are related.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of Alberta's and 
Canada's "progressive" politicians have fallen under the spell of 
"green" activists like Suzuki. They have established policies that are 
destroying investor confidence in our <b>energy</b> sector in the name of saving the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would you invest in a high-cost, high-risk <b>energy</b>
 project when the federal government is trying to make pipeline approval
 contingent on gender studies and traditional Indigenous knowledge, as 
much as scientific research? Would you invest when the Alberta 
government wants to add billions in carbon tax to buy "<b>social licence</b>"
 from environmental extremists - licence the extremists will never 
grant? The "green" mentality that has seized our politics (and of which 
Suzuki is a high-profile representative) is exactly what is making 
Canada so utterly unattractive to investors, despite having the 
third-largest oil reserves in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's like living a nightmare.</p>

</div><div>944 words</div><div>7 June 2018</div><div>The Daily Oil Bulletin</div><div>DOILB</div><div>English</div><div>(c)2018 copyright Junewarren-Nickle’s Energy Group. All rights reserved </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is scepticism at the head office of one of the world’s biggest <b>energy</b> companies about whether Canada can build megaprojects on time and on budget, says a Canadian representative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corporation</span>
 (Sinopec), which bills itself as the world’s biggest refiner and 
second-biggest petrochemical producer, was one of China’s big three 
state-owned <b>energy</b> companies that invested in Canada’s oil and gas industry this century. The others are <span class="companylink">China National Offshore Oil Corporation</span> (<span class="companylink">CNOOC</span>) and <span class="companylink">PetroChina</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, though, neither has attempted to build any multibillion-dollar projects here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Brian Tuffs, CEO of Sinopec Canada, took part in a panel discussion at a
 Gas Processing Association of Canada (GPAC) lunch on Wednesday. The 
subject was Canada’s natural gas future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuffs, who often travels 
to Sinopec’s Beijing office, responded to a questions about Canada’s 
competitiveness and ability to build major <b>energy</b> projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When I look at Beijing 
... they’re very much in a wait-and-see attitude,” he said, referring to
 perceptions about Canada’s ability to built projects — especially 
megaprojects — on time and on budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Until we actually get 
something committed, and get something completed, I think there is a lot
 of scepticism about Canada’s ability to actually execute on a project,”
 Tuffs told the well-attended Calgary event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to Canadian competitiveness, Tuffs has a fairly unique perspective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sinopec, which has about 
800,000 employees, is active in 26 countries. So Sinopec Canada’s 
proposed capital projects have to compete internally for funding against
 projects around the world. (He said Sinopec’s Canadian production is 
about 60,000-65,000 boe/d, roughly half gas and half oil.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I would say, speaking as
 a CEO of an entity that competes with 26 other countries for funding 
[within Sinopec], that we in Canada struggle to compete [for] capital,” 
Tuffs told the GPAC event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He sought “to dispel any 
lingering myths” about the Chinese government’s commercial priorities, 
arguing that making money doesn’t take a back seat to shipping physical 
barrels to China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our single most 
important corporate target is net free cash flow,” he said. “We want to 
have more money coming in than every last dollar that goes out. And if 
we’re successful, then that’s how we do it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When I talk to the big 
guys over in Beijing, they’ll say, ‘Look Brian, we don’t need 
necessarily for you to provide barrels to China. Make us money. If we 
have money, the world will sell us [oil].’”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: “We operate on a
 100 per cent commercial basis. And we compete internationally against 
all those other international projects.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuffs has witnessed 
China’s fast-paced conversion to natural gas as the government strives 
to improve notoriously bad air quality in cities such as Beijing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He believes Canada, with its vast gas resources and tiny domestic demand, has a “tremendous opportunity.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have a federal 
government which, broadly speaking, would like to build stronger trade 
relations with countries such as China. We share a common Pacific 
coastline with Southeast Asia. So we should be the favoured supplier of 
natural gas to those new markets.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it has to be able to compete on cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think, though, when we look at competitiveness, it’s not just about getting a <b>social licence</b> to do our work. It’s about having a cost structure which is competitive,” Tuffs said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“At the moment, when we 
look at our markets, our traditional market in the Lower 48. ... We’re 
at the wrong end of the pipeline to supply the U.S. We’re competing 
against gas from Texas [and] Louisiana.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in global gas 
markets, Canada’s first LNG export project will have to compete with 
expansions at existing LNG projects — and brownfield projects have a 
cost advantage over greenfield projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There’s no premium that a
 buyer is going to pay for a methane molecule that comes from Canada. 
They’re not going to pay extra because we’ve got a little Maple Leaf or a
 polar bear on our methane,” Tuffs said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What the international 
markets care about is cost and reliability of supply. And those are the 
only two things that as a buyer of LNG, [including] Sinopec, cares 
about. How cheap can I get it? And how reliable is the source?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Energy</b> costs are 
especially important to China because this key input affects the supply 
costs of the country’s entire industrial chain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If their <b>energy</b> 
costs go too high, then their manufacturing cost becomes too high, and 
they become uncompetitive,” Tuffs said. “And [if] the economy of China 
stalls, [it] has implications ... for the global economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So we need to look at the competitiveness of our cost structure as well as actually getting a <b>social licence</b>.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Susannah Pierce, external relations director of the proposed Kitimat, 
B.C. LNG Canada export project, also stressed the importance of being 
able to compete on cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Royal Dutch Shell plc</span>-led project, which is expected to decide this year on whether to proceed, would be built from scratch at a greenfield site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Most of the other parts 
of the world where we’re competing already have a lot of capital 
infrastructure in the ground,” Pierce told the GPAC lunch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She emphasized the LNG industry is extremely capital intensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are dealing with 
competitors — whether that be the U.S. Gulf Coast [or] Australia [or] 
Qatar — which really are all about expansion. And as we know, expansions
 are less capital intensive, for the most part.”</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">What Trudeau could do to prevent another Trans Mountain debacle - but isn't</span>
</div><div class="author">Special to Financial Post </div><div>639 words</div><div>7 June 2018</div><div>Postmedia Breaking News</div><div>CWNS</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2018 Postmedia Breaking News </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government's 
promise to buy the Trans Mountain pipeline was not ideal, but it was 
preferable to a total breakdown of the project. Nationalization was the 
federal government's last remaining market-access option for Canadian 
oilsands entirely within its own jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That the Trudeau 
government was compelled to resort to this option is a testament to the 
dysfunction of our approval processes for major hydrocarbon 
infrastructure. A project that had all of the requisite regulatory 
approvals and had not to date suffered any substantive reversal in the 
courts was nevertheless deemed by its private capital investors as too 
risky to try completing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless of whether 
Trans Mountain is actually completed, as the Trudeau government 
promises, and eventually sold to private-sector interests, as it also 
vows to do, the question for reasonable Canadians is what we've learned 
from this outcome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most important lesson
 would be the necessity to restore confidence that regulatory approvals 
in Canada actually mean something. Governments must demonstrate their 
preparedness to resolutely thwart any civil disobedience intended solely
 to obstruct approved infrastructure, to remove legislatively any 
ambiguities on the primacy of federal jurisdiction and to clarify 
legislatively what constitutes adequate consultation with impacted 
stakeholders. This would reduce the claims of inadequate consultation 
that too many courts feel compelled to give credence to long after 
regulatory decisions have been rendered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, the regulatory process does not need more process for its own sake, as the proposed Bill C-69, which overhauls the <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span>'s
 traditional role, would impose. Instead, Canada needs to restore the 
regulatory process to be primarily a technocratic exercise focused on 
the construction and operation of infrastructure to ensure that 
legitimate stakeholder and environment impacts are mitigated or 
financially accommodated to reasonable global standards. The process 
must be governed by accepted legal standards for standing and the 
probative value of submitted evidence. It cannot be a consensus 
exercise; its function should not be to make policy. Policy 
clarifications should be provided by democratically elected governments 
before the fact, so that the ambiguity of whether a project is in the 
public interest is determined as much as possible early on. Bill C-69 is
 at odds with what would substantively restore investor confidence in 
the regulatory process. The government should stand down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Third, the federal 
government needs to fundamentally clarify its national carbon policy. To
 its credit, it has tried to espouse some balance between what it would 
see as credible climate policy and tolerance for hydrocarbon. It has 
imposed a national pricing standard that is as stringent as any 
currently in place among any of its major trading partners. But it has 
failed to explain that its national carbon-reduction targets are only an
 aspiration, at best, not an inviolate obligation that requires 
constraining growth in hydrocarbon production. That failure has 
emboldened the Canadian environmental movement to resist all hydrocarbon
 infrastructure, contributing to rendering our regulatory approval 
process dysfunctional. The Trudeau government should immediately clarify
 that carbon taxes are the pre-eminent carbon-policy instrument for 
Canada. Paying for carbon is a licence to emit. There is no other "<b>social licence</b>" standard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada cannot afford to 
lose its most economic opportunities to regulatory and political 
failure. We have come perilously close to doing that, leaving the fate 
of so many of our <b>energy</b> project developments uncertain. Prime 
Minister Justin Trudeau in the past castigated the previous government 
for acting as "cheerleaders, not referees" who are "putting their hands 
on the scale" to promote hydrocarbon development. By nationalizing Trans
 Mountain, Trudeau's government has now gone well beyond anything he 
could accuse them of doing. It cannot happen again.</p>

<span class="companylink">Questerre <b>Energy</b> Corp</span>. has

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, president and chief executive officer of Questerre, 
commented: "On closing, we will gain operatorship of our acreage in the

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pursuant to the LOI, 
Questerre will acquire the exploration rights to 753,000 net acres in

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trudeau government's decision to spend $4.5 billion to acquire the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline must be a wake-up call for Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a sign that we've gone too far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consultations and regulatory processes have become disconnected from their initial purposes of informed decision-making.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Project approvals and 
permitting are regularly subjected to lengthy delays and costly 
uncertainty that have nothing to do with the environment, science, or 
our economic interests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've enfeebled our economy as a result. The case of the Trans Mountain pipeline should bring this into stark clarity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A private company wanted 
to invest $7.5 billion - more than half the federal government's annual 
infrastructure budget - in our country's <b>energy</b> infrastructure. It represented a substantial investment involving 15,000 construction jobs alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company, by all accounts, followed the rules. It submitted a project application at the end of 2013. The <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span>
 recommended its approval in May 2016. The government accepted the 
recommendation - including 157 conditions - in November 2016. <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> spent $1 billion going through the painstaking consultation and regulatory process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet in spite of all 
this, the company ultimately decided the project wasn't viable due to 
ongoing policy and legal uncertainty. No other firm would touch it. 
Ottawa had no choice but to buy it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How did we get to a point
 where a private company that abided by the process and sought to invest
 billions of dollars in our country was precluded from doing so? How did
 we get to a point where public capital needed to replace private 
capital to finance a profitable project? This isn't a nascent industry. 
It isn't a case of market failure. We already have 840,000 km of 
pipeline operating in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most has been financed and constructed by private capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a case of government failure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, it's a failure 
by all of us. We've permitted a build up of government rules and 
processes that amounts to what conservative columnist George Will calls 
"economic enfeeblement."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trudeau government 
certainly contributed to the problem. Opportunistic critiques of the 
major project review process diminished public confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vague commitments about 
the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People raised
 the spectre of a First Nations "veto". New regulatory burdens 
exacerbated the already slow and cumbersome process. Notions of "<b>social licence</b>" were predictably used as a foil by ideological activists to stall progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is all true. But the
 problem is bigger than one government, one pipeline, or one sector. It 
now permeates every level of government and crosses the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One example: Condo and 
real estate developers in Toronto typically face nearly a 
year-and-a-half for approvals and spend an average of $46,570 per unit 
on compliance costs. The result is less housing supply and in turn 
higher prices at a time when people are rightly concerned about housing 
affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another example: federal,
 provincial, and local governments pledged funding for the Spadina 
subway extension in 2006 and yet the service only commenced more than 10
 years later in December 2017 following various delays and cost 
overruns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No wonder it represented the first new subway stops in decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The list could go on and on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trans Mountain episode is merely the most recent and highest profile example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It should cause us to restore common sense to government decision-making and project reviews.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's time to end the enfeeblement. We need to start building things again.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executive Fellow at the School of Public Policy at the University of Calgary and a former minister of finance and <b>energy</b> in the government of Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's decision to buy out <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s
 pipeline interest is best understood as making the best of a very bad 
situation, but a situation that he is responsible for creating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's be clear: A federally owned pipeline is hardly what anyone wanted. But it's better than no pipeline at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost all growth in 
global oil demand in the next 20 years – and it's big, a 30-per-cent 
increase – will be in Asia. New access to export markets other than the 
United States is critical if Canada is to stop selling our oil at huge 
discounts. It's time to keep that money here – along with the private 
sector jobs and government revenues that it creates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.C. Premier John Horgan's death-by-delay strategy was working against <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 because for a private company, time is money – their money. But it 
won't work against Ottawa. Ottawa has lots of time and lots of money – 
other people's money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals' hope is 
that the futility of further delaying tactics will be so obvious that 
the B.C. government will abandon their rope-a-dope strategy. Or if they 
don't, one or two defections and/or several recall elections will force 
Mr. Horgan's minority government into a non-confidence vote and a new 
election sooner rather than later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But beyond that, there's 
nothing positive about Tuesday's announcement. It was an 11th-hour 
government bailout of a privately funded pipeline project that had met 
all the requirements for approval. Will that inspire investor confidence
 going forward? Hardly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How was the $4.5-billion 
purchase price arrived at? With Mr. Trudeau – or his emissary, the poor 
Finance Minister Bill Morneau – on his knees in Houston, begging. By 
April of this year, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> 
understood that Mr. Trudeau and Canada needed the Trans Mountain 
expansion much more than they did. The Prime Minister had 
single-handedly destroyed all of Canada's other options to reach new 
export markets – first Northern Gateway, then <b>Energy</b> East.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All that was left was Trans Mountain. Did <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 price gouge on the purchase price? Of course. And why shouldn't they, 
given what has happened – or rather, not happened – in the past year?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The point is that it should never have reached this stage. By January of last year, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> had met every requirement of both the federal <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board (NEB) </span>process and B.C.'s five conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what's been going on 
for the past 15 months? Some will point to the May, 2017, election of 
the NDP minority government in B.C. and their pledge to “use every tool 
in the toolbox" to block the Trans Mountain expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, the B.C. election 
was a proximate cause, but the deeper, formal cause has been Mr. 
Trudeau's own public rhetoric on climate change. From Paris onward, he 
has aided and abetted the antipipeline movement by repeating the 
climate-change militants' own dogmas, stigmatizing Canada's oil and gas 
industry and undermining the reputation of the NEB. All of this has 
legitimated and emboldened the very groups that are now trying to block 
the Trans Mountain expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the one positive to come out of all of this is that we won't have to listen to any more nonsense about <b>social licence</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposition that 
imposing carbon taxes, closing down coalfired electricity and 
subsidizing renewables would turn pipeline opponents into pipeline 
supporters has failed completely. Try to name one convert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or listen to U.S. environmentalist Bill McKibben of <span class="companylink">350.org</span> or our own climate-change wizard, David Suzuki. Both are adamant that all oil sands oil must stay in the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trudeau has been 
speaking out of both sides of his mouth since he was elected, and now it
 has caught up with him. In Paris, he paraded as the Prince of Climate 
Change. When he was in Houston, he was a champion for export pipelines. 
He wanted it both ways, but now he can't: He owns a pipeline and has 
promised to complete it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To do this, he will have 
to go to battle with the very groups that supported him in the 2015 
election – urban climate-change activists, Indigenous communities and 
maybe Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile Mr. Trudeau's new, erstwhile allies in this battle – Alberta, Saskatchewan, the <b>energy</b>
 sector and other business interests – did not support him in 2015 and, 
for the reasons discussed above, are no more likely to support him in 
2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the next election 
only 17 months away, the Liberals are in trouble and they know it. Mr. 
Trudeau is the architect of his party's demise. But the rest of us will 
have to pay for it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">HTC PURENERGY INC</span>. ANNOUNCES UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER PERIOD ENDING MARCH 31, 2018</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">HTC Purenergy Inc</span>. has released its unaudited condensed consolidated financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HTC Purenergy and its 
subsidiaries have chosen to refocus its business units in the 
environmental technologies sector. The acceptance of climate change and 
the <b>social licence</b> that corporations are moving toward are upon 
the company in force. Carbon footprint and the capture and management of
 CO2 (carbon dioxide) has become effectively a currency of business, a 
vehicle for penalty and taxation, and a statement to shareholders who 
expect environmental responsibility from the companies they invest in. 
The company notes that all segments of the <b>energy</b> sector must 
contribute and, as such, the management of CO2 from combustion-fired 
plants can be used not only to reduce emissions, but also to improve oil
 production through the use of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques. 
HTC has focused its efforts in this area over the past few years, as EOR
 provides an immediate economic benefit to an oil company (in addition 
to being able to meet its <b>social licence</b> responsibilities).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The natural gas industry 
has taken on a new challenge of gas cleanup of CO2, SO2 (sulphur 
dioxide) and other contaminants, while ensuring that the solvents and 
the glycols that are used in the cleanup process are recycled and 
reused, and providing a significant cost reduction to the customer at 
the same time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HTC's delta purification division is showing promising results, as the <b>energy</b> industry and many larger industrial companies have joined the "re3" revolution: reclaim, recycle and reuse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tertiary oil 
production business requires a significant amount of water for 
production of steam and, at the same time, a significant capital cost to
 install traditional heavy oil production technologies. Assist <b>Energy</b>
 Solutions Corp.'s SCV technology allows the use of brackish production 
water (that normally would have to be disposed of or treated) to be used
 as steam for <b>energy</b> production. The SCV technology also allows 
the heavy oil producer to bring existing non-producing wells back 
on-line with a minimal investment in capital costs. "Reclaim, recycle 
and reuse" is more than a tag line for the company. The company is a 
world leader delivering technology in this solvent and glycol sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial results</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the period, the 
company had revenue of $21,884 ($114,300 for the quarter ended March 31,
 2017). The decrease in revenue is due to fewer sales in Maxx Group of 
Companies Corp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the period, HTC had 
expenses of $690,179, compared with $938,346 for the quarter ended March
 31, 2017. The decrease of $249,167 is primarily due to a decrease of 
costs of sales of $102,837, due to nature of services provided versus 
products sold in the prior year, a decrease in commercialization, 
product development and administrative expenses of $148,528, and other 
sundry variances between periods. Decreased costs are mainly due to 
reduced Maxx and Maxx subsidiaries activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Net loss for the period 
was $229,663, compared with a net loss of $476,425 as at March 31, 2017.
 The reduced loss is primarily due to decreased operating expenses and 
increased income from equity investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comprehensive loss for 
the period is $159,086, compared with a comprehensive loss of $613,620 
at March 31, 2017. The loss reduction is attributable to net income and 
the change in unrealized gain on investments classified as available for
 sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total assets for the 
period were $32,009,792, compared with $27,222,061 as at Dec. 31, 2017. 
The increase is attributable to increase in property, plant and 
equipment associated with the development of grain and fertilizer 
handling facility projects as well as the financing received for the 
projects (reflected in the stronger cash position).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Current liabilities were 
$2,420,534 for the period, compared with $1,584,236 as at Dec. 31, 2017.
 The increase is largely due to timing of activity levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long-term debt increased 
from $177,653 in Dec. 31, 2017, to $4,056,672 at the end of the period 
as a result of $4-million in financing received by Maxx Group.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Justin 
Trudeau took the stage on Tuesday evening at The Globe and Mail Centre 
in Toronto hours after his government announced a deal to acquire the 
Trans Mountain pipeline, and was introduced as “Canada's newest oil 
baron."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trudeau took the joke
 in stride, responding that his grandfather owned gas stations, so 
perhaps it's appropriate his government is dropping $4.5-billion to take
 over the controversial <b>energy</b> project from <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Inc</span>.
 If the Prime Minister can duplicate his grandfather's track record, 
taxpayers will do just fine out of the Trans Mountain deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Trudeau needs to get his timing right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charles-Émile Trudeau, a 
lawyer by training, spent the 1920s acquiring gas stations around 
Montreal, then sold the chain of 30 outlets to <span class="companylink">Imperial Oil</span>
 in 1932 for $1-million - and as they say, that was when a million was 
worth something. That investment formed the base of the family's 
fortune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal Liberals 
bought Trans Mountain to fulfill their commitment to get Alberta oil to 
the British Columbia coast after its Houston-based owner threw in the 
towel on plans to triple the pipeline's capacity in the face of fierce 
political and public resistance, especially in B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government is already trying to find a willing buyer to take Trans Mountain off its hands. Investment bank <span class="companylink">Greenhill &amp; Co</span>.
 has been hired to pitch the project to everyone from pension-fund 
bosses to private-equity investors to pipeline companies. But the timing
 is off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No private company will 
be willing to go near Trans Mountain when the fate of the project 
remains in doubt. As long as environmentalists and other opponents 
believe they can stop the pipeline, its owner will be a political 
target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No chief executive wants 
to associate the corporate brand with scenes of pipeline protesters 
being led away in handcuffs, or deal with endless court challenges from 
B.C.'s NDP government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So for now, the pipeline 
can't be flipped. The challenge for Ottawa - and Bay Street - is 
figuring out how much of the longpromised pipeline expansion must be 
built before the perceived risks begin to drop away and buyers step up 
with attractive offers. Opinions on this are all over the map.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The head of one 
investment bank, speaking anonymously because his firm desperately wants
 to work for a future buyer, told me the Liberals will not get full 
value for Trans Mountain until the project is 100-per-cent done, with 
oil flowing into tankers in Vancouver harbour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His second-in-command, in
 the same conversation, insisted there would be a lineup of buyers at 
30-per-cent complete. This banker said heavyweight U.S. investors such 
as <span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway Inc</span>., which already has significant stakes in Canadian utilities, and <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> would be potential bidders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bankers are also working on plans to help Trans Mountain win an elusive <b>social licence</b> by selling the project to a consortium of public sector pension plans with solid environmental credentials, including the <span class="companylink">British Columbia Investment Management Corp</span>. It's worth noting that the country's biggest fund, the <span class="companylink">Canada Pension Plan Investment Board</span>, said on Tuesday that it is “not actively assessing an investment in the extension opportunity."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That language is telling. The message from CPPIB is: We're not interested now, but call us when the noise dies down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bright minds on Bay Street are also working on solutions to the problems that drove away <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>. If First Nations groups are raising concerns about the pipeline, bring them in as co-owners, as <span class="companylink">Suncor <b>Energy</b> Inc</span>.
 did by partnering with the Fort McKay and Mikisew Cree First Nations on
 a recent $500million investment in an Alberta oil storage facility. 
Canadian banks might be able to provide the financing to make those 
investments possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Infrastructure assets 
such as pipelines, and the dependable cash they kick off, are currently 
hot investments. If Mr. Trudeau can do as his grandfather did and build a
 business that supplies <b>energy</b> to customers who need 
ever-increasing amounts of fuel, Trans Mountain will have no shortage of
 buyers. But the government needs to reduce the risks before those 
investors emerge.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MONTREAL -- MONTREAL - To
 understand the counterintuitive political calculus behind Justin 
Trudeau's controversial decision to buy the Trans Mountain pipeline, one
 has to go back to the fundamental equation that has governed this prime
 minister's <b>energy</b> and climate change policies since his days in opposition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That Trudeau had no 
choice but to take over the pipeline if he wanted to ensure that the 
plan for its expansion did not die on the drawing board is not in 
question. By the time Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced the 
federal decision Tuesday, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> - the pipeline's parent company - was about to pull the plug on the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the real question is 
why would the Liberal government be willing to put an open-ended amount 
of political and financial capital on the line to keep it alive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If one connects the dots 
between most major policies that past governments have deemed to be in 
the national interest, one almost always finds they conveniently 
intersected with a ruling party's election prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Stephen Harper's decision to bail out the auto industry in 2009 was not 
unrelated to the fact that his path to a coveted majority government ran
 through Ontario. His conversion to deficit financing at the time of the
 global economic crisis was a deathbed one, at least in part dictated by
 the need to survive confidence votes in the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by that measure, Trudeau's Trans Mountain move is an outlier. The electoral math does not add up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the face of it, the 
prime minister has at best shored up half a dozen Liberal seats in the 
Prairies at the cost of potentially putting in play at least triple that
 number across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along the way, Trudeau 
has put himself on a collision course with many Indigenous 
constituencies, and he has destroyed his international reputation as a 
climate change-crusader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the stakes, the 
prime minister's pipeline gamble has even been compared to Brian 
Mulroney's decision to roll the dice in his relentless quest for 
constitutional reconciliation with Quebec in the early 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mulroney had a 
compelling incentive to stick with the constitutional file to the bitter
 end. After the Meech Lake accord failed, he could not have let it go 
without risking his governing majority as the result of defections to 
the nascent Bloc Québécois and without fuelling support for Quebec 
secession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is an economic case
 to be made for ensuring the Trans Mountain pipeline is completed. Of 
the projects designed to link the Alberta oilfields to tidewater that 
were on the drawing board when Trudeau became prime minister, it is the 
only one that is still actively pursued. Until the last B.C. election, 
it was also considered the most likely to get to completion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Trans Mountain 
expansion has also become as politically indispensable to Trudeau's 
agenda - at least in the mind of its Liberal overseers - as it may be to
 Canada's oil industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was always meant to be the poster project for the federal contention that it is possible to balance Canada's <b>energy</b> ambitions with a more aggressive approach to mitigating climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Trudeau came to 
power, the emphasis has been the part of the equation that involves 
putting a price on carbon pollution as a necessary step to earn a social
 license for a pipeline projects such as Trans Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Liberal government believes the flipside of the equation - that a <b>social licence</b> for a carbon tax cannot be sustained if it is earned on the back of Alberta's <b>energy</b> industry - to be just as essential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allowing the Trans 
Mountain expansion to die this week would have cost Trudeau the support 
of Alberta's NDP government for his national climate change framework. 
Back in March, Premier Rachel Notley tied meeting Ottawa's carbon tax 
targets to the future of the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking to next year's 
federal election, the demise of the Trans Mountain expansion would have 
meant giving opponents of Trudeau's carbon pricing strategy - starting 
with the federal Conservatives - a prime exhibit in their prosecution of
 the havoc they argue his policy will wreak on the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As so it is that while 
Trudeau is widely portrayed as having picked the polluters' side in the 
climate-change debate, the Liberals will argue that they have done what 
they needed to do to continue to advance a pro-environment agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only time will tell 
whether this government has trapped itself in an intricate web of 
twisted logic. If so, as of this week's Trans Mountain announcement 
Trudeau is unlikely to untangle himself from that web in time for next 
year's election.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa wants us to 
believe that its nationalization of the Trans Mountain pipeline is yet 
further evidence of its commitment to a project it has repeatedly 
described as in the national interest. Instead, this decision shows the 
total bankruptcy of the government's approach to pipelines; that 
policy's failure is now so total that the government is signalling it 
accepts that no private investor can be expected to bear the risks 
associated with pipeline construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finance Minister Bill 
Morneau's "don't worry, be happy" approach relies on saying there are 
plenty of investors who will be prepared to take the pipeline off 
Ottawa's hands once it is built. But the last four words of the previous
 sentence tell the entire story. The construction phase is the one that 
carries the highest vulnerability and danger of failure. Once in the 
ground and operating, the pipeline's risks, while far from zero, are 
acceptable to the private sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let us not lose sight, 
however, of the fact that, according to the Canadian Encyclopedia, there
 are 840,000 kilometres of pipeline operating in Canada today. Pretty 
much all of this hugely impressive network has been constructed using 
private capital that was effortlessly deployed by investors who saw in 
Canada a country with an intelligently designed and applied regulatory 
framework and an unshakeable commitment to the rule of law. That 
reputation now lies in tatters and we now learn that only the 
government, using captive taxpayers as bankers, can complete this 
project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor is the 
nationalization of Trans Mountain the only evidence of the failure of 
this government's pipeline policy. Cast your mind back to the moment the
 Trudeau government arrived in office. Leaving aside Keystone XL, there 
were three major pipeline proposals to bring Canadian oil to tidewater: 
Trans Mountain, Northern Gateway and <b>Energy</b> East. The Liberals 
had courted the environmental vote with promises that the permission of 
affected communities would be sought and obtained (i.e. "<b>social licence</b>")
 for such projects. In exchange for that local acquiescence, the 
Liberals were willing to offer a panoply of measures designed to 
reassure Canadians that pipelines met the highest standards. New 
regulatory burdens and standards, carbon taxes and, in collaboration 
with Alberta, emissions caps for the oilsands were all enacted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of this new burden 
was used to kill one of the three projects, Enbridge's Northern Gateway,
 thanks to offshore tanker bans and forbidding the routing of any 
pipeline through the so-called Great Bear Rainforest. The fact that 
Enbridge had spent over $1 billion on its proposal, had been granted 
permission under the law to proceed and was prepared to spend billions 
more of private investors' money, were not to be allowed to interfere 
with the government's virtue signalling. One down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next came the withdrawal of <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> Pipeline's <b>Energy</b>
 East project. The government at the time liked to put about the fiction
 that this was some kind of commercial decision by the company whereas 
the innocent government stood ready to support the project if it 
proceeded. Independent observers, however, are virtually unanimous in 
seeing the increased regulatory burden and political uncertainty 
(especially in Quebec) as having killed the project. Far from promising 
nationalization, the government heaved a sigh of relief. Two down, again
 dragging many hundreds of millions in private investors' capital with 
it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That leaves Trans 
Mountain, what former federal cabinet minister Brian Tobin might have 
referred to as the one last, lonely, unattractive, little pipeline 
clinging by its fingernails. Ottawa hopes nationalization of the project
 will send a signal of a resolute government determined to see this 
through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the contrary, though, 
this decision will be seen by foreign investors as an admission of 
weakness, not a sign of strength. Ottawa is essentially saying that such
 infrastructure, previously built by private capital under known rules 
and under the protection of the law, is now being built in an atmosphere
 in Canada that is so hostile and unwelcoming that it no longer expects 
private investors to shoulder the risk. Considering that one half of all
 business investment intentions in Canada derive from the 
capital-intensive natural resource sector, the negative fallout is 
potentially huge for future living standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not lost on those 
who build and invest in pipelines that on the day the decision was 
announced to buy Trans Mountain, the media were full of reports that 
Green Party Leader Elizabeth May was proudly paying a $1,500 fine for 
criminal contempt for having defied a court order not to obstruct the 
project's progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Count on hundreds, if not
 thousands more, following in her footsteps along the Trans Mountain 
route, assuming that legal challenges by B.C. and First Nations can be 
overcome. The Liberals are about to reap the <b>social licence</b> whirlwind whose seeds they helped to sow.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, we know how the 
Liberals will try to salvage our last opportunity to ship oil overseas, 
an overriding problem of their own making. At a price of $4.5 billion, 
the <span class="companylink">government of Canada</span> will purchase the Trans Mountain pipeline (TMX) from <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada</span>
 (whose market capitalization interestingly is $1.75 billion) and 
indemnify the cost of construction. Then it hopes to find a 
private-sector buyer in the short or medium term. A desperate buyer will
 become a desperate seller. Good luck!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finance Minister Bill 
Morneau dodged questions about the total hit to taxpayers. The project's
 capital cost is still officially $7.4 billion, but rumours are 
circulating that expenses could mount to $11 billion. So the total 
federal investment, with a potential $2-billion Alberta participation, 
will be well over $11 billion, in addition to overruns and environmental
 risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial indemnification, which most Canadians opposed, was not enough to entice <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 to stay in the game because Trudeau could not guarantee a definitive 
legal result, a co-operative B.C. government or social peace. Therefore,
 he could not preclude lengthy delays. Nor could he prevent a 
reputational hit to the company when Aboriginal elders and environmental
 activists carry signs (before soldiers cart them off to jail) decrying 
how <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> is threatening the 
B.C. coast. Capital is scarce and the company has investment 
alternatives that do not pose comparable risks. Now Trudeau must summon 
the fortitude to confront all those challenges and enforce the rule of 
law, or construction will be blocked indefinitely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government had to buy
 TMX because the project is crucial to Canada's economic prospects and 
national unity. Otherwise, our proven oil reserves, the third-largest in
 the world, would be effectively landlocked. However, Trudeau devoted 
the previous two-and-a-half years crowing about his green bonafides here
 and around the world. It has to be excruciating for him to nationalize a
 pipeline transporting diluted bitumen from the oilsands across British 
Columbia to Vancouver where workers will be confronted by irate 
protesters decrying his stunning betrayal. If it does not leave his 
environmental legacy in tatters it will, at the minimum, tarnish it 
irrevocably. Also, nationalization clearly signals that Canada was 
unable to retain or attract private-sector capital for a major resource 
project. Public money may address Trans Mountain, but resource 
development generally is in considerable doubt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the finance minister
 hightailed it down to Houston to meet Richard Kinder, his bargaining 
power was exceptionally weak. Kinder, doubtless frustrated by roadblocks
 and $1 billion in sunk cost, knew Morneau had run out of options, since
 his government burned the other two possibilities - Northern Gateway 
with a direct rejection and <b>Energy</b> East with regulatory 
impediments. Furthermore, the new Impact Assessment Act made it 
untenable for anyone to propose a major pipeline. Not surprisingly, 
Canada is viewed around the globe as a resource-rich country that 
literally cannot deliver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furthermore, this 
decision does not eliminate the possibility the project becomes bogged 
down in court challenges or civil disobedience, with no end in sight. 
Also, there are no guarantees private investors will show up in the 
intermediate term, if ever. In spite of initial support, a skeptical 
public may come to consider open-ended risk to be a very bad deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morneau has suggested our pensions funds, including the <span class="companylink">Canada Pension Plan Investment Board</span>,
 might be interested in investing in the project. The politicization of 
our national pension fund would undermine public confidence in the 
safety of our savings. Instead, pension fund managers will weigh TMX 
against alternative opportunities with less uncertainty, or politically 
risky projects with considerably higher returns. The Feds will have to 
assure a healthy profit before a pension fund or private sector investor
 commits billions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal legislation will 
not help. Senate Bill S-245 declared TMX a work "for the general 
advantage of Canada." While the House could pass that Bill, our 
legislators know it will not substantively add to federal jurisdiction, 
so it is pure showboating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this is a colossal 
political failure, which the prime minister will attempt to spin into an
 accomplishment. Even those who support the pipeline are worried about 
public ownership, government playing favourites, the open-ended cost to 
taxpayers and regulatory impediments that mean death by delay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fence sitting, obstruction and vacuous sloganeering have come to naught for the prime minister who pretended he could achieve a <b>social licence</b>
 by promoting both environmental protection and resource development. 
Consensus was always a naïve delusion. Now the government will have to 
muscle it through over entrenched opposition. It did not have to come to
 this, but when Trudeau promised to reconcile the irreconcilable, 
something had to give. The give is that taxpayers just bought a pipeline
 no one else wanted.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So you've bought yourself a pipeline, eh? Here are a few things to know about it:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The original route is 65 years old</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's 1150 km long.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First opened in 1953, the pipeline has run pretty well over its history, though it's averaged just over a leak a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heck, there was one on Sunday in Kamloops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What does your $4.5 billion get you</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, now you get the 
pipeline. You get the attached pumping stations, terminals and storage 
tanks. You got some pretty fancy signage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh and you get, by proxy,
 a whole swath of protesters. They're free, though. Of course, you may 
have to pay a bunch of cops to keep them away from your new employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then again, as you're 
hoping, maybe you'll find a private buyer for the whole thing by August.
 Just get that construction rolling!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Really? I can find a buyer?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business analysts point out that a pipeline is a pretty safe asset: a predictable stream of revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's oil going in at 
one end and coming out at the other, ready to be sold. You get paid for 
the transport. Pretty straightforward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so, you figure someone will want to pay for that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, you are still are going to have spend another $7 billion - at least</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You do have to build the 
new pipeline, which will run along the old right of way. This 
construction cost is on top of the $4.5 billion you just spent. <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> says they've already spent $1 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They figure to finish the expansion project will cost at least another $7 billion and maybe more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at the end of the day, you'll have tripled the capacity of the old pipe. Smooth business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just how much is $4.5 billion?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, the population of 
Canada at the last census was 36.29 million people. That works out to 
each of us owning about $125 worth of the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's really not too much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do you need permission from communities?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or just the courts?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the 2015 federal 
election Justin Trudeau and the Liberals insisted: "While governments 
grant permits for resource development, only communities can grant 
permission."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau even declared that while standing on the shore of English Bay. <b>Social licence</b> is the now-well-known term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One year later, in 
September 2016, the Trudeau government government tabled a document in 
the House of Commons that made no mention of the need for communities to
 provide permission. A statement from Resource Minister Jim Carr's 
office now defined <b>social licence</b> as "ensuring public confidence in the decision-making for major resource projects."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's this about a court battle?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Justin 
Trudeau wanted the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain pipeline extension built
 in the worst possible way, and now he has done it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, his 
government announced the pipeline to move Alberta oil to the B.C. coast 
for transfer onto ocean-going tankers and distribution to global markets
 will be built in the worst possible way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because instead of having
 the private sector do it, Canadian taxpayers are now the owners of the 
Trans Mountain, for an initial outlay of $4.5 billion, with the final 
cost likely to be around $7.5 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian taxpayers, conscripted by Trudeau, have now assumed all of the risk from Houston-based <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>,
 which halted work on the pipeline last month, threatening to abandon 
the project by May 31, because it was too financially risky to proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This given the court 
challenges to stop the pipeline by B.C. Premier John Horgan's NDP 
government and Indigenous opponents, along with protests by 
environmental radicals who want to kill it at all costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CEO Steve Kean said the deal is "a great day for Canada" and why wouldn't he? He's now off the hook and we're on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trudeau government 
said it will sell the pipeline back to the private sector once it's 
completed and economically advantageous to do so. Right. We'll see.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, will it even be 
possible, given this precedent, to build any future inter-provincial 
pipelines in Canada without federal ownership, as opposed to the United 
States, where Barack Obama boasted during his presidency that his 
administration had approved enough pipelines to more than encircle the 
earth? This despite Obama's hypocritical veto of the Keystone XL 
pipeline to move Alberta's oil to the U.S. Gulf Coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe, now that U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Donald Trump has lifted that veto, Trudeau will buy it with our money, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why has our 
self-described "green" PM, who used to babble about "phasing out" the 
oilsands, ended up buying a pipeline to ship oilsands oil to British 
Columbia and the world? Because once he was elected in 2015, he was 
confronted by the fact that our economy is losing $15 billion annually 
having to sell almost all of our oil to the U.S. at a huge discount, 
since we have no way to get it to global markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau's purchase of the
 Trans Mountain pipeline project delighted Alberta NDP Premier Rachel 
Notley, who will be contributing $2 billion to the pipeline's costs, if 
needed, from Albertans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What all this shows is 
the abject failure of Trudeau's and Notley's superficial and absurd 
belief that imposing a national carbon price on Canadians would give 
them the "<b>social licence</b>" to build the Trans Mountain pipeline, 
with the blessings of B.C.'s anti-oil government, Indigenous objectors 
and radical environmentalists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exactly none of that has 
happened, the future of the pipeline is still in doubt and billions of 
dollars of taxpayers'money are now at risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bad enough that people 
like hysterical, anti-pipeline protesters, as Robert Bryce explains in 
his book Power Hungry, refuse to accept the inescapable reality that "we
 use hydrocarbons - coal, oil and natural gas - not because we like them
 but because they produce lots of heat <b>energy</b> from small spaces at prices we can afford in the quantities that we demand."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when even the prime 
minister of Canada doesn't understand that reality, the end result is 
economic disaster. lgoldstein@postmedia.com @sunlorrie</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in the early 1980s, I did volunteer work for Nick Taylor. At the time, he was leader of the <span class="companylink">Alberta Liberal Party</span>. (That's right, in a previous life I was a Liberal. Before I grew up.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nick was a great guy to 
work for and to drive around the province with. An oilfield geologist by
 training, he was strongly opposed to Pierre Trudeau's National <b>Energy</b> Program (NEP).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the federal wing of 
his own party had created the NEP. They loved it and weren't about to 
change it, not even to help Nick get elected provincially. His 
protestations fell on deaf ears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And since Nick could do 
nothing to convince his own national party to amend its hated plan 
(which sought to steal control of the <b>energy</b> sector and its revenues from Alberta), Alberta voters didn't see much point in electing Nick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taylor later won election
 to the Alberta Legislature, but only after the Mulroney Tories had been
 elected and had begun to dismantle the NEP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was reminded of Nick, 
and his lead-footed driving of his Mercedes convertible, on Thursday 
when federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh announced he was now fully opposed
 to the Trans Mountain pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Singh has made a Nick Taylor out of his fellow New Democrat, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We shouldn't be surprised by Singh's stance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal NDP as a 
whole have been against every pipeline for years. And ever since he was 
elected national party leader last fall, Singh has leaned against Trans 
Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the eve of the NDP's 
last national convention this past February in Ottawa, Singh said Trans 
Mountain met none of his three conditions for approval: It didn't honour
 the principles of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples. It failed to meet climate-change goals. And it 
didn't (in his mind) create enough local economic opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, Singh's statement on Wednesday that he is now completely opposed to the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 pipeline is really just a variation on a theme. It's as if in February 
he said he was really opposed and now he is really, really opposed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if Rachel Notley 
cannot even get the national leader of her own party to back Trans 
Mountain, she's kind of in the position of my old pal Nick. What's the 
point of voting for her? And she can't get her fellow New Democrat 
Premier John Horgan to change his mind. And she can't get her buddy 
Justin Trudeau to actually do anything concrete to get the pipeline 
built, no matter how much she's cozied up to him politically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, again, what's the point? Her "<b>social licence</b>"
 theory hasn't worked. Her Climate Leadership Plan, with its carbon tax 
and coal plant closures has failed to change minds or policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Notley was first 
elected back in 2015, she made a big deal about blaming the lack of 
pipelines on the federal Harper Tories and the long-governing provincial
 Tories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their confrontational approach, she scoffed, had failed to get us a pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Justin Trudeau levelled similar accusations in Ottawa. If only the 
Tories, federally and provincially, had demonstrated more concern for 
climate change and tried to woo the "green" bees with environmental 
honey rather than economic vinegar, Alberta would already have the <b>energy</b> infrastructure it needed, according to Trudeau and Notley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, we've now had three years of the Trudeau-Notley approach, and if the Trans Mountain project survives past <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s deadline next week, it will not be because of some expensive, new, green-friendly strategy by the P.M. or our premier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will be because of the oldest tactic in the book: throwing gobs of taxpayers'dollars at the problem to make it go away.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Really!? Rachel Notley 
now says the reason she wants the Trans Mountain pipeline is so she can 
give us pharmacare - tax-funded coverage for prescription drugs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley wanted reporters 
to know Tuesday why she had chosen not to attend the western 
premiers'conference in Yellowknife this week. She said she was staying 
close to her office at the legislature so she could work on keeping 
Trans Mountain alive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pipeline builders Kinder 
Morgan have said if there is no deal on the line by next week, they will
 abandon the project. (That would make Trans Mountain the third pipeline
 abandoned by <b>energy</b> companies since the provincial NDP and federal Liberals came to office in 2015.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we want to have pharmacare, Notley told reporters, we need the pipeline and the tax revenues it will generate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we want to make sure that every Canadian can get the medications they need, we need to be able to pay for it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">lgunter@postmedia.com 
Really!? Seriously!? Notley's push for Trans Mountain since last 
November has really just been about expanding the welfare state? We need
 the pipeline so we can make government even bigger? It used to be "<b>social licence</b>"
 - the theory that if Alberta made itself an environmental leader with 
high carbon taxes and stifling eco regulations, "green" politicians and 
eco-activists would welcome our pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Notley's sales pitch is "give us the pipeline so we can expand the social safety net."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new approach will be no more successful than the last one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Greens" are detached 
from reality. They believe a magical transformation of our economy from 
fossil fuels to no-carbon alternatives will occur as with the wave of a 
wand. Seamless, swift, unnoticed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They refuse to see the connections between jobs and pipelines, between prosperity and oil. They don't believe the <b>energy</b>
 sector is needed to help keep us all employed, so why would they worry 
that elaborate new social programs are impossible without Trans 
Mountain? In their world, the non-polluting fairy-dust economy will 
provide all the money we need to live happily ever after.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(I'm not even sure I want Trans Mountain if all the proceeds are to be used for is an expansion of the suffocating nanny state.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Isn't the Alberta 
government (and Ottawa for that matter) spending enough money already? 
Since they came to office just three years ago, the NDP have ramped up 
spending from $49 billion to $56 billion. That's nearly 15 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We don't have a revenue problem, Alberta has a spending problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pharmacare could cost around $2 billion a year for comprehensive coverage in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But isn't it a little 
premature for Notley to be tying Trans Mountain to free prescriptions 
when her government is racking up deficits at the rate of about $10 
billion a year? Shouldn't they dig themselves out of debt before they 
start thinking of even more, elaborate, expensive social programs? And 
consider this: in a study released Thursday, <span class="companylink">Vancouver's Fraser Institute</span>
 estimates that by 2021, the cost of the interest on the NDP's debt will
 be about $655 per Albertan, annually. (It was $176 per person in 2015.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of even the most
 expensive pharmacare plan would be about $470 per Albertan, meaning it 
is excess borrowing that is squeezing out pharmacare, not lack of tax 
revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the NDP were even 
remotely better money managers, they would be able to afford pharmacare 
with the revenues they have now. Then Trans Mountain revenues could be 
used to restore the Alberta Advantage - to reduce taxes and get out of 
the way of job-creating investment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just to recap: In the 
quest to ship Alberta crude to overseas markets, the federal Liberals 
are down to one pipeline, having killed off Northern Gateway and allowed
 <b>Energy</b> East to die.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That pipeline, the Trans 
Mountain expansion, is now itself in considerable doubt, in part owing 
to the Liberals'previous encouragement (previous, that is, to coming to 
power) of its most determined opponents: by their delegitimization of 
the <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span>, which approved it; by the prime minister's apparent endorsement of the extra-legal doctrine of "<b>social licence</b>;"
 and by his apparent endorsement of another position found nowhere in 
law: that First Nations have a right, not just to be consulted, but to 
approve or disapprove of projects on lands to which they claim title.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It gets worse. With just 
one pipeline left to build, and having done their best to ensure it 
won't be built, the Liberals - having since declared (since, that is, 
coming to power) that in fact it will be built - are now down to one 
company to build it. One, or maybe none.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company that was going to build it, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>,
 last month said it will not proceed without some assurance that it can 
proceed - that it will not be subject to such delays, owing to the 
obstructionist tactics of the NDP government of British Columbia, as to 
make the whole thing uneconomic. It must have such assurance, the 
company says, by May 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not clear the Liberals can offer <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 the kind of assurance it needs - not by May 31, at any rate. The B.C. 
government has since referred a series of questions to the province's 
Court of Appeal asking whether it has authority to block the shipment of
 bitumen through the province; even if it is ultimately rebuffed, that 
is not going to happen before May 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals, meanwhile, 
have promised legislation clarifying and affirming federal jurisdiction 
over interprovincial pipelines, so as to deprive the courts of any 
wiggle room for the usual Solomonic finding of shared jurisdiction 
("co-operative federalism" and all that). The legislation, however, has 
yet to be produced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With just four sitting days left in the month, it is equally unlikely to be passed in time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the best the Liberals can offer <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 is a series of promises of what will happen after May 31: we'll pass 
the legislation, we'll win in court, and we'll compensate you for any 
delays. The finance minister this week described this as 
"indemnification" - insurance, basically - against the costs of B.C.'s 
political gamesmanship. How much this might amount to he did not say, 
with good reason: he can't. It's a matter to be negotiated with <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is that there
 is an imbalance in the two sides'negotiating positions. Notwithstanding
 the billion dollars it has sunk into the project to date, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 can walk away from it at any time, and will if it feels the capital 
required to complete the project could be more profitably deployed 
elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whereas the Liberals 
cannot walk away: they've committed, publicly and unequivocally, to the 
proposition that "the pipeline will be built."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's all very well for the finance minister to note the government might not have to pay out on <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s
 "insurance" policy - why, they might even charge the company a premium 
for it - but he's hardly in a position to dictate terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So to give themselves 
some bargaining leverage, the Liberals have been talking up all the 
other private companies they have lined up to take over the project, 
should they fail to come to terms with <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>. Companies like ... er, um, ah...... The reality is that if <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 is unwilling to complete the project, even with a federal backstop, it 
is unlikely any other private company would prove more willing. Not only
 would it face all of the same obstacles <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 faces - in addition to the B.C. government's opposition, there is a 
separate lawsuit by several First Nations, plus the mounting threat of 
physical force by protesters on site - but it could not be certain the <span class="companylink">NEB</span>'s approval of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s application would apply to it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So increasingly the focus
 of speculation is on other, "non-private" sources of capital. And here 
is where things start to get a little alarming. If overt nationalization
 is unlikely, that does not mean it could not happen by other means.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The finance minister was 
quoted telling Reuters this week of the many "very sophisticated 
Canadian pension funds and institutional investors" with the expertise 
to take on the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Again, he offered no names for the record, but it is significant that the first place the reporter went for comment was the <span class="companylink">Canada Pension Plan Investment Board</span>, an agency of government with fiduciary responsibility for the pensions of millions of retirees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CPPIB is free to 
invest in any project around the world. Is this really the sort of thing
 it wants to get mixed up in, a hugely contentious project backed by one
 of its government sponsors and opposed by another? Another possibility 
being floated is the nascent federal Infrastructure Bank. You'll recall 
the point of the bank was to be at arm's-length from political 
interference, and thus able to raise funds from private investors on 
strictly commercial terms. Yet hardly has it begun operations and the 
first thing it's supposed to finance is a pipeline the government has 
staked its life on? Maybe it will never come to that. Maybe the Liberals
 will find a way to keep <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> on board. But they are running out of options and they are running out of time.</p>

to complete the Trans Mountain expansion, it is unlikely any other

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we don't convince the
 world that we have our act together, as a country, on the environment, 
we will find it harder and harder to get our resources to world 
markets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was Justin Trudeau, 
during a 2013 speech in Calgary. Well, here in 2018, how together is 
"our" act on the environment? Currently B.C. and Alberta are staring out
 at each other over the ramparts on global warming. The Trans Mountain 
pipeline is the causus belli, but global warming, i.e., what is really 
meant by "the environment" these days, is what the strife in Canada is, 
and has been for quite a while, all about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever it does for the 
Earth, global warming raises the temperature in politics. Take the 
ardent catastrophist Naomi Klein for instance. Her view of it is as the 
hell mouth to "injustice, racism, intolerance and wars," a tidy quartet.
 On Canada's much abjured <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 pipeline, Klein is only a little less fretful. She speaks of that, 
among other drear indictments, as having the potential to "cook the 
planet." A sense of proportion is clearly not a dominant virtue when 
global warming is your cause. Her views are the views of the movement. 
She is a leading antagonist in the global warming war.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that war the Canadian 
oilsands has been the main front for over a decade. It has been the 
object of the world's environmentalists'most sustained crusade. It will 
not take a Jeopardy sage to guess which national government has been 
most avidly the champion of the cause. The Trudeau government, with its 
acute ambition to be seen as the whitest of the white knights in the 
combat against the Great Warming to come, its patent yearning to be seen
 as a, or the, major player in the great cause, has made the fight 
against what it calls climate change its most public and urgent 
endeavour. Global warming has, for all intents, replaced peacekeeping as
 Canada's bid for global stature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In doing so, it has 
recklessly enriched the atmosphere in which the campaigns against 
Canadian oil are conducted, and equally - until very recent days - has 
been passive to the point of prostration to all the propaganda 
incessantly targeting Canadian jobs and Canadian industry in the 
oilfields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It effectively cancelled <b>Energy</b>
 East, banned future tanker traffic, cancelled Northern Gateway, hosted 
innumerable summits on fighting climate change, instituted a national 
carbon tax, strong-armed Alberta into an illusory deal for "<b>social licence</b>,"
 silently wrote off thousands and thousands of jobs in the process, and 
famously lamented not being able to close down the "carbon economy 
tomorrow." All to earn credits with the internationalist global warming 
consensus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those campaigns for the 
moment meet and are most intense in British Columbia. The one pipeline 
left on the Canadian drawing board now has for years been hectored and 
harassed, subject to protest and serpentine regulation, and dragged to 
near extinction. In fewer than two weeks we will hear whether <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>,
 which has spent one billion dollars merely to extend a pipeline built 
in 1953, has tired of the exercise and, exhausted, simply abandons the 
project out of bottomless frustration. They must really wonder why, with
 so little welcome, and up until their deadline, they faced a federal 
government so committed to a cause whose triumph would be the negation 
of all <b>energy</b> industries, anywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back to getting our act 
together. The federal government is also on the ramparts facing the B.C.
 government, with Finance Minister Bill Morneau levelling a caustic 
fusillade this week at B.C. Premier John Horgan and his green cohorts 
for obstructing the national purpose and "unconstitutionally" seeking to
 override federal authority. The federal government is not quite as hot 
over Saskatchewan's demurral to play into its global warming policy of 
the carbon tax, but it has already singled out Saskatchewan for 
financial penalties, withholding federal funds from that province - a 
tactic it will not deploy, however, against the far more contentious 
B.C. This fuels a legitimate charge that the Trudeau Liberals play the 
game unfairly as between provinces, and thereby manufactures a fresh 
friction within our newly fractious federation. Meantime Quebec, never a
 spectator on this file, is on side with B.C., as it was active in 
killing the <b>Energy</b> East pipeline and therefore actively in 
contest with Alberta, and latently with the Atlantic region. Global 
warming is not a buttress of national unity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the rampage stirred 
up by greenism does not stop there. In Ontario, Kathleen Wynne, in every
 other sense a capable and intelligent leader, by adopting the global 
warming cause and making it an Ontario project, has utterly exhausted 
her popularity. The various results of the woeful "green" efforts - 
waste, artful subsidies to renewables, cancellation of gas plants, a 
forest of overpriced windmills, the dread carbon tax, and tumid 
electricity prices - have blistered her apparently irredeemably with the
 voters, and polls suggest has turned her party into political pariahs. 
The only person truly happy about Ontario's green policies has to be 
Doug Ford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within our Indigenous communities division is rife. Those which signed on to <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 plead to be heard and are either never mentioned in all the volatile 
press on the subject, or vastly overwhelmed by the Indigenous activists,
 who in most reporting on this subject earn the headlines and the lead 
story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Atlantic region 
Newfoundland is waking up to the consideration that its offshore 
industry will probably be the next target of the global warming zealots.
 The Maritimes are waking up, too, that they let pass the cancellation 
of <b>Energy</b> East with reckless unconcern. The economy of the region
 will pay for that indifference, and the current perfect cloud of 32 
Liberal MPs will pay for it too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trudeau government 
vastly overestimates and overpraises the power of "our example to the 
world." This is quite natural. Every author is the ideal reviewer of his
 own book. But to earn even that dubious international status, look at 
the costs at home. Canada's carbon tax, and its high zeal for the cause,
 cannot, in any substantial way, change the equations of the world's 
atmosphere. We are incidental to the problem, if indeed it is a problem.
 Whatever Canada does, or does not do, will not accelerate the crisis or
 diminish it, in any way that is meaningful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its zeal to be seen as
 champion for a problem we have minimal capacity to cure, this 
government has roiled the Canadian political landscape, stirred a 
current of rage in Alberta, set provinces bitterly at odds with each 
other, shattered the governing party in Ontario, placed useless taxes on
 an already depressed industry, and chased billions of dollars of 
investment money out of the country. Most grievously, it has already 
indicated to the world that Canada is a very inhospitable place for any 
projects large in scale that in any way might wander under the eyes and 
objections of global warming zealots, the politicians who support them, 
and governments that are their willing partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world has indeed 
already taken notice that Canada doesn't have its "act together" and 
Canada has already learned that it is "getting harder and harder to get 
its resources to world markets." It is certainly true of the most 
cardinal resource of global commerce, our oil.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Michael Binnion reports</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTERRE REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2018 RESULTS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questerre <b>Energy</b> Corp</span>. has released its financial and operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, president and chief executive officer of Questerre, 
commented: "Our production and cash flow growth this quarter was 
primarily driven by the increased investment in Kakwa. Production from 
the joint venture acreage almost doubled from the first quarter of 2017.
 With additional drilling scheduled for later this summer at Kakwa, we 
could see production dip in the next few quarters before a further 
increase by year-end."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: "Through a 
recent partnership with an experienced Montney operator, we plan to 
develop our immediately offsetting acreage. We are looking forward to 
the results from the first well given the strong condensate rates and 
low acid gas from our adjacent producing wells."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Highlights:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Average daily production over 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Adjusted funds flow from operations more than doubled to $4.7-million;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Questerre partners with experienced operator to develop Kakwa North acreage;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Questerre commissions integration study for Jordan oil shale project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commenting on Quebec, he 
noted: "We were encouraged by comments this May from the Minister of 
Environment noting that the Minister of <b>Energy</b> and Natural 
Resources will soon be tabling regulations for hydrocarbons. Once 
finalized, we will be meeting with the municipalities to secure the 
local acceptability we need. We are confident there is interest in our 
clean gas pilot and its environmental and economic benefits."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Updating developments on its project in Jordan, he further added: "During the quarter, we engaged <span class="companylink">Hatch Ltd</span>.,
 a global engineering firm, to review the engineering and economics for 
our oil shale project in Jordan. The initial project will target 
production of approximately 50,000 barrels per day and will include the 
costs to upgrade the produced oil to diesel and gasoline. Once this 
study is completed, we plan to commission a more detailed pre-FEED 
[prefront end engineering design] study as we commence negotiations for a
 concession agreement."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result of the 
increased capital investment in Kakwa last year, the company reported 
higher production volumes over prior periods. Production averaged 2,013 
barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter compared with 1,123 
boe per day for the same period last year with Kakwa accounting for over
 three-quarters of production during both periods. Gross revenue more 
than doubled to $9.54-million with higher production volumes benefiting 
from higher oil prices in the period. The higher revenue contributed to 
adjusted funds flow from operations of $4.65-million for the period 
compared with $1.41-million last year. The company reported net income 
of $60,000 for the current quarter compared with a loss of $520,000 for 
the first quarter last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capital investment for 
the quarter focused almost exclusively on Kakwa and totalled 
$8.66-million (2017: $5.32-million). The company anticipates incremental
 investment at Kakwa in 2018 could be up to $21-million and include six 
(1.5 net) wells subject to the operator's final plans and continued 
results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The term adjusted funds flow from operations is a non-international financial reporting standard measure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questerre <b>Energy</b></span> is leveraging 
its expertise gained through early exposure to shale and other 
non-conventional reservoirs. The company has base production and 
reserves in the tight oil Bakken/Torquay of southeast Saskatchewan. It 
is bringing on production from its lands in the heart of the 
high-liquids Montney shale fairway. It is a leader on <b>social licence</b> to operate issues for its Utica shale gas discovery in the St. Lawrence Lowlands in Quebec.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three of the world's largest investors are leveraging their combined $450 million in <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Inc</span>. shares to pressure the company to improve its environmental reporting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York State's $270-billion pension fund will table a shareholder resolution Wednesday at <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s
 annual meetings in Houston, calling for more environmental reporting - a
 proposal officially opposed by the oil company's management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move comes as controversy swirls around the Texas <b>energy</b> giant's Trans Mountain pipeline expansion in B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were initially 
concerned over the controversy over the pipeline and the potential for 
the reputational risk it was causing the company, which hurts 
shareholder value, and legal liability that could end up affecting 
shareholder value," said Patrick Doherty, the comptroller's corporate 
governance director for New York state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state's comptroller oversees its massive Common Retirement Fund, which holds more than $100 million in <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resolution follows a 
similar one last year that gained more than 34 per cent support among 
shareholders, something observers said is unusually high for such votes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even having 10, 20 or 30
 per cent of your investors telling you something is important to them 
is a message most CEOs will heed in one form or another," said Peter 
Chapman, executive director of the Shareholder Association for Research 
and Education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The social and environmental issues around <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s <b>social licence</b> are important - that has become a big issue with pipe construction across North America."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Wednesday's vote 
could exceed last year's 34.1 per cent support, Doherty said. That's 
because it's being backed by two even larger investors: the $457-billion
 <span class="companylink">California Public Employees' Retirement System</span> - America's largest public pension fund - and Norway's $1.3-trillion Government Pension Fund Global.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are two of the largest institutional investors in the world, and respectively hold $201 million and $146 million in <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> declined StarMetro's 
interview request Tuesday. "Sorry, we don't do interviews about our 
shareholder meetings," said spokesperson Dave Conover in an email. The 
company's board issued a lengthy response in its shareholder handout 
urging rejection of the resolution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our board unanimously 
opposes this proposal," the document said, raising concerns about its 
current environmental disclosure is sufficient.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less than two weeks 
remain until the Texas firm's deadline by which it will abandon its 
$7.4-billion twinning of its Trans Mountain pipeline unless the province
 abandons its efforts to stymie the project with environmental 
regulations.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Prime Minister is 
about to ask taxpayers to bail him out of a self-inflicted calamity - 
the inability to ship our oil to overseas markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau promised the $7.4
 billion Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion (TMX) would be built because 
it's the last opportunity to prevent our vast reserves from being 
permanently landlocked. Letting the project die would cause so much 
economic, constitutional and reputational damage that no amount of 
spinning could save his government from grievous political damage. B.C. 
Premier John Horgan declared he will do everything to kill the pipeline.
 Trudeau cannot tolerate a province thwarting the federal government on a
 critical matter within an exclusive federal jurisdiction. He has to 
defend the constitution and rule of law or the very viability of our 
confederation will be undermined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, Canada's 
credibility with foreign investors would be tarnished when capital is 
already heading south because of a dramatic reduction in U.S. corporate 
tax rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau's face-saving 
plan mirrors Ronald Reagan's observation: "If it moves, tax it. If it 
keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it." Due to
 B.C. hostility, federal inaction and regulatory overreach, TMX became 
too risky and expensive. Trudeau and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley 
exacerbated the problem when they naively proposed a grand bargain 
doomed to fail - impose a costly carbon tax in exchange for the <b>social licence</b>
 to construct Trans Mountain. Now the Feds, perhaps with the Province of
 Alberta, will write a whopping cheque or provide indemnification to <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> or another private investor, possibly accompanied by support for First Nations' investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most Canadians understand
 our oil must not be stranded. The opportunity cost of this project 
alone is estimated at $74 billion in revenue over 20 years. For a 
country with 10% of global proven reserves not to export its fossil fuel
 would be unconscionable madness. However, Trudeau is caught in an 
exquisite dilemma of his own making. According to a Nanos poll, over 
two-thirds of Canadians support the project, yet two-thirds oppose the 
use of taxpayers dollars to fund it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Prime Minister is responsible for why TMX is the lastgasp opportunity to access tidewater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He rejected the $7.9 billion Northern Gateway pipeline after Enbridge received the go-ahead from the <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board (NEB) </span>and the previous Conservative cabinet. Then <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> cancelled the $15.7 billion <b>Energy</b> East pipeline because the <span class="companylink">NEB</span>
 extravagantly expanded the scope of its review to include downstream 
emissions. Since the government didn't overrule its regulator, Trudeau 
cannot hide behind its project-killing policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, the new Impact 
Assessment Act politicized the review process and exacerbated 
uncertainty to such an extent that no private sector sponsor will ever 
propose a major pipeline again unless the legislation is fundamentally 
changed. Think about it. The government of a fabulously oilrich country 
has precluded overseas sales. Ironically, that would harm the 
environment since exporting Canadian crude could replace higher 
greenhouse gas emitting coal and lessen foreign imports arriving by 
tanker up the Saint Lawrence River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau won't punish 
British Columbians by withholding infrastructure funding or social 
transfers since that would damage his electoral prospects in 18 Liberal 
seats in the Lower Mainland. It would also send a provocative signal 
about federal power to Quebec with its 40 Liberal seats and whose 
moribund sovereigntists are always one perceived outrage away from 
resurgence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau will try to take 
credit for rescuing Trans Mountain. That is like a CEO whose blunders 
drove a company to the brink, but demands a bonus when shareholders are 
forced to inject funds to keep it afloat. The executive should be fired.
 Next year, voters will determine Trudeau's fate.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The leader of Canada’s 
Conservative Party insists his party would meet the Paris climate accord
 targets, but would not speculate on how it would do so. While Andrew 
Scheer is committed to dumping the federal carbon tax, he was mum on how
 his unfinished climate plan could impact on the oil and gas industry, 
one of Canada’s major greenhouse gas emitters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I am committed to 
ensuring that Canada plays its role [in the Paris accord]; you’ll pardon
 me for not unveiling every aspect or try to tip my hand. We are doing a
 tremendous amount of work to come up with a comprehensive plan on the 
environment,” Scheer said after an appearance at a Calgary Chamber of 
Commerce luncheon on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think there is a lot 
that can be done through incentives and through investments in research 
and technology, and that's always better than imposing a new tax on 
Canadian families.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a question and answer 
session with Sandip Lalli, president and CEO of the Calgary Chamber, 
Scheer blamed the governing federal Liberals for delays in construction 
of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>’s $7.4-billion Trans 
Mountain pipeline expansion, but said little about how a Conservative 
government would get it built in a more expeditious fashion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was cool on the idea 
of putting taxpayers dollars into the project or calling in the military
 should opposition on the ground attempt to further delay the project. <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> has set a May 31 deadline for the uncertainty around the project to be resolved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I believe very firmly that the issue around <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> is set in the backdrop of several decisions that were taken that shattered the confidence in Canada's <b>energy</b> sector,” he said, pointing to the cancelations of the Northern Gateway and <b>Energy</b> East pipeline proposals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And we have to talk 
about the carbon tax, which is a huge competitive disadvantage. When you
 put all that together, and then we see a provincial government taking 
action, that’s the tipping point for a project proponent. We called on 
Justin Trudeau to have a meeting with Premier [John] Horgan and Premier 
[Rachel] Notley months ago [and] nothing happened. The prime minister 
has the entire department of Natural Resources, the Department of 
Justice, at his disposal to come up with a plan. We are only now 
starting to talk about legislation to entrench and defend the relevant 
sections of the Constitution. We could have been having those debates, 
those conversations, taking those steps, back in January, February, even
 before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What a terrible 
indictment of his handling of this file. I am very disappointed and I 
sense the frustration here in Calgary and here in Alberta. It’s an 
emotional response because it’s their friends and neighbours who have 
been affected by this,” Scheer said. “I think everyone can agree, 
regardless of their political stripes, that the federal government 
investing tax dollars&nbsp;in an <b>energy</b> project is not the optimal solution. It’s come to here because of&nbsp;[Trudeau's] failures.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prime minister needs to be working with <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 to provide the confidence and the assurances that “it is not about the 
money, it’s not about taxpayers dollars. It’s about a plan, it’s about a
 timeline that they can work with in getting that project built in that 
timeline. I believe that if that was the focus then the use of 
government funds wouldn't be necessary,” said Scheer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, he said the 
pipeline has become a symbol for a larger issue. “I believe it’s 
essential to take a step back and remember how we got to where we are, 
and why is Trans Mountain the focal point. And it starts with right 
before the election where you have Justin Trudeau undermining the 
credibility of our science-based independent regulatory bodies who have 
for decades approved pipelines based on data and facts, and where there 
were improvements needed, ordered companies to make those improvements, 
and it worked. Canadians had confidence in it, until Justin Trudeau 
politicized it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So now all eyes are on 
Trans Mountain, the hardest of the three to get built because&nbsp;it 
is&nbsp;going right through the heart of the very place where the 
protesters are more prevalent, who have also been emboldened by the 
prime minister saying that they must give permission through <b>social licence</b> before projects can go ahead.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has now devolved into a
 “bizarre situation where we have a private company wanting to use 
shareholders money to build a project that would create jobs and 
economic activity in Canada, and the Liberal response is, well we are 
going to have to subsidize you to get to do that…. It should never have 
come to this. Hopefully we won’t be in the opposition too long and we 
can start to actually use the power of the federal government to get 
these important projects built.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked if he would 
consider bringing in the Canadian military to expedite pipeline 
construction, Scheer said: “I don’t think we have to get to there quite 
honestly. I think that that is something that the left would love to 
conjure up images of. There is a lot of space between here and there…. 
And in many cases it’s actually not the protesters that are the problem,
 it’s the NDP government of British Columbia that is the problem right 
now, and the RCMP and municipal police forces have to enforce the law. 
People don't get to just decide which laws to follow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think it is up to the 
federal government to make sure that the law is followed,” Scheer noted.
 “We have to be a country of laws. We can’t have people who disagree 
with the decision — a duly passed law or a legitimate use of the power 
of the government — we can’t allow these people who disagree with that 
to break the law, they don't have the right to do that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questioned about how the 
provinces are handling the pipeline impasse, Scheer found no fault with 
the Alberta government, but laid blame almost entirely on the federal 
government. “I think Premier Notley is in a tough spot, and whoever was 
premier of Alberta would be in a very difficult position, having to deal
 with British Columbia, but I don't want to focus on what one province 
should or should not [be] doing because my issue is that Justin Trudeau 
has done literally nothing for over a year and he has shown a complete 
lack of leadership and has forced provinces to take matters into their 
own hands, and they shouldn't have to do that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Social licence</b></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scheer also said the meaning of <b>social licence</b>
 has to remain science-based. “It’s funny [how] we have to define this 
now because it has been a term that has kind of been invented by the 
left, but I think fundamentally we have systems in place where experts 
and those that know&nbsp;the issue intimately, because&nbsp;they have 
got the training and they have the scientific credentials, are delegated
 to make decisions for us based on their best observations. And this 
isn't just about the <b>energy</b> sector,” he said. “Whether it’s a 
planned road or an LRT or a subway line, we have to have a 
decision-making process that citizens can have confidence in and then 
live with the decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As long as you have a transparent process based on a non-political approach to these things, then that is where <b>social licence</b> rests.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supercluster initiative</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In regard to innovation, 
Lalli noted, “other countries have been successful around clustering” in
 reference to the federal government’s $1 billion supercluster 
initiative, and asked what a Conservative government would do to promote
 innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s easy for 
governments to spend money and have big announcements,” Scheer said. 
“What is not seen is the cost of spending that billion dollars. And all 
the little decisions that get made for an entire economy because the 
government has made those choices and perhaps not other choices, or 
because they had to collect those taxes and take them out of the economy
 in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And then you have the 
idea that governments somehow can predict where these things are going 
to happen. I think a big fallacy for many politicians, certainly those 
of the Liberals and the NDP, is that there is somehow this giant 
switchboard that manages the economy and we can pull levers and turn 
dials and push buttons and we can grow the economy by having people in 
Ottawa guess and predict and do things better, and I don't agree with 
that at all. I think that the organic nature in which the free market 
works is always, always better than planned economies or decisions being
 made in government offices.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Internal, external trade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scheer said a 
Conservative government would work to ensure free trade among Canadian 
provinces. The current state of internal trade barriers, on items like 
alcohol, which was recently upheld by the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>,
 doesn’t send a good signal when negotiating trade deals with other 
countries. “It weakens our moral position, but also it weakens our 
economic position.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>, Scheer challenged the Trump administration’s sector-by-sector approach. “We have a challenge with <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>
 and the Conservative party has certainly tried to do what we can to 
support the government’s efforts. We have been critical with them here 
at home&nbsp;when we think they have missed opportunities,” he said. 
“But we have spoken with a united front when we go to the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have a particular 
challenge with the Trump administration, and that is, the U.S. 
administration right now is looking at trade along the lines of a 
sector-by-sector surplus or deficit calculation, so instead of looking 
at a trading relationship as a whole and saying, on the whole, what’s 
our trade surplus or deficit, what’s the economic impact, they are 
really drilling down into steel and aluminum and agriculture and 
manufacturing and auto,” and in any one of those sectors, not accepting 
the U.S. having a trade deficit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That's not an 
appropriate way to evaluate a trading relationship because as you know, 
every country does some things well and some things better and relies 
and benefits from another country doing other things well. For example, 
Canada has a massive deficit when it comes to citrus fruit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And as well we want [the
 federal government] to focus on jobs,” he added. “They are bringing a 
lot of social issues to the negotiation table that really don’t speak to
 market access and the jobs that go with that. So we think they should 
stay focused on keeping trade barriers away and improving market access 
for Canadian goods and services.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Productivity</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked what his government
 would do to increase productivity and help small and medium sized 
business to scale up, Scheer pointed to reforms to education to better 
target students to jobs. “One of the things we can do … is link skills 
training with available jobs, and rather than the model that many 
governments use which is to have the bulk of their&nbsp;focus on skills 
training going to other levels of government and then on through, kind 
of following the student.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We could also have 
support that goes to where the job is. So rather than say to a student, 
here is funding and you pick what you would like, part of the solution 
could be saying, OK, here is a training partnership with a company that 
knows that right now or in three or five years, there are going to be 
these types of jobs available, and attract the people to those jobs so 
that students aren't getting qualified or training in areas where there 
aren't jobs available, or where they likely won’t be. In other words, 
allow the market to play more of a role in allocating resources for 
skills training,” he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Hendrik van Alphen reports</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WEALTH ANNOUNCES TRINITY PROJECT DRILL PROGRAM</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Wealth Minerals Ltd</span>. has provided a 
Trinity project update. The company is finalizing a drill contract and 
expects to begin drilling before the end of May, 2018. Drilling will 
consist of three drill holes to test priority drill targets identified 
during transient electromagnetic surveys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Wealth holds the largest
 portfolio of lithium brine projects in Chile and our recently announced
 partnership with ENAMI has paved the way for development of those 
projects. With this critical partnership, the company has shifted 
priorities from accumulation of projects to systematic technical 
evaluation to determine which projects will be prioritized moving 
forward, especially now with the ENAMI alliance that allows both 
companies to move the projects forward quickly. Henk van Alphen, Wealth 
Minerals' chief executive officer, stated: "The worldwide demand for 
inexpensive and accessible lithium is on the verge of a dramatic spike 
with the continued implementation of new transportation and 
communication technologies and an ever-increasing demand for <b>energy</b>-storage
 solutions. Wealth's project portfolio is poised to become an 
increasingly important factor in the global lithium industry, and we 
have a visionary strategy for bringing this essential commodity to 
market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Drill testing of targets
 at Trinity is an important step in a process that will see several 
projects evaluated by the end of H1 2018," Mr. van Alphen continued. 
"The company is planning an initial program of three holes to test 
highly conductive zones interpreted to represent potential near-surface 
lithium brines."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drilling program</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company completed TEM
 surveys (see previous news release, Jan. 28, 2018) on the Trinity 
project. TEM surveys identified highly conductive zones, which are 
interpreted to represent porous media with high-salinity fluids 
(potentially lithium-bearing brines) at depth. Multiple anomalies are 
identified within the survey area with several drill targets southwest 
of the surface brine area. These targets represent the highest priority 
for exploration as they have the highest tenor conductivity (lower 
resistivity) suggesting greater saturation and/or higher salinity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drilling program is 
scheduled to drill three holes using a sonic drill rig to a depth of 400
 metres each, collecting brine samples at 50-metre intervals. Management
 expects the drill rig to be at site by the end of May and to have 
completed the drill program by June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Community outreach</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the immediate area 
adjacent to the Trinity project is devoid of a permanent population, 
Wealth has engaged with the greater area population to ensure that all 
stakeholders in the Trinity project development area are informed as to 
the company's activities and to ensure that the company has a <b>social licence</b> to operate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About Qusiquiro property</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Quisquiro property, 
part of the company's Trinity project, has been designated by the 
Chilean government as one of the top 15 potential lithium producers in 
the country, and an additional independent analysis has given the 
property the highest possible Tier 1 designation, strongly suggesting 
expected lithium-brine concentrations found to range from 423 
milligrams/litre to 1,080 mg/l Quisquiro salar is held by SQM and <span class="companylink">Wealth Minerals</span> only.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Abbotsford News -- 
Representatives from Steelhead LNG and Huu-ay-aht First Nations were in 
Ucluelet last week to give residents an overview of the proposed Kwispaa
 LNG project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $10-billion 
development of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility at Sarita Bay near
 Bamfield would be co-managed the two parties and has already received a
 positive vote from a Huu-ay-aht First Nation 
referendum[http://www.steelheadlng.com/huu-ay-aht-makes-history-with-approval-of-sarita-lng-project/#more-1715]
 in March 2017. Elected board members of the Alberni Clayoquot Regional 
District (ACRD) also passed a motion with a 13-1 vote to support the 
project in principal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Jack, who sits on 
Huu-ay-aht First Nation council, addressed the crowd at last week's 
event to answer questions from the community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The reason we're 
investing in LNG is we need the money. We need the money to build the 
schools and hospitals and daycare facilities and elder care facilities 
and all of these things," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Before we even talk 
about economic development projects like tourism, like hospitality, we 
need some source of capital to do it so this is the tradeoff. This is 
what we are doing. We are using this amount of land to produce a 
facility that will generate income that we need and employment that we 
need in order to even create what we think should have been there had 
Huu-ay-aht always been self-governing."</p>

Bay[https://www.westerlynews.ca/news/coast-clashes-over-proposed-lng-facility-slated-for-sarita-bay/]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jack said the Huu-ay-aht First Nation wants to be involved at every stage of the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't just have a 
voice, we have a vote," he said, and went on to describe that one key 
aspect of the co-management arrangement between the Huu-ay-aht and 
Steelhead is the existence of a project oversight board that includes 
three individuals from each party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Kwispaa LNG project manager, Nathan Gloag, the <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span>
 has granted Steelhead LNG four licences to export in the aggregate of 
24 million tonnes of LNG per year for 25 years from Sarita Bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The community of Bamfield has yet to grant the <b>social licence</b> to operate an LNG export facility in the Barkley Sound, however.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Approximately 20 locals gathered outside the community hall prior to the information session to voice their concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation Hjalmer Wenstob grew up in Barkley Sound. He is opposed to the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You know, we've gone 
through so many protests and so many actions in the last few years. So 
many of the people from the grassroots are raising up to have a say. And
 we recognize it doesn't always mean there's change, but we have to 
stand up for what we believe in. I have a little girl and I want her to 
know the beauty of home and the beauty of Sarita."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps easy to miss amid
 the understandable political uproar over Canadian pipelines (or perhaps
 more appropriately, our apparent inability to build them) was the <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span> Monthly Merchandise Trade Report in February that tracks Canada's international balance of trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report indicated 
Canada's trade deficit amounted to $2.7 billion, which widened from $1.9
 billion from the prior month, with imports advancing 1.9 per cent 
month-over-month, mostly due to higher purchases of <b>energy</b> products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hidden within those summary numbers was the revelation that imports of <b>energy</b>
 products into Canada advanced by a material 15.4 per cent to $3.4 
billion, the highest level since November 2014, with the largest share 
of those imports originating from the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The importation of crude 
oil and bitumen advanced 15.4 per cent, with imported refined petroleum 
products up by 24.1 per cent, the latter due largely to increased 
imports of gasoline into B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's increased importation of oil and its products reflects a growing trend in the past two years since the <span class="companylink">U.S. Congress</span> ended a 40-year ban on oil exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accompanied by surging 
U.S. production, crude oil exports from the U.S. to Canada (seasonally 
adjusted), have risen from $6.4 billion from September 2015 to February 
2016, to $8.4 billion from September 2017 to February of this year, or 
by about a third.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While these numbers fluctuate monthly, the point is that in February, while Canada exported $8.8 billion in <b>energy</b>, it also imported $3.38 billion from international sources, which, according to <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span>, represents a year-to-year increase of 12.3 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada produces far more 
oil than it can consume, and hence it is the world's fourth largest 
producer and third largest exporter of oil. In 2016, Canada was the 
largest foreign supplier of crude oil to the U.S., with 99 per cent of 
our oil exports directed there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada accounted for 41 per cent of total U.S. crude oil imports and 20 per cent of U.S. refinery crude oil intake. However, <span class="companylink">Natural Resources Canada</span>
 also indicated that in 2016, Canada imported crude oil and equivalents 
from many countries, including the United States (62 per cent), Saudi 
Arabia, Algeria, Nigeria and Norway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when Canadian 
attentions, both public and political, are riveted on our pernicious 
lack of pipeline access to international oil markets, we question why so
 little attention is being paid to Canada's increasing importation of 
petroleum products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It cost Canadians $3.4 
billion in February alone. To be clear, we are not arguing a trade 
surplus or deficit is an appropriate barometer of a country's health. 
However, we do suggest growing U.S. exports, due to deregulation, and 
our inability to build infrastructure to export our <b>energy</b>, is not beneficial to Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada could enhance its 
security of supply, reduce its trade deficit and produce fewer global 
greenhouse gas emissions if we used more of our Canadian crude oil 
production. A recent study by the <span class="companylink">Canadian <b>Energy</b> Research Institute</span>,
 using 2016 data, indicates that substituting Canadian oil wherever 
possible using space on existing pipelines, rail cars and ocean tankers,
 could reduce foreign oil imports into Eastern Canada by a whopping 47 
per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This would save 
refineries $210 million and reduce Canadian emissions of carbon dioxide 
by the equivalent of more than two million tonnes, or about 5.7 per cent
 annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute also found 
that eastern Canadian refineries process just over one million barrels 
of oil per day, of which only 39 per cent originates from Western Canada
 and five per cent originates from the eastern Canadian offshore; fully 
56 per cent is imported from the United States (amounting to 260,000 
barrels of imported oil per day).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly, lower regulatory
 and fiscal costs would benefit all Canadians through the more efficient
 utilization of Canadian resources. Hence, we urgently need better 
policies to resolve our pipeline infrastructure problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a precarious B.C. 
government opposes oil pipelines, the Trudeau government's avowed 
transition away from fossil fuels appears perversely to be directed 
solely at penalizing Canadian producers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is overregulating 
domestic producers with misdirected policies that allow foreign 
petroleum imports - unimpeded by Canadian environmental laws, so-called <b>social licence</b>,
 greenhouse gas reduction strategies and associated taxes - to flood 
into Canada to displace jobs and discourage investment. Ron Wallace has 
served on federal, provincial and territorial <b>energy</b> and 
environmental regulators and advisory boards. Jack Mintz is the 
president's fellow at the University of Calgary's School of Public 
Policy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nelson Star -- The Trans 
Mountain Expansion pipeline has dominated news in the past few weeks. 
The public is divided over whether we should build this pipeline and 
allow Alberta oil sands output to increase, or whether it presents too 
much risk to BC's rivers and coastal environments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many experts described 
the original project approval process as deeply flawed. The Liberals 
ignored their campaign promise of a new, improved process and instead 
sent a ministerial panel along the pipeline route in the summer of 2016.
 Many communities and First Nations governments criticized this process 
as inadequate as well. However the panel did write a report that ended 
with a list of six clear questions for the government to answer before 
making a decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think it would be useful to review those questions to see more clearly how we got into this quagmire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Can construction of a 
new Trans Mountain Pipeline be reconciled with Canada's climate change 
commitments? Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr often proclaims "This 
pipeline will be built", but I have never heard him say "We will meet 
our Paris targets." For many pipeline opponents this is the crux of the 
problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. In the absence of a comprehensive national <b>energy</b> strategy, how can policy-makers effectively assess projects such as the Trans Mountain Pipeline? Canada needs a national <b>energy</b>
 strategy that would answer broader questions such as: what role new 
pipelines would play in a world where world oil demand (according to the
 <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span> itself) 
will begin declining in 2019; how we might refine our oil resources for 
our own use rather than exporting bitumen and importing foreign oil on 
the Atlantic coast; and how we can create good jobs in renewable <b>energy</b> as the world shifts to a low carbon future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. How might Cabinet 
square approval of the Trans Mountain Pipeline with its commitment to 
reconciliation with First Nations and to the UNDRIP principles of "free,
 prior, and informed consent?" This is perhaps the key question that the
 federal government failed to answer before it approved the Trans 
Mountain Expansion. There is strong opposition to the project from many 
First Nations, and a number of lawsuits are in the courts arguing that 
the approval process did not involve proper consultation. If this is 
found to be the case (as it was in the Northern Gateway pipeline 
decision) it could delay the project another year or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. Given the changed 
economic and political circumstances, the perceived flaws in the NEB 
process, and also the criticism of the Ministerial Panel's own review, 
how can Canada be confident in its assessment of the project's economic 
rewards and risks? According to Nanos Research only 2% of Canadians have
 strong confidence in Canada's <b>energy</b> regulation system, a fact that bears on the discontent seen on both sides of this debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. If approved, what 
route would best serve aquifer, municipal, aquatic and marine safety? 
Kinder Morgan has not yet asked the government for approval of the exact
 route for much of the pipeline; in many cases the old route will not be
 followed, especially in the Lower Mainland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6. How does federal policy define the terms "<b>social licence</b>"
 and "Canadian public interest" and their inter-relationships? Through 
the election campaign, Justin Trudeau repeated the mantra "governments 
can grant permits, but only communities grant permission". The federal 
government now finds itself in a very difficult situation, having to 
tell coastal British Columbians that the project is in the national 
interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is now too late to 
answer these questions before Kinder Morgan's self-imposed deadline of 
May 31, but we would have been in a much better situation had the 
government fully dealt with them before approving the Trans Mountain 
expansion project.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What happened to <b>social licence</b>?
 Will this country ever build a pipeline to tidewater again? 
Unfortunately, these are questions that need to be asked now that the 
Trans Mountain pipeline project has been thrown into jeopardy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As I'm sure you've heard, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 announced it is suspending work on the project. They are worried the 
pipeline will be tied up indefinitely, and who can blame them? The prime
 minister failed to take immediate action to address the situation with 
the British Columbia government. The Liberals already vetoed the 
Northern Gateway pipeline, a political decision that had nothing to do 
with science. Then they killed <b>Energy</b> East with last-minute regulatory changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What kind of signal is this sending to anyone wanting to invest in Canadian <b>energy</b>? It's no surprise that the Liberals have now presided over the biggest decline in Canadian <b>energy</b> investment in 70 years - a loss of $80 billion dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On April 14, the prime 
minister finally announced that he might be working on a plan for the 
Trans Mountain project. But he needs taxpayer dollars to do it. <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> didn't ask for tax dollars - they want to get to work on the pipeline, and they just need a guarantee it will go ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether you agree with 
this course of action or not, it is an indictment of this government's 
policies that the private sector might now need tax dollars to be 
convinced to build something in this country (and the verdict is still 
out on whether even that will be enough). Furthermore, a government 
stake in the project won't do anything to placate those holding up the 
project with their opposition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As recently as last week (while on a trip to France), the prime minister said he wants to "phase out" the Canadian <b>energy</b>
 sector. We now have the carbon tax, regulatory changes, and inaction on
 Trans Mountain as proof that he means what he said. Despite their 
promises, this government's policies have done nothing to secure the 
so-called "<b>social licence</b>" we were told was needed to build approved pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Needless to say, this is bad for Canada - and especially Alberta. <b>Energy</b>
 companies don't just provide employment - they actively invest in our 
communities. Thousands of community centres, hockey rinks and 
neighbourhood events across our province are sponsored by <b>energy</b> companies. Not to mention important services, such as the STARS Air Ambulance. If the <b>energy</b> companies leave, we lose an incredibly important community partner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To all those who have written to members of parliament, attended rallies, and shown their support for Canadian <b>energy</b>
 - thank you. I know there are so many people who have lost their jobs 
and suffered needless hardships because of this government's decisions. 
Please know that we will keep up the fight in Ottawa. The best way to 
get the Canadian <b>energy</b> sector back on track is to replace this Liberal government in 2019.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is in the middle 
of a pipeline crisis because three of the four main actors in this drama
 need a pipeline but don't want one. Meanwhile, the fourth actor wants 
one but doesn't really need it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three politicians in 
this circus - Alberta NDP Premier Rachel Notley, Liberal Prime Minister 
Justin Trudeau and B.C. NDP Premier John Horgan - are all "greenies" and
 would rather <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s Trans Mountain expansion not be built for environmental reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet for one reason or another, all three of them need Trans Mountain (even though Horgan won't admit his need publicly yet).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley and Trudeau want 
Trans Mountain the least. They have drunk the "green" Kool-Aid and truly
 think our atmosphere is going to hell in a pipeline. They are committed
 to the notion that Canada can (and should) end the use of fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only reason Notley and Trudeau are now defending Trans Mountain is that both need it for fiscal and political reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley clings to the hope
 that if she can get a pipeline well underway before next spring's 
provincial election, she will be able to convince enough Alberta voters 
to stop hating her government enough that her NDP can sneak a second 
term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She also knows there is 
no way Alberta's budget will ever be balanced again without the revenues
 associated with at least one pipeline. All the wind turbines and solar 
farms in the country can't replace the revenues from oil and gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, Notley bet the house on "<b>social licence</b>"
 - the theory that if Alberta self-inflicted enough economic pain in the
 name of the environment, other provinces and eco-protesters would 
welcome our pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, <b>social licence</b> hasn't worked because it was never going to work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, Notley was so confident in her airy-fairy theory that she gave Quebec a veto over <b>Energy</b>
 East: Don't like our climate plan? Don't take our pipeline! So, of 
course, because the Quebec government never wanted the pipeline for 
political reasons, they were only too happy to help kill <b>Energy</b> East by insisting the eco plan didn't go far enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So now, for political and budgetary reasons, Notley absolutely must produce a completed Trans Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Notley, Trudeau needs pipeline revenues to rebalance his government's budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And since Trudeau and his
 government created environmental rules that made it impossible for 
other pipelines to go ahead - such as Northern Gateway and <b>Energy</b> East - Trudeau's pipeline eggs are now all in <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s basket, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ironically, of the three,
 Horgan is perhaps the most pro-development (or maybe that should be the
 least anti-development). Still, he is forced to be the most vocal 
opponent because the British Columbians most likely to vote NDP are also
 those most against <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>. More
 importantly, his governing coalition is being held in power by three 
Green MLAs who would likely abandon him and force an election if he 
allowed Trans Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But consider this: The 
Horgan government needs resource revenues, too. And it knows B.C. voters
 like LNG (liquified natural gas). So when it is ready for another 
election, the B.C. NDP will likely approve LNG, triggering the Greens to
 bring the government down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that brings us to why Horgan could end up needing Trans Mountain as much as Notley and Trudeau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The feds could withhold federal approval of LNG until Horgan permits a pipeline to be built across B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And since Trans Mountain 
is the only pipeline still out there ... Kinder Morgan, of course, is 
the one player that truly wants Trans Mountain. But it has signalled it 
may no longer need it and will walk away. Which is why two of the actors
 who need the pipeline for political reasons are talking about buying 
Trans Mountain They'll use our tax dollars to enhance their political 
fortunes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Trans Mountain expansion will be built."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the nation mourning 
Humboldt's loss, pecking out an obstinate tweet about an oil pipeline 
wasn't at the top of Justin Trudeau's to-do list, yet out came the above
 tweet ahead of the prime minister joining members of the shattered 
community for last Sunday's vigil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome to government, 
where events never pause and most days are an endless series of bad and 
worse choices. Trudeau is certainly down to bad and worse on <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau might want this 
pipeline built, but if the company is wavering and the Green 
party-dependent NDP premier of the province through which it must pass 
hasn't yet found a body he won't chuck in front of it, at what point do 
you concede the Earth will not be moving? The answer from Team Trudeau 
is a ringing "not now, not ever."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are determined to see
 (Trans Mountain) built," Trudeau has told reporters. "It is in the 
national interest. It doesn't make any sense for us to continue to have a
 $15-billion discount on our oil resources because we are trapped with 
an American market. We need to get our resources to new markets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same words could have and did come out of Stephen Harper's mouth. Trudeau now has to bell the cat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't meant to be this way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harper's confrontational 
"cramthem-down-your-throats" pipeline policy was to be replaced with 
Trudeau's more charismatic approach that would accrue the "<b>social licence</b>" needed to grease construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Trans Mountain 
ultimately proves is 20 years of debate in Canada has split people into 
two irreconcilable camps: pro-oil and anti-oil. Preening at climate 
summits and taxing carbon won't make exporting oil kosher to those who 
are resolutely opposed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Giddy though the 
opposition parties might be, now is not the time for them to revel in 
Trudeau's mire. Seeing your opponent hoisted with his own petard is 
satisfying, but if the pipeline really is in Canada's national interest,
 the opposition should offer some constructive suggestions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the partisan urge is 
too strong. Further disincentivizing bipartisan efforts is the Trudeau 
carbon tax that is not particularly well-read by any capital-C 
Conservative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau shoulders a good chunk of the blame. His Pan Canadian Framework for Clean <b>Energy</b> and Climate Change with its plan for carbon "pricing" was effectively crammed down provincial throats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And with Rachel Notley 
and Kathleen Wynne's governments now in severe financial distress, 
voters there and across Canada will begin to wonder why they're on the 
road to higher taxes if those uppity British Columbians aren't holding 
up their end of the <b>social-licence</b> bargain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is where federal NDP
 leader Jagmeet Singh should have a useful intervention to make, given 
it's his provincial family on opposite sides of the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> dispute. But Singh has sided with B.C. and its brighter federal electoral prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government 
can, and should, re-assert its constitutional right to build the 
pipeline. And yes, the feds can join Alberta in slapping down money and 
insurance guarantees. But that's only half the battle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the communities along 
the pipeline route remain ready to obstruct its construction, it's going
 to take a lot more than bucks and words to clear the way. Even the 
stern words of a judge urging protesters out of the way might not do the
 trick. What then? Do the sunny ways of Trudeau allow for a hint of the 
army steel flashed by his father? Do we just watch him? Andrew

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was not inevitable 
that we should arrive at such a pass over the Trans Mountain pipeline 
expansion: province divided against province, First Nation against First
 Nation, with the economic union and the rule of law as potential 
collateral damage. A debacle this big does not come about without years 
of hard work on all sides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We should be clear on one thing: this is not a debate about a pipeline, or not any longer. It is about who decides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reasonable people will 
differ on the merits of Trans Mountain. But whatever anyone's opinion, 
there is a lawful process for deciding these things, and lawful 
authority to decide them. In the present case, those lawful authorities 
are the <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span>, the federal cabinet, and the courts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever anyone's 
concerns - economic, environmental, Indigenous or other - that is the 
process by which those concerns are adjudicated. And that is the process
 that approved the pipeline: the <span class="companylink">NEB</span>, 
the cabinet and the courts, all ruling in its favour (though not every 
legal appeal has been exhausted: a case is still before the Federal 
Court of Appeal on behalf of seven First Nations arguing they were not 
adequately consulted). Why, then, do so many feel entitled, not merely 
to disagree, or to protest, as is their democratic right, but to 
substitute their own authority for that prescribed by law: to defy the 
courts, to threaten disorder, and to deny federal jurisdiction? Much of 
the blame should be attached to the custodians of lawful authority, the 
governments of Canada and British Columbia. It was Justin Trudeau who, 
campaigning for office, gave his imprimatur to the extralegal, 
anti-democratic doctrine of "<b>social licence</b>," telling pipeline opponents that "governments might grant permits, but only communities can grant permission."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was Trudeau, too, who 
lent support to the notion that Indigenous communities have, not merely a
 constitutional right to be consulted on projects affecting lands to 
which they have title, as the courts have found they have, but an 
absolute veto. And it was Trudeau who legitimized those who, because 
they did not like the <span class="companylink">NEB</span>'s decision, had dismissed it as biased or negligent, with his promise of a special panel to review the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, it was John 
Horgan who, campaigning for office, famously promised to "use every tool
 in the toolbox" to stop the pipeline from being built. We know now that
 his government has known since at least the time it took office that it
 had no constitutional authority to do so. But if Horgan had hoped to 
walk back the promise, in the grand tradition of Canadian politics, 
after he was elected, he finds his way blocked by his partners in power,
 the Green Party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So he has instead opted 
to stall for time, delaying permits, threatening legislation, and - 
someday, maybe - referring the whole business to the courts, hoping the 
project's sponsor, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>, will 
give up in frustration. As, at length, it has declared it will do if 
Horgan's government is not brought to heel, with spectacular effect: it 
has spurred the Trudeau government to state, in terms that allow no 
retreat, that "the pipeline will be built."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But reasserting lawful 
authority, after so many years of disuse, will not be as easy as all 
that. It is not only the Trudeau or Horgan governments, after all, that 
have played this game: before Horgan, there was Christy Clark and her 
constitutionally odious "five conditions" for "approving" the Northern 
Gateway pipeline, and before Trudeau there were decades of federal 
governments that allowed the provinces to run the jurisdictional table 
against them, in the name of "co-operative federalism."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trans Mountain marks the 
final terminus of that process: as it is not possible for the feds to 
cave, so they are forced to act, in spite of themselves. That holds 
great peril - not for nothing did the government of Quebec, sensing a 
precedent, warn the feds not to intervene - but also great promise. But 
it will require great dexterity: a mixture of firmness and delicacy. 
Ottawa cannot simply snap its fingers and force the pipeline through - 
not at acceptable political cost, at any rate. But it can prevail, if it
 is patient and wise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this regard, the mix of measures emerging as federal strategy, belated as they are, show much promise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first: legislation 
explicitly asserting and defining federal authority over the pipeline, 
in some detail. That doesn't abolish B.C.'s recourse to the courts - 
nothing can - but leaves less room for it to exploit any ambiguities 
about federal intentions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second: some form of financial backstop to <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>,
 to assure it that its investment in a lawfully approved project will 
not be devalued, in whole or in part, by B.C.'s dilatory tactics. I have
 seen this denounced as a subsidy or bailout. The details will matter (a
 loan or equity stake would be inferior to a simple promissory note) but
 in principle it seems rather in the nature of compensation for 
expropriation - though it would be appropriate for the feds to recoup 
any payout from B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the third: some sort 
of face-saving sop to the B.C. government - more spending on protective 
measures in the event of a spill, for example. It may seem galling to 
reward it for its intransigence, but it is also probably necessary to 
smooth the path of eventual acquiescence, and gives it something to wave
 at the Greens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, yes. There is a 
fourth, unstated, part: legislation, now before the Alberta legislature,
 empowering the province to throttle supplies of conventional oil to 
B.C. The feds, to be sure, would have no part in such a flagrantly 
unconstitutional exercise, nor should they. But every good cop needs a 
bad cop.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTTAWA -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will hug just about anyone. But he is about to drop the niceties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's asked B.C. Premier 
John Horgan and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley - NDP leaders both - to 
meet him in Ottawa on Sunday to grapple with what seem like 
irreconcilable differences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Texas-based <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Inc</span>.
 announced last Sunday it is suspending the Alberta-B.C. Trans Mountain 
pipeline expansion project and setting a May 31 deadline for reassurance
 that its construction can proceed as approved in the face of opposition
 in B.C., where the minority government is vowing to halt it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta is apoplectic and
 threatens to throttle oil and gas supplies to B.C. residents, promising
 punitive legislation as early as next week in retaliation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The showdown poses a 
crucial test of Trudeau's national leadership: whether he can fulfil his
 promise to expand economic growth while balancing the concerns of 
Indigenous and environmental opponents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So forget "<b>social licence</b>." Trudeau's got his sparring gloves on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The PM, who once campaigned on a more collaborative approach to federalism, says "the pipeline will get built."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has called on B.C. to stop "obstructing" it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau says he has a 
"broad range of options" - legal, regulatory and financial - to assert 
federal jurisdiction over an interprovincial pipeline expansion that was
 already approved by the <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span> and the federal cabinet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So just what is on the table?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government won't 
discuss any "options" under consideration, especially financial aid, 
given concerns about having an impact on the publicly traded <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>. But sources say a plan will be ready before the next cabinet meeting on April 24.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some of the

enact a new bill - call it, say, the Trans-Mountain Act - to clearly 
define and assert federal jurisdiction on the project and hobble the 
B.C. NDP's planned reference to a B.C. court on the question of its 
jurisdiction. The federal government could take over permitting and 
other regulatory approvals for the project. It could clarify its own 
powers and add other burdens or outline penalties for the province if it
 tries to stand in the way of the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa could withhold 
discretionary funds from B.C. such as spending on regional economic 
diversification, innovation or other monies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government 
could, counterintuitively, require further environmental controls on the
 project, say double-walled pipelines or increased marine protections to
 further address Indigenous and environmental concerns - beyond the 
$1.5-billion oceans protection plan it already promised to address the 
previous B.C. Liberal government's concerns - in exchange for some kind 
of guarantee the B.C. government would cease its opposition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In theory, Ottawa could 
disallow a B.C. law or regulation that it declares as contrary to the 
national interest, but that kind of sledgehammer hasn't been used since 
the 1940s, and legal experts say convention suggests it should not be 
used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa could, however, 
invoke federal emergency powers to deal with protests if they were to 
block construction. However the RCMP already has lawful powers to 
enforce a B.C. court-ordered injunction against protests within five 
metres of two work sites, and last month arrested dozens of protesters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal sources dismiss 
talk of calling in the military. "None of this uncertainty is about 
protests," said one official. Rather, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s
 uncertainty centres on B.C.'s vow to put legal hurdles in the way of 
the project. "It's making investors skittish," the official said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finance Minister Bill 
Morneau said the government is looking to "de-risk the project so that 
it goes forward." In plain language, that means underwrite or assume 
some of the project's risk in some way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Tim McMillan, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum 
Producers, said "there are a 1,000 permutations" of what financial 
backstop could look like. Others inside government agree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government 
and/or the Alberta government could buy a partial or even a controlling 
stake (a highly unlikely, but not off-the-table option) in a project 
that is 30 per cent held by <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada Limited</span> and 70 per cent owned by Texas-based <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan, Inc</span>., one of North America's largest pipeline operators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upside: it would 
assure investors Canada is prepared to put its money where its mouth is 
to push the project through. The downside: the prospect of Justin 
Trudeau buying into an oilsands pipeline company would surely run 
counter to his stance on climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa could provide some
 kind of financial guarantee to backstop or insure any part of the 
project, such as construction costs, on a look-back or a go-forward 
basis - a kind of insurance policy for the $1.1-billion <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 has already spent or against future spending on a project estimated to 
cost $7.4 billion. Right now, because the project is not 
full-steam-ahead, construction costs are estimated at about $20 million a
 month, but if the green light is given to start large-scale 
construction, that is expected to run as high as $200 million to $300 
million a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa's options could 
include a loan guarantee. It could loan money and collect interest or 
forgo interest in exchange for equity knowing the return on the 
investment is secure. <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> has
 secured commitments from 13 of Western Canada's largest oil producers 
that they will ship heavy and light crude through the pipeline once its 
capacity is tripled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> won't say publicly what 
action it wants Ottawa to take, or whether it even wants the government 
to take an equity stake. The company won't comment on Sunday's summit in
 Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement to the Star, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 said it will continue to consult "with various stakeholders" to see if 
an agreement can be reached by June. "The focus in those consultations 
will be on two principles: clarity on the path forward, particularly 
with respect to the ability to construct through B.C.; and, adequate 
protection of KML shareholders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be clear, Ottawa has already narrowed the range of "options" it is prepared to take.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morneau dismissed outright B.C.'s request that Ottawa ask the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>
 to decide whether the province has any environmental or marine 
protection jurisdiction that would allow it to put new controls on oil 
flows in the proposed expansion of the Alberta-B. C. pipeline, in the 
name of defending B.C.'s coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't see a need to refer something to the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>
 when we already know that it's a federal jurisdiction," said the 
finance minister. "That from our standpoint is not a course of action 
that makes sense."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span> reference wouldn't solve anything by May 31 in any case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And for Justin Trudeau to
 claim success, let alone carry the banner of being a different kind of 
national leader - different than the polarizing figure that his father 
was - the answer would seem to lie in a political agreement to resolve 
differences, in the spirit of co-operative federalism, not in a 
judicially imposed resolution.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Trans Mountain expansion will be built."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the nation mourning 
Humboldt's loss, pecking out an obstinate tweet about an oil pipeline 
buried in political grief wasn't at the top of Justin Trudeau's to-do 
list. Yet the prime minister tweeted it out before joining members of 
the shattered prairie community for last Sunday's vigil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome to government, 
where events never pause and most days are an endless series of bad and 
worse choices. Trudeau is certainly down to bad and worse on the 
question of <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s crown jewel, which happens to double as his fig-leaf on oil and gas policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau the green 
carbontaxer might really, really (really) want this singular pipeline 
built, but if the company building it is now wavering, and the Green 
party dependent NDP premier of the province through which it must pass 
hasn't yet found a body he won't chuck in front of it, at what point do 
you call a spade no spade and concede the Earth will not be moving? 
Perhaps fearing for its economic and constitutional credibility, the 
answer from Team Trudeau is a ringing "not now, not ever."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are determined to see
 (Trans Mountain) built," Trudeau has told reporters. "It is in the 
national interest. It doesn't make any sense for us to continue to have a
 $15-billion discount on our oil resources because we are trapped with 
an American market. We need to get our resources to new markets." 
Indeed. The same words could have - and did - come out of Stephen 
Harper's mouth. Trudeau now has to bell the cat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't meant to be this way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harper's confrontational 
"cramthem-down-your-throats" pipeline policy was to be replaced with 
Trudeau's more charismatic approach that would accrue the "<b>social licence</b>"
 needed to grease construction, a canard that happens to be, despite the
 environmental hysteria, the only fauna killed to date along the 
pipeline's route.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To frame the debate as proeconomy versus pro-environment is to miss the point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Trans Mountain 
ultimately proves is the past 20 years of debate in Canada has split 
people into two irreconcilable camps: pro-oil and anti-oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preening at climate 
summits and taxing carbon won't make exporting oil kosher to those who 
are resolutely opposed. Over their dead bodies is the message being 
passed to Trudeau at the minute. It's not a question of law, it's a 
matter of will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Giddy though the 
opposition parties might be, now is not the time for them to revel in 
Trudeau's mire. Seeing your opponent hoist with his own petard is 
satisfying, but if the pipeline really is in Canada's national interest -
 and it is - the opposition should offer some constructive suggestions 
along with any withering scorn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the rather shouty and petty state of modern politics, this won't happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The partisan urge to 
nannynanny-boo-boo is too strong and besides, Conservatives will say, 
the Liberals didn't exactly lift a finger of support in opposition 
before assuming office and turning the matter into a constitutional 
crisis. Further disincentivizing bipartisan efforts is the Trudeau 
carbon tax, a big part of the government's <b>social licence</b> play that is not particularly well-read by any capital-C Conservative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here, Trudeau shoulders a good chunk of the blame. For all his talk of kumbaya, Trudeau's Pan Canadian Framework for Clean <b>Energy</b>
 and Climate Change - with its plan for carbon "pricing" - was 
effectively crammed down provincial throats. And with Rachel Notley and 
Kathleen Wynne's governments now in severe financial distress, voters 
there and across Canada will surely begin to wonder why the hell they're
 on the road to higher taxes if those uppity British Columbians aren't 
holding up their end of the <b>social-licence</b> bargain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is where federal NDP
 leader Jagmeet Singh should have a useful intervention to make, given 
it's his provincial brethren on opposite sides of the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 dispute. But to hope for substance from Singh is to wish for unicorns. 
Singh has done the easy thing and sided with B.C. and its brighter 
federal electoral prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where does this leave Trans Mountain? Shorn of friends and solutions, but all is not yet lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government can, and should, re-assert its constitutional right to build the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yes, the feds can join Alberta in slapping down money and insurance guarantees. But that's only half the battle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the communities along 
the pipeline route remain ready to obstruct its construction it's going 
to take a lot more than bucks and words to clear the way. Even the stern
 words of a judge urging protesters out of the way might not do the 
trick. What then? Do the sunny ways of Trudeau the son even allow for a 
hint of the army steel flashed by his father? Do we just ... watch him?

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is considering several ways to reduce the financial risk for <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 investors spooked by the uncertainty plaguing the planned Trans 
Mountain pipeline expansion, Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr said 
Friday as a high-level, make-or-break meeting loomed on the horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government is still 
examining its options, Carr said, but won't commit to a course of action
 before Sunday, when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau jets home from Peru 
for a hastily organized meeting in Ottawa with British Columbia Premier 
John Horgan and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What we're now faced 
with is to find ways to make sure there is more certainty than there is 
now," Carr said in an interview with the <span class="companylink">Canadian Press</span>.
 "One of the ways to make sure there is more certainty is to look at 
possible financial arrangements that would help de-risk the project."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pipeline builder Kinder 
Morgan has halted all non-essential spending on the project until it 
gets assurances from Ottawa that the issues will be resolved. The 
federal government has until May 31 to respond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau has put a lot of 
political eggs in the Trans Mountain basket, risking political capital 
among climate-change activists in search of middle ground that allows 
for pipeline construction alongside improved <span class="companylink">environmental safeguards</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau, who is currently
 in Peru for the Summit of the Americas, was originally supposed to fly 
to Paris directly from Lima on Sunday for meetings with French President
 Emmanuel Macron. Instead, he'll be back in the national capital in 
search of a resolution to an intractable - and politically perilous - 
dispute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carr refused to discuss 
the specific financial options available, other than to say there are 
many of them on the table and they're all being considered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of those options, 
however, is to buy a stake in the pipeline, something Notley has already
 said Alberta would be willing to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada and Alberta could jointly buy the pipeline outright, or at least a significant stake in the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another option is to 
provide a guaranteed source of revenue for private investors if the 
pipeline completion date misses the target for when returns on their 
investments were supposed to start flowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company had targeted 
May 31 as the make-or-break deadline to start construction if the 
pipeline was to hit those investment targets. That date is now the 
drop-dead date <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> has given Canada to prove the company should have the confidence to move forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Political strategist 
Robin Sears, a principal at Earnscliffe Strategy Group, said another 
option would be to increase spending on the environmental protection 
side, including on improved research into preventing and mitigating the 
impacts of a diluted bitumen spill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The company has not done
 what it needs to have done to satisfy the people of B.C. they have 
taken the steps necessary to protect the environment," said <span class="companylink">Sears</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sears said the Trudeau 
government has an oceans-protection plan on paper, but hasn't done much 
if anything to put it into action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carr was only prepared to
 say Sunday's meeting between Trudeau and the premiers would be a chance
 for the various sides to share their positions and try to talk things 
out - not necessarily a day when further action would be announced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, said <span class="companylink">Sears</span>, would be a bad political move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If they come out of that
 meeting on Sunday and [Trudeau] says, 'We've made good progress and I'm
 off to Paris,'it will cost them severely," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">University of British 
Columbia politics professor Kathryn Harrison said she doesn't know that 
there is a way for everyone to come out of Sunday's meeting with a win. 
"They have drawn lines in the sand that are simply incompatible," said 
Harrison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau and Carr have 
spent more than two years accusing the former Conservative government of
 themselves failing to build pipelines because they stacked the deck 
against environmental concerns, failing in the process to get the <b>social licence</b> necessary to allow the projects to proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals introduced 
new review processes that accounted for things like the potential 
greenhouse gas emissions resulting from increased oil flows. The <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board</span>'s 2016 approval of Trans Mountain required monitoring and upstream emissions offsets related to construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But environmental 
concerns remain - including the risk of higher emissions from increased 
oilsands production and the environmental impact of a spill. As a 
result, environmentalists who helped get Trudeau elected are now 
doubting his commitment to the cause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harrison said Trudeau has
 staked a claim on being able to reconcile both interests, offering up 
the pipeline - and the resulting ability to get resources to market - as
 a quid pro quo to get provincial and stakeholder support for a carbon 
price and environmental investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That was the compromise 
and they got pretty far with it," Harrison said, noting all provinces 
but Saskatchewan signed onto the climate-change framework.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're at that point now 
where the trains are colliding. This is a moment of truth for Canada and
 a country that relies heavily on producing fossil fuels."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent poll showing 
that a majority of Canadians don't understand or have never heard of a 
carbon tax demonstrates the gulf between the largely 
academic-bureaucratic elite who push for this tax and ordinary 
Canadians. For nearly three years, pro-carbon-tax governments and 
groups, such as the EcoFiscal Commission, which released last week's 
poll, have controlled the commanding heights of this debate with funding
 and media support the fossil fuel lobby can only dream of. They have 
nevertheless failed to parlay these huge advantages into public 
understanding and support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reasons the public 
has not rallied behind a carbon tax are clear enough. Promises that the 
carbon tax would be revenue neutral were quickly forgotten, revealing it
 as just another tax grab( 
http://business.financialpost.com/opinion/jack-mintz-carbon-pricing-has-been-fully-exposed-as-just-another-tax-grab[http://business.financialpost.com/opinion/jack-mintz-carbon-pricing-has-been-fully-exposed-as-just-another-tax-grab]
 ) that offended people on the right. Their promised aim of reducing 
emissions has ended up coming up short because the carbon levies, where 
they were applied, were not enough to materially change consumption when
 crude oil prices were falling, disillusioning people on the left. 
Carbon taxes also failed on the claim they would bridge the gap between 
the environment and the economy by creating the <b>social licence</b> to
 build a pipeline. In Canada, the final nail in their coffin was the 
election of a U.S. administration uninterested in an American carbon tax
 (or any costly climate measures) automatically putting Canadian 
industries at a competitive disadvantage with higher <b>energy</b> costs but no prospect of lower global emissions, making the whole exercise both costly and pointless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadians might be okay 
with carbon taxes - until they see the price(

 )</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Academic initiatives such
 as the EcoFiscal Commission and the like-minded Sustainable Prosperity 
Institute operate in an echo chamber where the converted preach to the 
converted rather than connecting with the general population. 
Presumably, the hope was that if enough academics and government 
officials signed on to a carbon tax the public would somehow internalize
 it via osmosis. Instead, opponents to a carbon tax are poised to soon 
take power in Alberta, Ontario and, based on the latest polling, 
possibly federally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal Liberal and 
the Alberta NDP governments plainly deserve the blame for failing to 
deliver on their promise that a carbon tax would buy <b>social licence</b> for pipeline construction, with the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain expansion just the latest casualty (after the cancellation of <b>Energy</b>
 East and Northern Gateway). They naively argued the environmental 
fringe could be reasoned with, ignoring that professional eco-warriors 
are possessed by what conservative sociologist Peter Berger called "mob 
psychology, the mystique of the street, the rage against all 
institutions of liberal democracy, and, last but not least, the militant
 anti-reason impervious to argument." Say what you want about U.S. 
President Donald Trump, but he quickly and peacefully ended the raucous 
protests against the North Dakota Access pipeline by showing he was 
implacably committed to building it, thus dissuading opponents from 
thinking their protests would produce the sort of dithering response 
they knew to expect from the governments of Justin Trudeau and Barack 
Obama. Four months after Trump took office, oil was flowing through the 
North Dakota pipeline, a visible demonstration to international 
investors of the difference in leadership between Canada and the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campaign for the 
carbon tax bears a close resemblance to that for the GST. While 
value-added sales taxes like the GST are universally beloved by 
economists and bureaucrats as more efficient than income taxes, elites 
have never been able to convince the general population that a sales tax
 is either efficient or fair. Implementing the GST helped to nearly wipe
 out the federal Progressive Conservative party in the 1993 election. 
Stephen Harper won his first election for the reinvented Conservative 
party by promising to lower the hated GST, something he carried through 
despite the strenuous objections of Finance Department bureaucrats. As 
recently as 2011, voters in B.C. refused in a referendum to harmonize 
with the GST, while Albertans remain militantly opposed to any type of 
sales tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Popular resistance to tax
 reform erupted again last summer in response to the overhaul of 
small-business taxes proposed by Finance Minister Bill Morneau. The plan
 was another arcane academic exercise, backed by the <span class="companylink">University of Ottawa</span>'s
 Michael Wolfson. Devising a tax scheme that seemed optimal in principle
 ignored the reality of how the tax would actually affect small 
businesses and farmers, a perfect example of what author Nassim Taleb 
calls the "Intellectual Yet Idiot" phenomenon in his newest book, Skin 
in the Game. Taleb notes that one of the distinct features of this type 
of advice is its complete separation from any consequences. Academics 
freely counsel naïve politicians, but when the plan meets opposition, 
politicians alone face the consequences in the court of public opinion -
 while their scholarly advisors quickly scurry back to their research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 20th century saw 
democracy advance as a result of the increased willingness of the public
 to question the divine right of elites to dictate how our society is 
run. A sea change occurred after the First World War, when the mindless 
slaughter of millions of ordinary soldiers in the trenches of Europe 
made irresistible the working class's demand for broader voting rights. 
As suffrage became more universal, elites have worried incessantly about
 so-called mob rule. Taleb wryly observes that when the population votes
 in a way condoned by the elite, it is approvingly called democracy in 
action; when they vote differently, the ominous spectre of populism is 
raised, never more so than after the election of Donald Trump. That same
 hypocrisy is clearly evident in the debate surrounding a carbon tax. 
The enlightened economists and politicians insist that any opposition to
 taxing carbon is Neanderthal, climate-denying populism. Yet obstructing
 the pipeline it was supposed to facilitate is somehow socially 
responsible and so it goes unsanctioned.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes leadership 
means recognizing that a train in the distance is headed straight at you
 and doing something about it before you are forced to jump out of the 
way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Justin Trudeau, the

rookie premier who signalled a year ago he would do exactly what he is 
doing today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
John Horgan is defending the British Columbia coast against increased 
tanker traffic, and whether or not one believes he has the right to hold
 up a project Trudeau has declared to be in the "national interest," he 
is doing precisely what he promised he would do if elected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Immediately after his 
election, there was rampant speculation that he would try to run out the
 clock to make the entire pipeline twinning project unpalatable to <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So here we are, a 
defining moment for the Trudeau government, with the clock ticking; a 
defining moment which Trudeau has largely brought upon himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau watched as Horgan and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley ratcheted up a trade war, and <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 should not have shocked anyone when it finally decided it couldn't 
continue to pour money into a project that has been continually stalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals, having already killed the Northern Gateway pipeline, watched <b>Energy</b> East die and their grand bargain with Notley rested with the Trans Mountain project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau needed Notley and
 her environmental initiative to sell his national climate change plan. 
Notley needed a pipeline win as her quid pro quo, a lifeline which could
 win her re-election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That grand plan is 
falling apart. With Jason Kenney waiting in the wings in Alberta, and 
Doug Ford looking covetously at Queen's Park, that national plan faces 
further peril.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is important to 
remember how a campaigning Trudeau promised to deal with pipelines and 
other resource development compared to where he stood Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On "<b>social licence</b>," the Liberal platform read: "While governments grant permits for resource development, only communities can grant permission."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was modified a year 
into the mandate with a more broad definition that dealt with 
consultation and dropped any reference to permission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, from the 2015 
platform was a promise to Indigenous Canadians that they would be full 
partners on resource projects: "This will ensure on project reviews and 
assessments, the Crown is fully executing its consultation, 
accommodation and consent obligations, in accordance with its 
constitutional and international human rights obligations, including 
Aboriginal and treaty rights and the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conservative 
opposition does itself no favours as it takes aim at Trudeau. 
Conservative MPs have been hit by a collective amnesia that makes them 
forget 10 years of Stephen Harper championing various pipelines 
accomplished nothing more than irritating official Washington and an 
infamous Harper declaration that Obama's approval of the Keystone XL 
pipeline, was a "no-brainer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Harper OK'd the 
Northern Gateway pipeline, no one from his government would stand in 
front of a camera to back the decision. It was left to wither until 
Trudeau mercifully killed it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With two NDP governments 
at war, federal leader Jagmeet Singh has effectively gone to ground, 
refusing to stand up to Notley or Horgan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau's tool box 
remains more formidable than Horgan's and federal action should win the 
day. This is a federal project that can't be held up by a province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to get there, Trudeau
 is going to have to force an unpopular pipeline expansion by bulldozing
 it past a provincial government, Indigenous leaders and protesters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau will expend much more than political capital. He will have his green bona fides shattered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he still might end up having to deal with Kenney and Ford in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A plan that looked so sound on paper has fallen apart on the ground.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mess Prime Minister 
Justin Trudeau has made of the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain pipeline 
dispute in British Columbia is the result of his Peter Pan Syndrome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the phrase 
coined by American psychologist Dan Kiley in his 1983 international 
bestseller of the same name, referring to childlike men who refuse to 
grow up and accept adult responsibilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This describes Trudeau's childlike approach to Canada's vital <b>energy</b> sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We saw it in his absurd 
suggestions during the 2015 election campaign that Alberta's oil sands, 
and Canada's entire oil and gas industry, were nothing more than 
temporary evils.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That Canada under Trudeau world earn the world's praise by painlessly transitioning our resourcebased economy to green <b>energy</b>, laughing all the way to the bank in the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such foolish boasts were examples of Peter Pan Syndrome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were best summed up 
in 2012 by Trudeau's good friend and current top political advisor, 
Gerald Butts, who said as the then head of the <span class="companylink">World Wildlife Fund Canada</span>: "We don't think there ought to be a carbon-based <b>energy</b> industry by the middle of this century."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suggesting Canada should abandon fossil fuels by 2050 revealed a staggering misunderstanding of Canadian and global <b>energy</b> needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><b>Energy</b> that can't 
be supplied by wind turbines and solar panels because, unlike fossil 
fuels, the power they provide is intermittent. It can't be stored for 
use when needed, nor is it economically feasible, given current 
technologies, without massive subsidies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bitter fruit of Trudeau's half-baked ideas about <b>energy</b>
 are seen today as the PM heads off for Peru while his cabinet ministers
 run away from reporters asking what the federal government plans to do 
to get the stalled Trans Mountain pipeline built, a project it says it 
supports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They resemble deer frozen in the headlights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're caught between Trudeau's election pandering to anti-pipeline protesters in B.C. and across Canada, and the reality our <b>energy</b>
 sector provides hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country, 
although not for much longer if we can't get our landlocked oil and gas 
resources to global markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As things stand, B.C.'s 
NDP Premier John Horgan vows to stop Alberta from shipping its oil to 
the Pacific coast through the Trans Mountain pipeline for export, while 
Alberta's NDP Premier Rachel Notley threatens financial retaliation 
against B.C. and urges Trudeau to do the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Texas-based Kimber 
Morgan, tired of procedural delays on its $7.4-billion project, has 
suspended none-essential work on its pipeline with a deadline of May 31 
to resolve the impasse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, federal 
Environment Minister Catherine McKenna assures Canadians the billions of
 dollars we're paying under Trudeau's national carbon pricing scheme - 
which was supposed to give him the "<b>social licence</b>" to approve 
pipelines - will achieve our United Nations commitments to meet our 
industrial greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in 2030. Except 
anyone who can add thinks that's impossible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this while federal 
Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr assures Canadians the Trudeau 
government is considering all options to get the stalled <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline going, while refusing to discuss them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They include everything 
from a constitutional challenge of B.C.'s delaying tactics, to a Supreme
 Court reference, to paying B.C. to withdraw its objections, to Ottawa 
and Alberta investing in the pipeline to reassure investors, to sending 
in the army to remove protesters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is what happens when
 a Canadian prime minister is stuck in Neverland and refuses to grow up.

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Corporate welfare won’t resolve 
the Kinder Morgan dispute; The idea that Ottawa and Alberta might take 
stakes in the company is the worst kind of political theatre</span>
</div><div class="author">Mark Milke </div><div>838 words</div><div>11 April 2018</div><div>The Globe and Mail (Breaking News)</div><div>GMBN</div><div>English</div><div>©2018 The Globe and Mail Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Milke is the author of multiple studies on the economics of subsidies to business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the great myths circulated by the anti-<b>energy</b> crowd in Canada is that the <b>energy</b> sector is heavily subsidized by taxpayers. Instead, as I found in my 2017 study for the <span class="companylink">Canadian Taxpayers Federation</span>,
 and as economist and taxation expert Jack Mintz has long argued, the 
claims are inflated based on a misuse of tax expenditure data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if such taxpayer subsidies are rarer than reflexive <b>energy</b>
 critics assert, it turns out that Alberta Premier Rachel Notley and 
Alberta Opposition Leader Jason Kenney are about to give succour to the 
critics’ accusations. Over the weekend, both said the Alberta government
 should take a financial stake in <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>, the company facing continual problems in twinning its Trans Mountain pipeline from Alberta to its terminus in Burnaby, B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, Ms. Notley said, 
“If we have to, Alberta is prepared to do whatever it takes to get this 
pipeline built,” and that included that “Alberta is prepared to be an 
investor” in the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> project.
 On Tuesday, she went a step further and declared she would consider 
buying the pipeline outright. Meanwhile, Mr. Kenney argued that while he
 was “philosophically opposed to corporate welfare,” that a “major 
market failure” had occurred. That, he said, justified an equity stake 
“to ensure economic progress.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let’s dissect both 
positions, but start with Mr. Kenney. There is no “major market 
failure.” Instead, there has been major government interference for more
 than a decade in getting Canada’s natural resources – oil, in this case
 – to markets. In the case of British Columbia, consider former premier 
Christy Clark’s 2012 “five conditions” if any new pipelines were to be 
constructed across B.C (this, as if the province was not subject to 
free-trading requirements in Section 92A(2) of the Constitution).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major government 
interference of course continues under the B.C.’s NDP government and the
 City of Burnaby. They are helped along by their anti-resource 
development activist allies on the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lastly, the federal 
government (and despite Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s and Natural 
Resources Minister Jim Carr’s protestations to the contrary) is of 
little help in getting the pipeline built. It is an open secret in 
Calgary that the Trudeau government’s multiple, extra regulatory burdens
 now being imposed on the <b>energy</b> sector mean that even if Trans 
Mountain is built, it will be the last pipeline project, ever. Multiple 
and multiplying regulatory government thickets are the reason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back to equity stakes: In
 addition to why corporate welfare is always a bad deal for taxpayers 
and a risk even when offered through equity, which often turns into a 
loss, an Alberta government financial stake in <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> would change none of the above dynamics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I’ve never believed Ms. 
Notley was serious in her tactics to force the B.C. government to 
reverse course on its anti-oil position. It is the same with her latest 
threats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, if Alberta’s 
leading politicians want to force the matter, and in a way that has 
impact, here are three immodest proposals: First, Ms. Notley should 
introduce legislation that signals her government will repeal the 
Alberta carbon tax. Absent any B.C. government backdown on the pipeline,
 and actual federal efforts to the same end, it is overdue to end the 
charade that Alberta’s carbon tax has enabled so-called <b>social licence</b>. It has not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, Ms. Notley should
 show up in British Columbia and endorse pro-pipeline B.C. Liberal and 
Skeena MLA Ellis Ross, the opposition critic for Natural Gas and 
Petroleum Resources. Political support for Mr. Ross, a former chief 
councillor for the Haisla Nation, would also force the B.C. government 
to go on the defensive vis-à-vis pro-<b>energy</b> First Nations. Ms. 
Notley’s political endorsement of Mr. Ross and betrayal of her 
same-party colleagues in Victoria is the only way to get their attention
 in a substantive way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last, the federal 
government – which likes carbon taxes and claims the authority to impose
 them on provinces, but also claims it wants Trans Mountain to proceed –
 could demonstrate its fealty to both propositions with a simple 
measure: Add $1 a litre to gasoline prices in British Columbia. One 
suspects $2.50 a litre for gasoline in greater Vancouver and nearly 
similar prices elsewhere in British Columbia would focus minds and 
finally provoke a reaction, and perhaps a B.C. government retreat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike an inadvisable equity stake in <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>,
 those three measures would constitute a serious and necessary 
escalation in this dispute. Anything else by politicians in Alberta or 
Ottawa would be useless theatrics.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's the answer to <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s
 decision to pause its Trans Mountain expansion project? Well, if you're
 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the answer is spending $280,000 in 
taxpayers'money for a study to tell you why oil investors are backing 
away from Canada. And if you're Alberta Premier Rachel Notley, the 
answer is demanding that Ottawa give a bailout to oilfield workers while
 your government maybe spends billions it doesn't have investing in 
Trans Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If anything, the 
developments in the last two days prove that not one of the major 
governments involved in the pipeline debate has any clue how jobs are 
created. And not one of the three - the federal Liberals, the Alberta 
NDP and the B.C. NDP - really, truly wants <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> to go ahead. Oh, sure, Premier Notley is doing her finest impersonation of a pro-pipeline politician.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her political future depends on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the <b>energy</b> sector and <b>energy</b>
 workers don't need bailouts and government investment. They need our 
NDP to eliminate its carbon tax, roll back the environmental regulations
 they have introduced and restore the Alberta Advantage. <b>Energy</b>-based economies in most of the rest of the world are growing strongly without bailouts and government investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Texas and Oklahoma, 
for instance, unemployment is under 4.0 per cent. In North Dakota, it's 
under 3.0. Because there, state governments don't have NDP-like Climate 
Leadership plans that have burdened their <b>energy</b> sectors with billions of added taxes and regulations in an effort to buy "<b>social licence</b>."
 The only oil economies that are floundering are those, like Alberta and
 Venezuela, run by lefty governments who think government intervention 
and public spending will spur growth as surely as private innovation and
 investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fastest way to get 
Alberta's economy moving would be for Ottawa, the Alberta NDP and the 
B.C. government of NDP Premier John Horgan to end their obstructionism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And until they do, it's 
doubtful that any amount of federal subsidy or Alberta provincial 
spending can make Trans Mountain go ahead. If the Trudeau government 
ended its new gender-based, Indigenous and ultra-eco assessments of <b>energy</b>
 projects, if it lifted its moratorium on West Coast tanker traffic and 
came out forcefully against B.C.'s delaying tactics and against 
loudmouthed eco-activists, Trans Mountain and other pipelines would 
proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Alberta NDP 
repealed their carbon tax and cancelled their hard cap on oilsands 
emissions and if the B.C. NDP stopped blocking the pipeline at every 
step, Trans Mountain would go ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s decision is not economic, just as <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s decision on <b>Energy</b>
 East last fall was caused by federal and Quebec politics, not the world
 price of oil. In a conference call with investors on Monday morning, 
Kinder Morgan CEO Steve Kean said something that should give Notley, 
Trudeau and Horgan great pause (but which all three will probably 
ignore).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kean said his company is considering investments in other pipelines elsewhere, just not in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the sticking point is not <b>energy</b>
 economics - those are pretty good again. The hold up is Canadian 
politics. That should chill Canadians to the bone across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our country has the third
 largest reserves of oil in the world. Yet we are in danger of being 
left behind in an investment ditch because our "green" federal and 
provincial leaders are clambering over one another to be climate change 
Boy Scouts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National economic policy is being determined by the ideas of radicals and environmental groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The international market for oil, bitumen and natural gas is strong enough to justify Trans Mountain AND <b>Energy</b> East AND Keystone XL, and maybe even Northern Gateway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is standing in the way of all of them are "progressive" politicians.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Notley government has spent three years doing everything it can to ruin Alberta's economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has imposed - and then raised - an unwanted carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has risked reducing development of the oilsands by imposing a hard cap on emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has raised taxes on <b>energy</b>
 companies, cozied up to the federal Liberals and accelerated the shut 
down of every one of our coal-fired power plants at a tremendous cost to
 Alberta taxpayers and coal communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in the process of paying for this, the NDP are on a path to rack up nearly $100 billion in debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this was done in the name of buying "<b>social licence</b>,"
 the theory that Alberta might win the agreement of the B.C. government 
and environmental activists to build pipelines if we showed a 
willingness to suffer economic pain in the name of saving the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's been all pain and no gain - at least $35 billion in lost investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunday's announcement by <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 that it was suspending any real construction work on its Trans Mountain
 expansion project is proof positive that Rachel Notley's "<b>social licence</b>" is what it has always been - horse droppings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, the premier herself is still drinking the <b>social-licence</b> bathwater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Notley were serious 
about getting pipelines built, at a Sunday news conference she should 
have stepped to the microphone and announced two things: She was 
repealing her government's carbon tax and she was withdrawing Alberta 
from the national climate pact - the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean 
Growth and Climate Change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the name of winning pipeline approvals, Alberta has been beggaring itself. We have been the ones doing ALL of the suffering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's now time for others 
to prove their sincerity to us. Let them seek our co-operation. For 
once, let them show their support for us, rather than Albertans always 
having to be the ones doing the proving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley should have 
suspended her government's carbon tax and ended her co-operation with 
the federal government until others do far more to help. <b>Social licence</b> is getting us nowhere, we should stop spending billions and billions on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But remember, this is the
 same premier who called our province the "embarrassing cousin" of 
Confederation for its environmental record before her. She is the last 
person who is going to back away for her government's disastrous Climate
 Leadership plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If our Peter Pan Prime 
Minister wants Alberta's buy-in on his climate plan and his carbon tax, 
he and his government have to take concrete action to get Trans Mountain
 built, not the other way around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sunday, federal 
Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr called on the B.C. government to 
"end all threats of delay" to Trans Mountain. Ooo, I'll bet that really 
got the NDP government of B.C. Premier John Horgan quaking in their 
loafers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two things: Carr's 
remarks are too little, too late. And how come tough-ish federal 
statements never come from Justin Trudeau? It is not lost on opponents 
of pipelines that Ottawa's tough talk comes from second fiddles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley could also have announced her government was shutting off gasoline shipments to B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If B.C. activists and 
politicians are so concerned about their carbon footprint, we should 
help them by forcing them to abandon their cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But instead of doing any 
of these things, on Sunday Notley called on Ottawa to offer the oil 
industry a bailout and suggested her government might spend even more 
taxpayer billions helping pay for construction of Trans Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She just doesn't get it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few hours before Prime Minister Justin Trudeau toured Canada's newest oilsands mine, the head of <span class="companylink">Athabasca Oil Corp</span>. took centre stage at Calgary's Metropolitan Conference Centre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the annual meeting 
Friday of the intermediate oilsands producer, CEO Rob Broen faced 
several questions from shareholders, but few about the company's 
day-to-day operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the audience wanted to know about oil pipelines. They asked about Ottawa's new review process for major <b>energy</b> projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And they wanted to know about the general state of the sector's competitiveness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If political leaders had a
 chance to listen in, they would have caught a glimpse into the nervous 
psyche of the industry and its investors today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These pipelines need to 
be built ... we need leadership at a federal level to make sure that 
happens," the CEO said in response to one question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Near as aI can tell, we 
have a tax - we have a carbon tax - but we don't have a pipeline and the
 opponents of those pipelines are more entrenched than they've ever 
been.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So the tax hasn't 
helped." Broen isn't the only oilpatch executive voicing concern about 
the industry's future in the face of complex challenges, such as rising 
production in the United States, the differential facing Canadian heavy 
crude and shifting government policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he quickly became one of the more vocal ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with federal 
approval of the Trans Mountain expansion, patience with slow progress on
 pipelines is wearing thin, although it's not entirely clear what more 
the prime minister can do to help propel these projects along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I would tell him he has 
to show leadership on the pipeline file and it's not just words," Broen 
said when asked what message he would give Trudeau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He needs to see it 
through to construction and make sure we can see shovels in the ground 
and get it built, for the benefit of all Canadians."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such comments underscore the dilemma facing the federal government today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau can repeat over 
and over until he's blue in the face that the project to the west coast 
will get built. But other pipelines, like <b>Energy</b> East, have failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until all of the court 
challenges are cleared, the protesters in Burnaby go home and Trans 
Mountain is finished - now slated for late 2020 - the industry's 
collective anxiety won't abate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Fort McMurray, Trudeau toured Suncor <b>Energy</b>'s Fort Hills oilsands project and later met with leaders of the largest petroleum producers in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suncor CEO Steve Williams
 said he was encouraged after speaking with the prime minister about 
issues such as market access, competitive pressures facing the sector 
and changes to the regulatory system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think we're going to get some help," Williams told reporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau reiterated his support for <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 and spoke about the "terrible price differential that is sucking $15 
billion out of the Alberta oil industry because we're not getting global
 prices" for Canadian crude.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he linked the federal
 government's national price on carbon and increased spending on marine 
safety to his cabinet granting approval to Trans Mountain and Enbridge's
 Line 3 replacement project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pieces all fit 
together. If one link in the chain falls apart, however, it threatens to
 pull down the entire national climate plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are folks out 
there who really like the idea that we're approving the pipelines ... 
but aren't too sure about the carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are other people 
across the Rockies who really like the idea we're moving forward on 
climate change and bringing in a national price on carbon, but aren't 
too sure about moving forward on a pipeline," he told reporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are standing up for Canadians'interests, as well as getting the <b>social licence</b> to get our resources to market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, it's not only 
pipelines causing heartburn in the oil industry. Leaders are also 
worried about the flight of capital out of the Canadian sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa now appears to be interested in examining the factors reducing investment in the oilpatch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this week, <span class="companylink">Natural Resources Canada</span>
 posted a tender for a $275,000 contract, looking for experts to 
evaluate the competitiveness of the upstream oil and gas sector and 
examine "recent regulatory changes and major market investment drivers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conducting the report 
suggests there is a willingness by Ottawa to take action, although 
Trudeau himself cautioned Canada "shouldn't be part of a race to the 
bottom."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After meeting with the 
oilsands executives Friday, Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr said the
 issue of industry competitiveness was raised by the CEOs during their 
hour-long session.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have to take very 
seriously what we are hearing from those who are in daily contact with 
investors," Carr said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We also have to keep a view of Canada's long-term competitive advantage."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the promise to build new pipelines, these are positive indicators, although there's no firm action yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The laundry list of 
concerns strikes to the fundamental issue for Canada's oil and gas 
sector today: Does the federal government really want to see the 
industry thrive and grow into the future? If so, what's it prepared to 
do to see that happen? Political tours, new reports and promises of 
support are welcomed, but there needs to be more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need to see an 
environment where this industry is supported," Broen concluded. Chris

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An interesting <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> thread in recent days has debated the importance of carbon policies, clean technology and the science behind climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the participants are federal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna and United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For that reason, 
Wednesday's release of the Ecofiscal Commission's report on the 
effectiveness of carbon pricing to fight climate was a very timely 
addition to the debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney has voiced his 
party's intent to scrap Alberta's carbon tax and replace it with a 
system of sector-by-sector regulation while McKenna is moving ahead with
 a national carbon price in the absence of provincial programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa intends to implement a $20 per tonne carbon price in January 2019, rising to $50/tonne by 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It remains to be seen if 
Kenney's ideas would satisfy Ottawa, however, and the reality could be 
Alberta will have a carbon tax - whether that's the provincially 
designed system that now exists or a federally imposed one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Either way, there's no escaping a carbon price in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is why the 
Ecofiscal Commission report should be required reading for all 
politicians, carbon price skeptics and the wider population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Especially Albertans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A poll released alongside
 the report showed that of all provinces, Albertans demonstrated the 
lowest support for carbon pricing, at just nine per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's possible some of 
this negative sentiment is tied to the fact the carbon tax was not used a
 bargaining chip to pave the way for a successful outcome in terms of 
pipelines to either the east or west coasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, it was 
not used as a quid pro quo, as some believe should have happened. Yet 
the report's lead author, Chris Ragan, suggests that approach isn't the 
right one, either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ragan said trading carbon pricing for the <b>social licence</b> to build pipelines casts the pipeline as 'bad' - because it will only be built if something 'good' is put in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The truth is the 
pipeline is a good thing. We need carbon pricing to solve one problem 
and we need a pipeline to solve another problem," he said in an 
interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The problem in this 
country is that these two things have become connected and they are 
almost completely disconnected. Our pipelines are about getting our oil 
to a world market that wants (it) and our carbon pricing is about making
 our consumers and our producers more emissions efficient."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This all means there is 
still a lot of work to do in better explaining how carbon pricing works,
 how it does not kill economic growth and why it is better than a 
regulatory approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's report is a step in that direction, while inserting some measured dialogue into a polarizing issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At the moment, Alberta 
is stuck debating for or against the carbon tax - as if there are no 
other options available," said Trevor Tombe , a professor of economics 
at the University of Calgary, citing regulation and technology subsidies
 as alternatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We ought to have that 
conversation regarding how we approach carbon emissions in Alberta 
because as the polls suggest the clear majority prefer action to no 
action; and now we should proceed to debate about the pros and cons of 
different policy tools."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike other reports, 
which Ragan admits were aimed at the policy level, this latest one is 
targeted at answering questions and satisfying skeptics as to why a 
carbon price makes sense, how it changes behaviour and doesn't harm 
economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ecofiscal Commission 
makes its case by using examples from British Columbia, California and 
the United Kingdom, since governments in those jurisdictions put a price
 on carbon. Alberta was not included in the analysis because its program
 has not been in place long enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the point the report -
 and Ragan - make is that it is the most effective method, in terms of 
changing behaviour and cost of implementation compared with a strictly 
regulatory approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Command and control 
regulations generally cost more than carbon pricing because they provide
 far less flexibility to businesses and households, and they typically 
ignore the important differences between them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenge with 
regulations is that companies know better about how to manage their 
operations than do governments - and regulations effectively impose a 
change by governments on how companies do business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A carbon price, on the 
other hand, provides incentives to change how companies operate without 
dictating what that change needs to look like. Net net, as investment 
bankers like to say, it ends up being cheaper than another layer of 
regulation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using B.C. as one example
 of the effectiveness of carbon pricing - Ragan points to the fact 
emissions there have dropped between five and 15 per cent since 2008 and
 the economy has done anything but stall. It should be said that 
province's economic growth has raised emissions on an absolute level, 
although they are lower than would have been the case without a carbon 
tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key factor in the recent success of B.C's economic growth is that its carbon tax was revenue neutral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that, said Tombe, was arguably the most surprising aspect to the polling data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The data showed 63 per 
cent of per cent of people who thought carbon pricing was a bad idea 
would be more supportive if the money was given back ... in the form of 
cutting other taxes by an equal amount. A revenue neutral carbon tax 
makes sense economically and politically," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's report and 
the polling data reinforce two things: action is preferred to no action 
when it comes to addressing climate change and the needle has not moved 
when it comes to <b>energy</b> literacy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is that 
finding common ground from which to solve complex issues such as climate
 change remains a challenge across the country. The latest Ecofiscal 
report is a good effort in constructively re-framing the conversation.</p>

Mr. Michael Binnion reports</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTERRE ENGAGES HATCH FOR ENGINEERING ON JORDAN OIL SHALE PROJECT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questerre <b>Energy</b> Corp</span>. has commented on the progress of the internal feasibility study for its oil shale project in Jordan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has recently engaged <span class="companylink">Hatch Ltd</span>.,
 a global engineering firm, to integrate and support its internal work 
on the technical and economic feasibility of this project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, president and chief executive officer, commented: "This
 is an important milestone. Our preliminary feasibility work has been 
completed. It has not identified any red flags or unexpected technical 
challenges. It also suggests this project could be economic at today's 
oil prices. We are looking forward to the results of the Hatch 
integration study later this summer to endorse our internal work."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commenting on next steps,
 Mr. Binnion added: "Depending on the results of this integration study,
 we would move to pre-FEED [prefront-end engineering design] 
engineering. These results and the subsequent pre-FEED and FEED 
engineering will form part of the proposed work program for the 
predevelopment phase of a future concession agreement with the Jordanian
 government."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, the 
company completed a review of the last of its nine studies covering all 
four aspects of the production of crude oil from its project in Jordan. 
These include mining and feed preparation, retorting, power, including 
utilities and infrastructure, and marketing and refining. The studies 
were completed by independent engineering firms, including Hatch, to 
develop technical and cost-effective solutions for these processes. Due 
to the size of the existing Jordanian refining infrastructure and the 
market for crude products in Jordan, the company has included the costs 
to upgrade the produced crude oil to finished products, including 
gasoline and diesel. Hatch completed four of the nine studies and will 
integrate all the studies into an independent assessment. The design 
basis for this assessment will be an initial project capable of 
sustaining production of 50,000 barrels per day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The feasibility study 
follows the assessment of the oil shale resource completed by an 
independent qualified resource evaluator, Millcreek Mining Group, in 
accordance with National Instrument 51-101 (Standards of Disclosure for 
Oil and Gas Activities) of the Canadian Securities Administrators and 
the Canadian oil and gas evaluation handbook. The resource assessment 
estimates a best estimate of discovered petroleum initially in place 
(DPIIP) of between 7.8 billion and 12.2 billion barrels. The resource 
assessment was prepared in accordance with NI 51-101 and the COGE 
handbook with an effective date of Oct. 1, 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DPIIP was the most 
specific assignable category of resources at the time of the resource 
assessment given the preliminary nature of the resource assessment and 
the nature of recovery of the hydrocarbons by means of mining and 
retorting and given that a program of work to determine commercial 
viability using established technology had not yet been completed. In 
addition, as a result of the preliminary nature of the resource 
assessment, it did not contain any estimates regarding the timing or 
cost to obtain commercial development. The accuracy of resource 
estimates is, in part, a function of the quality and quantity of 
available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and 
judgment. Given the data available at the time, the resource assessment 
was prepared, and the estimates presented therein are considered 
reasonable. The availability of additional data and analysis, after the 
date of the estimates, may necessitate revisions. These revisions may be
 material. There is no certainty that any portion of the resources will 
be discovered. If discovered, there is no certainty that it will be 
commercially viable to produce any portion of the resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more information, 
including without limitation a description of the Jordan oil shale 
project, the low and high estimates, and the significant positive and 
negative factors in respect of the resource estimates, please see the 
company's press release dated Oct. 27, 2016, and its annual information 
forms available on the company's website and at SEDAR.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">the verge of exempting future oilsands developments from its new environmental assessment standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rumours have it the feds will agree to let Alberta's own assessment standards take precedence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This would be a good 
thing. Even though our NDP's new assessment standards are too harsh, 
they are not as harsh as the ones being proposed by the Trudeau 
government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as nice as this new 
concession from the federal government would be, it's largely 
meaningless so long as the Trudeau government forges ahead with its new 
rules for pipeline construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This latest news has all 
the earmarks of a political trade-off: The federal Liberals will grant 
us permission to develop the oilsands (even though the constitution 
probably didn't require their permission in the first place), but they 
will deny us the pipelines we need to get our oil and bitumen to 
markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless and until the 
Trudeau government is prepared to withdraw its new assessment standards 
for major pipelines, the "victory" it will grant Alberta over the 
oilsands will be hollow, at best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should the exemption for 
oilsands developments be agreed to, expect a lot of clucking and crowing
 from the Alberta NDP government over how their carbon tax/Climate 
Leadership/"<b>social licence</b>" plan has paid off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Notley government 
will tell us the doubters were wrong; that Premier Rachel Notley's 
co-operation with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau DID work out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if we get only the 
oilsands concession and no change in proposed pipeline legislation, just
 what has the Alberta government achieved? We'll be able to mine bitumen
 and pump oil to our heart's content, but we won't be able to ship it 
anywhere, except (expensively and inefficiently) by rail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, lawyers 
studying Ottawa's new requirement that all future pipelines be subjected
 to a "genderbased analysis" confess to being confused by just how such 
an analysis would work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just how does "the 
intersection of sex and gender with other identity factors" impact 
pipelines? And, more importantly, how are pipeline companies supposed to
 prove to federal regulators that they have satisfied the gender-based 
tests? Pipeline builders already spend hundreds of millions surveying 
the impact of their projects on people, communities, water, animals, 
plants, even insects - yes, insects - along their proposed routes. But 
now federal approval might hinge on whether construction camps have 
enough female and "gender-diverse" workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if activists tell 
federal regulators they are worried the temporary presence of so many 
male workers will lead to more violence against local women or might 
increase the income gap between the sexes, that might prevent approval, 
too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trudeau government 
isn't backing away, either, from its insistence that Indigenous 
"traditional knowledge" be given equal standing with scientific research
 during the approval process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor is it weakening its 
requirement that pipeline companies account for all the upstream and 
downstream emissions of the products they carry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With all these new 
federal obstacles to pipelines - gender, Indigenous and environmental -

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta New 
Democrats'propaganda machine normally spits out about six to 10 grant 
announcements a week. But ever since last week's provincial budget, it 
has been in hyperdrive. Now it feels as if there are six or 10 
announcements a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Usually, this consists of
 a press release stating that the Northwest Central Yellowhead Business 
Development Office has received money for solar panels on its office 
roof, followed by NDP claims that this will help put back to work all 
those thousands of residents who have lost their jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this week, the magnitude and frequency of the spending news has been amped up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new school here (and there and there and there and there). A grant for <b>energy</b>-intensive
 businesses (to help pay for damage done by the NDP carbon tax). Money 
to clean the carpets and have yesteryear's flocked wallpaper replaced at
 the Northern and Southern Jubilee Auditoriums. A parkand-ride for St. 
Albert's transit commuters. A billion and a half for Edmonton transit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You may have noticed, 
too, that Premier Rachel Notley has been traipsing across the province 
throwing millions, hundreds of millions and billions around as if they 
weren't hers. (Oh, right. They aren't hers.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lots of people have 
wondered if this postbudget self-congratulations frenzy is a last-ditch 
effort by the New Dems to win re-election next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't think so. There's
 no chance the Notley government will win a second term. And I think 
they know that, too. (In unguarded, off-therecord moments, senior New 
Democrats will even admit their party stands almost no chance.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why this spending 
frenzy? The Notley government wants to go out in a blaze of glory. And 
if they can't convince Albertans to vote for them, they're at least 
going to force Albertans to pay for all the government caucus's lefty 
dreams before they're punted from office next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many New Democrats are still obsessed with the idea that Klein-era cuts created huge spending and infrastructure "deficits."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ralph hasn't been premier for more than 11 years. His government stopped making spending cuts nearly 20 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And by the time Klein's 
Tory party left office three years ago, it was spending more per capita 
than any other provincial government, with the possible exception of 
Newfoundland's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heck, today (March 29) is
 the fifth anniversary of Premier Klein's passing. To the extent there 
ever was a spending shortfall under Ralph, it vanished long ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, in a lot of New Dippers'minds, they continue to fight the victim-ofthe-week battles of 1993-94.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are 40 seats 
outside Edmonton and Calgary. The UCP should win 35 to 38, which leaves 
them needing between just six and nine from Alberta's two biggest cities
 to win a majority. They'll get twice that many in Calgary alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Notley NDP see this 
and have decided to buy, fund, build, borrow, slap together, trumpet, 
announce as many projects as they can before their time is up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New polling by <b>energy</b> research firm JWN shows just how unpopular the NDP are, especially among oil and gas executives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forty per cent of <b>energy</b>
 execs and managers give the Notley government an "F" on oil and gas; 
another quarter of respondents give them a "D." Just four percent give 
them an "A."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that's despite all of Notley's recent tough talk on pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The JWN poll also shows that an overwhelming 81 per cent think Notley's "<b>social licence</b>" experiment has utterly failed to get pipelines built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But here's a fun finding:
 While Notley gets an "F" from 40 per cent of oil and gas CEOs and 
investors, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Liberals get an "F" 
from 60 per cent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's New Democratic 
government introduced its 2018-19 budget last week, and it is likely to 
be a pivotal moment for the grand and indubitably noble cause of 
democratic socialism, or social democracy, or whatever we're calling it 
now, in Alberta. Our next provincial election is supposed to happen, by 
statute, next spring - "on or before" May 31. If that is how things pan 
out, the New Democrats will get to introduce, and in theory run behind, 
an election budget. But in the meantime, a full year of campaigning will
 have taken place, and will have been conducted on the basis of last 
week's budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the key themes 
will be carbon taxation. In arguments about the Alberta carbon tax, the 
design of the actual instrument has mostly been beside the point until 
now. The whole idea of taxing carbon, as such, strikes at the heart of 
Alberta's cultural self-identification: to many Albertans, raised on 
tales of Leduc No. 1 and the National <b>Energy</b> Program and the Heritage Fund, it is morally offensive in itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta is about 
hydrocarbons in sort of the same deep sense in which Quebec can be 
thought of as being "about" the French language. An Alberta carbon tax 
(a pioneering, world-leading one!) was always going to play, with large 
Alberta audiences, as an act of hysterical self-mortification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP had to know that 
there would be an inherent political price to be paid for its approach -
 that its carbon policy would, for some Albertans, be altogether beyond 
rational discussion. But nobody should underestimate the number of 
Albertans who are at the far opposite end of this spectrum - equally 
beyond reason in the other direction. A lot of Albertans hate that 
Alberta is about hydrocarbons: they go about in a state of constant 
low-level eco-spleen. Almost certainly the business of 
hydrocarbon-digging brought their parents here, or their grandparents, 
but they have grown up with endless propaganda about the species' 
planet-killing error of ever using fossil fuels, and they naturally feel
 trapped or swindled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP's carbon tax 
rhetoric was designed to appeal to those who lie between these two poles
 of irrationality. The United Conservatives have already spent a lot of 
time heckling the New Democrats over their implied promise that a carbon
 tax would provide <b>social licence</b> for pipeline projects that 
might help Alberta realize un-discounted world prices for ecologically 
laundered oil. The preferred rebuttal of carbon-tax advocates is that "<b>social licence</b>"
 is actually oil-industry jargon. But there can be no doubt that the 
carbon tax was designed, and politically marketed, on the basis of 
reputational benefits that have not yet panned out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta Finance Minister 
Joe Ceci hugs Premier Rachel Notley after delivering the 2018-19 budget 
in the Alberta Legislature on March 22.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Rachel Notley has talked a pretty good game about Alberta deserving to 
benefit from appropriately taxed carbon-grubbing, but the UCP can show 
that her caucus and her braintrust are full of former splenetics who 
used to wave handmade protest signs about Dirty Oil. The fallback 
argument, for the NDP, is that the carbon tax is a worthwhile incentive 
in itself. The point is not merely to hoover up new revenue, but simply 
to price, and thereby discourage, carbon pollution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be useful for 
the NDP to show, in making this argument, that the tax was wholly 
revenue-neutral - that it was not being used to increase the size of 
government, but was being given back to Albertans. The 2018-19 budget 
makes that part of the case more complicated for them. Under the new 
implied provincial price of $30 per ton of carbon emitted, the revenues 
from carbon taxation are expected to come to about $1.4 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only $525 million of that
 will be handed back to Alberta taxpayers directly, in rebate cheques to
 lower-income households. The government intends to spend more than 
what's left over from that revenue - over a billion dollars - on 
carbon-abatement projects under the Climate Leadership Plan. Close to 
half will go to public transit and other public infrastructure; over 
$200 million will be used to support coal towns being annihilated by the
 decarbonization of Alberta electricity; some of it will go to favoured 
"clean tech" researchers and businesses.</p>

 )</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New Democratic 
narrative will be that this should not really count as a tax grab, 
because the money, having most definitely been grabbed, is to be 
"reinvested" within Alberta. But if the most important point of the 
carbon tax was the price incentive, the NDP could have cut other taxes 
to make it truly revenue-neutral. It could even have provided a bigger, 
even more progressive cash rebate that wasn't a mere fraction of the 
revenue yield. (Mind you, I am aware of no leftist radical anywhere who 
is criticizing the Alberta carbon tax on this basis.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's worse, the federal
 government's umbrella carbon tax plan will increase the implied carbon 
price to $40 a ton in 2021, while passing the money along to Alberta, 
and the NDP's fiscal plan admits that, if it is still in charge, it will
 keep the additional money for use in "general revenue." If you're a 
middle-ground Albertan who is comfortable with a carbon tax as a 
concept, what do you have left to say to anyone who warned that such a 
tax could easily be increased, and might become another way of stiffing 
the taxpayer and increasing government expenditure? This is a surrender 
of moral high ground to essentially religious pro-carbon sentiment: 
those zanies, it seems, warned us of a millennium that is arriving fast.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Drew Cadenhead reports</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">PULSE OIL CORP</span>. ANNOUNCES PHASE 1 OF THE BIGORAY ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY PROJECT IS UNDERWAY + NEW WELL REACTIVATIONS TARGETING LIGHT OIL</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Pulse Oil Corp</span>. has initiated phase 1 of the Bigoray Nisku Pinnacle Reef enhanced oil recovery project in the Bigoray area of Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As previously announced on Jan. 9, 2018, and as summarized below, <span class="companylink">Sproule Associates Ltd</span>.,
 an independent qualified reserves evaluator, completed an independent 
resource assessment that includes the Bigoray EOR project potential 
only, and is in addition to the previously disclosed baseline 
independently assessed reserves in the company's core areas at Bigoray 
and Queenstown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sproule assessed a best 
estimate discovered petroleum initially in place (PIIP) of 23,292,000 
barrels of oil within Pulse's 100-per-cent-controlled Nisku D and Nisku E
 Pools, which Pulse views as conservative, given the Alberta Regulator 
lists PIIP as 26.51 million boe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resource assessment 
was prepared in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 -- Standards 
of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities of the Canadian Securities 
Administrators and the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulse also announces the 
appointment of a Bigoray EOR project manager, Bill Sawchuk, a 
professional petroleum engineer and an EOR expert to oversee all 
technical and planning aspects of the EOR program. Mr. Sawchuk has over 
20 years of experience as a senior engineering manager and a technical 
expert in reservoir engineering and enhanced oil recovery methods. Mr. 
Sawchuk has previously served as an exploitation engineer for Anderson 
Exploration Ltd. and <span class="companylink">Devon Canada Corp</span>.,
 and most recently, as manager of engineering for ARC Resources Ltd., 
where he led teams to optimize production and implement valuable 
enhanced oil recovery projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulse is excited that 
initial critical facility aspects of the Bigoray EOR project are now 
under way, using working capital on hand in preparation for the EOR 
injection phase to be implemented in 2018 as planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phase 1 of the EOR 
project, which includes reactivation of existing injection facilities, 
will also allow Pulse to cost-effectively reactivate up to three current
 shut-in oil producers to add approximately 400 barrels of oil 
equivalent per day (100-per-cent working interest) of new light oil and 
gas production prior to the EOR project taking place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Cadenhead, president
 and chief operating officer of Pulse Oil, commented: "We are eagerly 
awaiting the Bigoray EOR project to be fully under way later this year 
and the start of phase 1 is a very low-cost starting point; it's really 
exciting for everyone involved. This critical facility work not only 
marks the start of the EOR project for us, it allows us to get 
additional shut-in production reactivated in the near-term while we 
prepare for the water injection phase of the project in 2018. This 
interim production boost will provide additional revenues which will be 
reinvested in the Bigoray EOR program later this year as planned."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Independent resource assessment details</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sproule independent 
resource assessment provides estimates categorized as high, best and low
 for contingent resources associated with the Bigoray EOR project on the
 two pools, with the unrisked high estimate being 8.07 million boe (92.6
 per cent oil), a best estimate of 6.136 million boe (91.3 per cent oil)
 and a low estimate of 3.668 million boe (89.1 per cent oil).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, the 
resource assessment prepared by Sproule calculated risked contingent 
resources where the risked assessment assigned a 77-per-cent chance of 
Pulse proceeding with the EOR project and resulting in a best estimate 
of risked contingent resources net to Pulse of 4,694,000 boe (91.2 per 
cent oil).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cadenhead commented: 
"The Sproule resource assessment is a positive independent commercial 
confirmation for our Bigoray Nisku enhanced oil recovery project. 
Although this assessment used a more conservative approach to petroleum 
initially in place compared with the PIIP estimates of the Alberta <b>energy</b>
 regulator, we are excited to see that even this more conservative 
approach resulted in a strong endorsement for the project. With an 
independent unrisked high-case upside estimated at over eight million 
boe of contingent resources (92 per cent oil), the opportunity to move 
forward with our EOR project to bring on stream substantial cash flow 
while targeting to recover those types of oil volumes without drilling a
 well, creates a substantial opportunity to enhance value for Pulse and 
our shareholders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resource assessment 
focused exclusively on two Nisku pools only in the Bigoray area, and 
included just 2,720 acres of Pulse's 44,720-acre core area holdings 
which includes 14,000 acres at Bigoray alone. Future evaluations may be 
done on Pulse's Mannville, Cardium and Pekisko formations that are 
thought to also provide significant growth opportunities for the company
 as well as additional Nisku assets/pools held within Pulse's existing 
holdings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cadenhead further 
added: "As part of the resource assessment, the evaluator assessed a 
total risk of 77 per cent that the project would proceed, citing 
economic factors and/or timing of development as one of the only risks 
associated with the project. All technical risks such as evaluation 
drilling, regulatory approvals, technology, legal factors, 
infrastructure and markets, political factors, and <b>social licence</b>
 were all assigned 100 per cent chance of commerciality. Our goal is to 
make this project happen in 2018 and with the oil prices holding firmly 
above $60 (U.S.) WTI pricing, the economics of this EOR project and 
return for shareholders continue to look more and more attractive 
alongside improving oil prices."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resource assessment 
is based on the results from 17 wells and, where available, core data. 
Where core was not available, the assessment considered log data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent resource 
volumes for these discovered resources have been classified as 
"development unclarified" with Sproule assessing that there is a high 
probability of the Bigoray EOR project becoming a commercial 
development. Pulse will continue to complete project planning associated
 with the project and move forward with its execution plans in 2018.</p>

Mr. Ian Pearce reports</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW GOLD ANNOUNCES CHANGES TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">New Gold Inc</span>. is providing an update on
 the pending retirement of four directors, Vahan Kololian, Martyn Konig,
 Randall Oliphant and Kay Priestly, as well as the nomination of two new
 independent directors, Dr. Gillian Davidson and Peggy Mulligan. Over 
all, the changes result in the planned reduction in the size of the 
board from nine to seven members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Board retirements</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's announcement 
reflects the culmination of a thoughtful and deliberate process 
initiated by the board. The process was informed by the evolving needs 
and strategy of the company, the board's own self-evaluation, and New 
Gold's commitment to corporate governance best practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The board of New Gold 
began a renewal process in 2017, with the appointment of Ian Pearce as 
chair and the addition of Marilyn Schonberner. Mr. Kololian, Mr. Konig 
and Mr. Oliphant have each served on the board for nine years (in 
addition to serving as directors of one of the company's predecessors, <span class="companylink">Western Goldfields Inc</span>.)
 and are not standing for re-election in order to facilitate the board 
renewal process. Ms. Priestly, who has been a director since 2015, will 
also not be standing for re-election due to her other commitments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are grateful for the 
wealth of experience and dedication that Vahan, Martyn, Randall and Kay 
have brought to the board. They have provided sound, thoughtful guidance
 that has been instrumental to both overcoming the challenges and 
seizing the opportunities at New Gold during their tenure," stated Mr. 
Pearce. "On behalf of the entire company, I would like to thank them for
 their many contributions which will serve as the foundation for the 
company's further growth and success."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Board nominations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building on the 
retirements from the board, two highly qualified, independent candidates
 for the board will be nominated for election at the 2018 annual general
 meeting. Dr. Davidson and Ms. Mulligan bring significant global 
experience in social and environmental sustainability, audit, and 
finance to New Gold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Biographies of nominated directors</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Gillian Davidson</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peggy Mulligan</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Mulligan has over 35 
years of experience in audit and finance. From 2008 to 2010, Ms. 
Mulligan was the executive vice-president and chief financial officer of
 Biovail Corp. and from 2005 to 2007 she was the executive 
vice-president and chief financial officer of Linamar Corp. From 1994 to

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The board renewal process
 has also included a review and assessment of the optimal size of the 
board as determined by the current needs of the company. Ian Pearce, 
James Estey, Marilyn Schonberner, Raymond Threlkeld, and Hannes 
Portmann, president and chief executive officer, will stand for 
re-election to the board, providing continuity and the benefit of 
company and industry knowledge and experience. Given the diverse skills 
and experience of the continuing and proposed board members, it was 
concluded that the board would be most efficient and effective if the 
number of seats were reduced from nine to seven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following the proposed 
changes to the board which are to be confirmed at the 2018 annual 
general meeting, five of the seven New Gold board members will be

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY, March 26, 2018 /CNW/ - <span class="companylink">Pulse Oil Corp</span>.
 ("Pulse" or the "Company") (TSX-V: PUL and PUL.WT) reports today that 
Pulse has initiated Phase 1 of the Bigoray Nisku Pinnacle Reef Enhanced 
Oil Recovery ("EOR") project in the Bigoray area of Alberta ("Bigoray").</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As previously announced on January 9, 2018, and as summarized below, <span class="companylink">Sproule Associates Limited</span>
 ("Sproule"), an independent qualified reserves evaluator, completed an 
independent resource assessment that includes the Bigoray EOR project 
potential only, and is in addition to the previously disclosed baseline 
independently assessed reserves in the Company's core areas at Bigoray 
and Queenstown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sproule assessed a best 
estimate Discovered Petroleum Initially in-Place (PIIP) of 23.292 
million barrels of oil ("boe") within Pulse's 100% controlled Nisku D 
and Nisku E Pools, which Pulse views as conservative, given the Alberta 
Regulator lists PIIP as 26.51 million boe's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Resource Assessment 
was prepared in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 –Standards of
 Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities&nbsp;of the Canadian Securities 
Administrators ("NI 51-101") and the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation 
Handbook ("COGE Handbook").</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more information on the Sproule independent resource assessment, please see "Independent Resource Assessment Details" below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulse also announces the 
appointment of a Bigoray EOR Project Manager, Bill Sawchuk, a 
Professional Petroleum Engineer and an EOR expert to oversee all 
technical and planning aspects of the EOR program. With over 20 years 
of&nbsp;experience as a senior engineering manager and a technical 
expert in reservoir engineering and enhanced oil recovery methods. Bill 
has previously served as an Exploitation Engineer for Anderson 
Exploration Ltd. and <span class="companylink">Devon Canada Corporation</span>
 and most recently, as Manager of Engineering for ARC Resources Ltd. 
where he led teams to optimize production and implement valuable 
Enhanced Oil Recovery projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulse is excited that 
initial critical facility aspects of the Bigoray EOR project are now 
underway, using working capital on hand in preparation for the EOR 
Injection Phase to be implemented in 2018 as planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phase 1 of the EOR 
project ("Phase 1"), which includes re-activation of existing injection 
facilities, will also allow Pulse to cost-effectively reactivate up to 3
 current shut-in oil producers to add approximately 400 BOE/d (100% 
working interest) of new light oil and gas production prior to the EOR 
project taking place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Cadenhead, President
 and COO of Pulse Oil, commented, "We are eagerly awaiting the Bigoray 
EOR project to be fully underway later this year and the start of Phase 1
 is a very low-cost starting point; it's really exciting for everyone 
involved.&nbsp; This critical facility work not only marks the start of 
the EOR project for us, it allows us to get additional shut-in 
production re-activated in the near-term while we prepare for the water 
injection phase of the project in 2018. This interim production boost 
will provide additional revenues which will be reinvested in the Bigoray
 EOR program later this year as planned."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Independent Resource Assessment Details:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sproule Independent 
Resource Assessment provides estimates categorized as "high", "best" and
 "low" for contingent resources associated with the Bigoray EOR project 
on the two pools, with the unrisked high estimate being 8.07 million boe
 (92.6% Oil), a best estimate of 6.136 million boe (91.3% Oil) and a low
 estimate of 3.668 million boe (89.1% Oil).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, the 
Resource Assessment prepared by Sproule calculated risked contingent 
resources where the risked assessment assigned a 77% chance of Pulse 
proceeding with the EOR project (see Table 2 below) and resulting in a 
best estimate of risked contingent resources net to Pulse of 4.694 
million boe (91.2% Oil).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Cadenhead, President
 and COO of Pulse Oil, commented, "The Sproule Resource Assessment is a 
positive independent commercial confirmation for our Bigoray Nisku 
Enhanced Oil Recovery project. Although this assessment used a more 
conservative approach to Petroleum Initially in-Place ("PIIP") compared 
with the PIIP estimates of the Alberta <b>Energy</b> Regulator, we are 
excited to see that even this more conservative approach resulted in a 
strong endorsement for the project. With an independent un-risked high 
case upside estimated at over 8 million boe's of contingent resources 
(92% oil), the opportunity to move forward with our EOR project to bring
 on stream substantial cashflow while targeting to recover those types 
of oil volumes without drilling a well, creates a substantial 
opportunity to enhance value for Pulse and our shareholders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Resource Assessment 
focussed exclusively on two Nisku pools only in the Bigoray area, and 
included just 2,720 acres of Pulse's 44,720 acre core area holdings 
which includes 14,000 acres at Bigoray alone. Future evaluations may be 
done on Pulse's Mannville, Cardium and Pekisko formations that are 
thought to also provide significant growth opportunities for the Company
 as well as additional Nisku assets/pools held within Pulse's existing 
holdings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cadenhead further 
added, "As part of the Resource Assessment, the evaluator assessed a 
total risk of 77% that the project would proceed, citing economic 
factors and/or timing of development as one of the only risks associated
 with the project. All technical risks such as&nbsp;evaluation drilling,
 regulatory approvals, technology, legal factors, infrastructure and 
markets, political factors and <b>social licence</b> were all assigned 
100% chance of commerciality.&nbsp;Our goal is to make this project 
happen in 2018 and with the oil prices holding firmly above US$60 WTI 
pricing, the economics of this EOR project and return for shareholders 
continue to look more and more attractive alongside improving oil 
prices." &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Resource Assessment 
is based on the results from seventeen wells and, where available, core 
data. Where core was not available, the assessment considered log data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resource 
volumes for these discovered resources have been classified as 
'development unclarified' with Sproule assessing that there is a high 
probability of the Bigoray EOR project becoming a commercial 
development. Pulse will continue to complete project planning associated
 with the project and move forward with its execution plans in 
2018.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resources encompasses all
 petroleum quantities that originally existed on or within the earth's 
crust in naturally occurring accumulations, including Discovered and 
Undiscovered (recoverable and unrecoverable) plus quantities already 
produced. "Total Resources" is equivalent to "Total Petroleum Initially 
In-Place". Resources are classified in the following categories:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total Petroleum Initially
 In-Place ("TPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is estimated to 
exist originally in naturally occurring accumulations. It includes that 
quantity of petroleum that is estimated, as of a given date, to be 
contained in known accumulations, prior to production, plus those 
estimated quantities in accumulations yet to be discovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovered Petroleum 
Initially In-Place ("DPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is 
estimated, as of a given date, to be contained in known accumulations 
prior to production. The recoverable portion of DPIIP includes 
production, reserves, and Contingent Resources; the remainder is 
unrecoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent Resources are 
those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established 
technology or technology under development but which are not currently 
considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more 
contingencies. Economic Contingent Resources (ECR) are those contingent 
resources that are currently economically recoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undiscovered Petroleum 
Initially In Place ("UPIIP") is that quantity of petroleum that is 
estimated, on a given date, to be contained in accumulations yet to be 
discovered. The recoverable portion of UPIIP is referred to as 
Prospective Resources and the remainder is unrecoverable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective Resources are
 those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application 
of future development projects. Prospective Resources have both an 
associated chance of discovery and a chance of development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unrecoverable is that 
portion of DPIIP and UPIIP quantities which is estimated, as of a given 
date, not to be recoverable by future development projects. A portion of
 these quantities may become recoverable in the future as commercial 
circumstances change or technological developments occur; the remaining 
portion may never be recovered due to the physical/chemical constraints 
represented by subsurface interaction of fluids and reservoir rocks. 
Uncertainty Ranges are described by the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation 
Handbook as low, best, and high estimates for reserves and resources as 
follows:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low Estimate: This is 
considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities
 recovered will exceed the low estimate. If probabilistic methods are 
used, there should be at least a 90 percent probability (P90) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the low estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best Estimate: This is 
considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will actually be
 recovered. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities 
recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate. If 
probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50 percent 
probability (P50) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or 
exceed the best estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High Estimate: This is 
considered to be an optimistic estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual remaining 
quantities recovered will exceed the high estimate. If probabilistic 
methods are used, there should be at least a 10 percent probability 
(P10) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the 
high estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development Unclarified 
is a project maturity sub-class of contingent resources that refers to 
the development plan evaluation is not complete and there is ongoing 
activity to resolve any risks or uncertainties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certain resource estimate
 volumes disclosed herein are arithmetic sums of multiple estimates of 
DPIIP or UPIIP, which statistical principles indicate may be misleading 
as to volumes that may actually be recovered. Readers should give 
attention to the estimates of individual classes of resources and 
appreciate the differing probabilities of recovery associated with each 
class as explained under this&nbsp;Resource Definitions&nbsp;section.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- La India open pit was 
redesigned to avoid resettlement and a corresponding amendment to the 
environmental and social impact assessment, which forms a key part of 
the application for the environmental permit, was submitted to the 
Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Redesigned open pit is 
not expected to materially alter a prefeasibility study open-pit gold 
mineral reserve in the probable category of 6.9 million tonnes at 3.0 
g/t gold for 675,000 ounces gold, producing 80,000 ounces gold per annum
 for seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chairman's statement for the year ended Dec. 31, 2017</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chairman and chief executive officer Mark Child said: "I am pleased to announce <span class="companylink">Condor Gold PLC</span>'s
 annual report for the 12-month financial year to Dec. 31, 2017. 
Following the release in December, 2014, of a National Instrument 43-101
 technical report detailing a prefeasibility study (PFS) and two 
preliminary economic assessments (PEAs), the company spent 2015, 2016 
and 2017 executing a twin strategy of permitting the construction and 
operation of a base case processing plant with capacity of up to 2,800 
tonnes per day (tpd) capable of producing approximately 100,000 ounces 
gold per annum and proving a major gold district at the 
313-square-kilometre La India project, Nicaragua.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In November, 2015, <span class="companylink">Condor</span>
 formally submitted a 700-page environmental and social impact 
assessment (ESIA) document, applying for an environmental permit to the 
Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources, Nicaragua (MARENA), 
for the construction and operation of an open-pit mine, a 2,800 tpd or 
one-million-tonne-per-annum (tpa) CIL [carbon in leach] processing plant
 and associated infrastructure at the La India project. The application 
envisaged the resettlement of approximately 330 houses or 1,000 people. 
The community resettlement combined with presidential and mayoral 
elections has been the reason the permit has been delayed 18 months. 
Over all, the government of Nicaragua has been supportive of <span class="companylink">Condor</span> building a new mine at the historic Mina La India.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"On Feb. 26, 2018, <span class="companylink">Condor</span>
 announced that it had formally submitted a 130-page amendment to the 
ESIA to MARENA, to construct and operate a processing plant without the 
need to resettle approximately 330 houses or 1,000 people. This followed
 several months of discussions and collaborative meetings with MARENA 
and the Ministry of <b>Energy</b> and Mines (MEM), such that the 
technical components within the amended ESIA required by both ministries
 were agreed in advance and submitted in the final amended application.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The general feedback 
from MEM, MARENA and local stakeholders has been that permitting will be
 much easier now that the mine has been redesigned to proceed without 
resettling 1,000 people. <span class="companylink">Condor</span>'s 
technical team has redesigned La India open pit and believe it is both 
technically viable and economically attractive, should future funding be
 received, to proceed with a redesigned open pit that does not require 
community resettlement. It includes the relocation of the processing 
plant approximately 1,200 metres from the village. A five-metre-high 
berm is planned between the redesigned open pit and the village to 
reduce noise and dust pollution. Mine scheduling studies are ongoing, 
and further details will be provided in due course. <span class="companylink">Condor</span>
 does not anticipate a material change in the total ounces of gold 
expected to be recoverable from the redesigned open pit compared to the 
open pit disclosed in the PFS. The PFS details an open-pit gold mineral 
reserve in the probable category of 6.9 million tonnes at 3.0 g/t gold 
for 675,000 ounces gold, producing 80,000 ounces gold per annum for 
seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The revised ESIA 
document considers the environmental and social impacts of gold 
production from the La India open-pit mine plan, which is a single pit, 
detailed in the NI 43-101-compliant PFS released in December, 2014, and 
the Whittle Enterprise optimization study which was finalized on Jan. 
22, 2016. The ESIA draws on data from 15 different environmental and 
social baseline studies, some of which commenced in 2013. In addition to
 describing the potential impacts of a future commercial mine on the 
environment, the ESIA also contains detailed environmental management 
plans and social management plans to monitor and control any such 
impacts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The ESIA describes a 
processing plant that will have a capacity of up to 2,800 tpd 1.0 
million tpa with an upfront capital cost of approximately $120-million 
(U.S.). All-in sustaining cash costs are circa $700 (U.S.) per ounces 
gold. The ESIA includes processing of an additional 10,000 ounces of 
gold per annum from artisanal miners through the main processing plant, 
but the artisanal miners' ore is excluded from the PFS, PEAs and 
optimization studies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"During 2017, SRK 
Consulting (U.K.) Ltd. completed two scoping-level studies each aimed at
 examining the likely production scenarios in the event that the mineral
 resource in the three main vein sets of La India, America and Mestiza 
is increased from 2.1 million ounces gold to three million ounces gold. 
The studies conclude that the three vein sets could be mined 
simultaneously from a combination of open pit and underground mining 
methods and possibly double the annual production rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"<span class="companylink">Condor</span>
 has been working on a land acquisition program for over four years and 
plans to acquire approximately 600 hectares of rural land for the 
production scenario in the PFS. ProNicaragua is assisting with a cleanup
 of land titles. During 2017, the company purchased 150 hectares of 
rural land. Two independent valuations have been conducted and a 
strategy is being implemented to secure the rural land by paying 10 per 
cent of the purchase price of land to landowners, who grant <span class="companylink">Condor</span>
 an option to purchase the rural land for a two-year period. Offers to 
purchase the land have been made to all landowners; at the time of 
writing 30 per cent have accepted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Exploration activities 
during 2017 followed a dual approach of exploration or scout drilling 
which targeted new areas within the La India project and regional 
exploration, primarily focused on identifying targets for hidden 
deep-seated gold mineralization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"On March 31, 2017, <span class="companylink">Condor</span>
 commenced an initial 2,000 m drilling program on Mestiza to test the 
historic Soviet mineral resource and went on to complete almost 6,000 m 
drilling on Mestiza by August, 2017. The aim was to convert the upper 
portion of the Soviet mineral resource to a[n] NI 43-101-standard 
inferred mineral resource. This is significant for four reasons:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- "Soviet-backed drilling
 in 1991 supported a Soviet-style mineral resource of 2,392,000 tonnes 
at 10.2 g/t gold for 785,694 ounces gold at Mestiza. Note that the 
company is not treating this historical estimate as current mineral 
resources or mineral reserves. It is superseded by the mineral resources
 reported herein. <span class="companylink">Condor</span> has used the 
Soviet data, and subsequent drilling undertaken by Canadian companies, 
to plan a drill program to convert the upper portion of the Soviet 
resource to Western standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- "Mestiza already hosts 
a[n] NI 43-101-compliant inferred mineral resource of 1.49 million 
tonnes at 7.47 g/t for 333,000 ounces gold. However, this is excluded 
from the current PFS and PEA studies at the La India project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- "There is a high 
possibility of bringing additional high-grade gold ore from Mestiza into
 a future mine plan, feeding a centralized processing plant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- "There is the possibility of a third feeder pit on Mestiza.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Mestiza vein set is 
excluded from the PFS. It is encouraging that Micon International's 1998
 report on the Espinito-Mendoza concession concluded that the property 
has good potential to become a small (500 to 800 tpd), low-cost mine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In April, 2017, <span class="companylink">Condor</span>
 completed a regional soil geochemistry survey designed to look for 
high-level, epithermal pathfinder elements above hidden deep-seated 
epithermal gold mineralization. Following the 71-square-kilometre 
multielement soil survey carried out in 2015 a further 109 square 
kilometres [were] completed in 2016, with the balance of the entire 313 
square kilometres of the La India project concession package completed 
by April, 2017. The interpretation of the soil geochemistry, in 
conjunction with the field mapping, has highlighted several areas for 
follow-up exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The <span class="companylink">International Finance Corp</span>. (<span class="companylink">IFC</span>), the private sector investment body of the <span class="companylink">World Bank</span>, was a 7.33-per-cent shareholder in the company at Dec. 31, 2017. <span class="companylink">Condor</span> is committed to complying with <span class="companylink">IFC</span> performance standards, which are an international benchmark for identifying and managing environmental and social risk. <span class="companylink">Condor</span>
 has put considerable time and effort into fulfilling the requirements 
of an environmental social action plan (ESAP), which was agreed to with 
the <span class="companylink">IFC</span> as part of their investment process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"La India project has now
 met the conditions of the agreed ESAP. The company's fulfilment of the 
ESAP items, to the satisfaction of the <span class="companylink">IFC</span>,
 is establishing the basis for the sustainability of a future mine at 
the La India project, whose development is subject to obtaining all 
required permits and compliance with <span class="companylink">IFC</span> performance standards applicable to that stage. Implementation of the <span class="companylink">IFC</span> performance standards help <span class="companylink">Condor</span>
 manage and improve our environmental and social performance through an 
outcomes-based approach and also provide a solid base from which the 
company may increase the sustainability of its business operations and 
provides benefits for all shareholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In October, 2017, Aiser Sarria joined <span class="companylink">Condor</span> Gold as general manager, Mina La India. Mr. Sarria joins <span class="companylink">Condor</span> from <span class="companylink">B2Gold</span>
 where he was projects and mine superintendent at El Limon mine, which 
is only 35 miles away from La India project. He has the relevant 
experience of open-pit and underground mining to progress Mina La India 
through permitting, additional technical studies and construction. In 
November, 2017, Jeffrey Karoly joined <span class="companylink">Condor</span>
 Gold as chief financial officer. Mr. Karoly has extensive experience at
 chief financial officer level in listed companies, with a particular 
focus on South America since spending time there with <span class="companylink">Anglo American</span>.
 He has first-hand experience of maintaining AIM/TSX [Alternative 
Investment Market/Toronto Stock Exchange] dual listings and was 
instrumental in <span class="companylink">Condor</span>'s dual listing on the TSX in January, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Turning to the financial
 results for the year 2017, the loss for the year was 3,023,615 British 
pounds (2016: 7,682,231 British pounds). The company raised 5,242,000 
British pounds during the financial period. The increase in cash and 
cash equivalents over the year was 362,651 British pounds (2016: 
increase of 141,900 British pounds). The net cash balance at Dec. 31, 
2017, was 946,261 British pounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In 2017, the company 
announced it had raised 5,242,000 British pounds by way of a private 
placement of 8,454,733 new ordinary shares at a placement price of 62 
pence. A one-half warrant, which is unlisted, was attached to each 
placement share. A total of 4,227,364 warrants were issued with an 
exercise price of 93 pence and a two-year life. If exercised in full, 
the warrants would raise gross proceeds of 3,931,449 British pounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The twin strategy for 
2018 remains to obtain the environmental permit for a base case of a 
2,800 tpd processing plant for a single open pit at La India, with the 
capacity to produce approximately 100,000 ounces gold per annum and to 
demonstrate a major gold district at La India project. On the grant of 
the permits, <span class="companylink">Condor</span> envisages a 
12-month study period followed by an 18- to 24-month construction 
period. During the 12-month study period, subject to funding, the 
company has exploration drill plans targeted to add one million ounces 
of gold to the global mineral resource through extensions to known 
mineralization and determine whether feeder pits can be added to the PFS
 as well as progress the main La India open pit from PFS to FS."</p>

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENTFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dear Shareholder,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am pleased to announce <span class="companylink">Condor Gold Plc</span>’s (“<span class="companylink">Condor</span>”
 or “the Company” or “the Group”, 
www.condorgold.com[https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=neLksGzevtClYlawQil2RfpItD2H1JYZy--xKhwqVourVqcHM11A_Dy5-5LDKDje3kzVvUDStRsDHiJtW99kpqY0W-TE-WzAj47B9Ka3cBo=])
 annual report for the 12-month financial year to 31 December 2017. 
Following the release in December 2014 of a NI 43-101 technical report 
detailing a Pre-Feasibility Study (“PFS”) and two Preliminary Economic 
Assessments (“PEAs”), the Company spent 2015, 2016 and 2017 executing a 
twin strategy of permitting the construction and operation of a base 
case processing plant with capacity of up to 2,800 tonnes per day 
(“tpd”) capable of producing approximately 100,000 oz gold per annum and
 proving a major Gold District at the 313km² La India Project, 
Nicaragua.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November 2015, <span class="companylink">Condor</span>
 formally submitted a 700-page Environmental and Social Impact 
Assessment (“ESIA”) document, applying for an Environmental Permit to 
the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources, Nicaragua 
(“MARENA”) for the construction and operation of an open pit mine, a 
2,800 tpd or 1 million tonnes per annum (“tpa”) CIL processing plant and
 associated infrastructure at the La India Project. The application 
envisaged the resettlement of approximately 330 houses or 1,000 people. 
The community resettlement combined with Presidential and Mayoral 
elections has been the reason the permit has been delayed 18 months. 
Overall, the Government of Nicaragua has been supportive of <span class="companylink">Condor</span> building a new mine at the historic Mina La India.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On 26 February 2018, <span class="companylink">Condor</span>
 announced that it had formally submitted a 130 page amendment to the 
ESIA to MARENA, to construct and operate a processing plant without the 
need to resettle approximately 330 houses or 1,000 people. This followed
 several months of discussions and collaborative meetings with MARENA 
and the Ministry of <b>Energy</b> and Mines (“MEM”), such that the 
technical components within the amended ESIA required by both Ministries
 were agreed in advance and submitted in the final amended application.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The general feedback from
 MEM, MARENA and local stakeholders has been that permitting will be 
much easier now that the mine has been redesigned to proceed without 
resettling 1,000 people. <span class="companylink">Condor</span>’s 
technical team has redesigned La India open pit and believe it is both 
technically viable and economically attractive, should future funding be
 received, to proceed with a redesigned open pit that does not require 
community resettlement. It includes the relocation of the processing 
plant approximately 1,200 metres from the village. A 5 metre high berm 
is planned between the redesigned open pit and the village to reduce 
noise and dust pollution. Mine scheduling studies are on-going, and 
further details will be provided in due course. <span class="companylink">Condor</span>
 does not anticipate a material change in the total ounces of gold 
expected to be recoverable from the redesigned open pit compared to the 
open pit disclosed in the PFS. The PFS details an open pit gold mineral 
reserve in the Probable category of 6.9 Mt at 3.0 g/t gold for 675,000 
oz gold, producing 80,000 oz gold per annum for seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The revised ESIA document
 considers the environmental and social impacts of gold production from 
the La India Open Pit mine plan, which is a single pit, detailed in the 
NI 43-101 compliant PFS released in December 2014 and the Whittle 
Enterprise Optimisation study which was finalised on 22 January 2016. 
The ESIA draws on data from 15 different environmental and social 
baseline studies, some of which commenced in 2013. In addition to 
describing the potential impacts of a future commercial mine on the 
environment, the ESIA also contains detailed environmental management 
plans and social management plans to monitor and control any such 
impacts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ESIA describes a 
processing plant that will have a capacity of up to 2,800 tpd 1.0 
million tpa with an upfront capital cost of approximately US$120M. 
All-in-sustaining-cash-costs are circa US$700 per oz gold. The ESIA 
includes processing of an additional 10,000oz of gold p.a. from 
artisanal miners through the main processing plant, but the artisanal 
miners’ ore is excluded from the PFS, PEAs and Optimisation Studies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During 2017, SRK 
Consulting (UK) Ltd. completed two scoping level studies each aimed at 
examining the likely production scenarios in the event that the mineral 
resource in the 3 main vein sets of La India, America and Mestiza is 
increased from 2.1M oz gold to <span class="companylink">3M</span> oz 
gold. The studies conclude that the 3 vein sets could be mined 
simultaneously from a combination of open pit and underground mining 
methods and possibly double the annual production rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Condor</span> has been working on a land 
acquisition programme for over 4 years and plans to acquire 
approximately 600 hectares of rural land for the production scenario in 
the PFS. ProNicaragua is assisting with a clean up of land titles. 
During 2017, the Company purchased 150 hectares of rural land. Two 
independent valuations have been conducted and a strategy is being 
implemented to secure the rural land by paying 10% of the purchase price
 of land to landowners, who grant <span class="companylink">Condor</span>
 an option to purchase the rural land for a two-year period. Offers to 
purchase the land have been made to all landowners; at the time of 
writing 30% have accepted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exploration activities 
during 2017 followed a dual approach of exploration or scout drilling 
which targeted new areas within the La India Project and regional 
exploration, primarily focussed on identifying targets for hidden 
deep-seated gold mineralisation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On 31st March 2017, <span class="companylink">Condor</span>
 commenced an initial 2,000m drilling programme on Mestiza to test the 
historic Soviet mineral resource and went on to complete almost 6,000m 
drilling on Mestiza by August 2017. The aim was to convert the upper 
portion of the Soviet mineral resource to a NI 43-101-standard Inferred 
Mineral Resource. This is significant for four reasons:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Soviet-backed drilling 
in 1991 supported a Soviet-style mineral resource of 2,392kt at 10.2 g/t
 gold for 785,694oz gold at Mestiza. Note that the Company is not 
treating this historical estimate as current mineral resources or 
mineral reserves. It is superseded by the mineral resources reported 
herein. <span class="companylink">Condor</span> has used the Soviet 
data, and subsequent drilling undertaken by Canadian companies, to plan a
 drill programme to convert the upper portion of the Soviet resource to 
Western standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Mestiza already hosts a
 NI 43-101-compliant Inferred Mineral Resource of 1,490kt at 7.47g/t for
 333,000oz gold. However, this is excluded from the current PFS and PEA 
Studies at the La India Project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* There is a high 
possibility of bringing additional high grade gold ore from Mestiza into
 a future mine plan, feeding a centralised processing plant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* There is the 
possibility of a third feeder pit on Mestiza. The Mestiza Vein Set is 
excluded from the PFS. It is encouraging that Micon International’s 1998
 report on the Espinito-Mendoza Concession concluded that the property 
has good potential to become a small (500 to 800tpd), low cost mine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April 2017, <span class="companylink">Condor</span>
 completed a regional soil geochemistry survey designed to look for 
high-level, epithermal pathfinder elements above hidden deep-seated 
epithermal gold mineralisation. Following the 71km² multi-element soil 
survey carried out in 2015 a further 109km² was completed in 2016, with 
the balance of the entire 313km² of the La India Project concession 
package completed by April 2017. The interpretation of the soil 
geochemistry, in conjunction with the field mapping, has highlighted 
several areas for follow up exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">International Finance Corporation</span> (“<span class="companylink">IFC</span>”), the private sector investment body of the <span class="companylink">World Bank</span>, was a 7.33% shareholder in the Company at 31st December 2017. <span class="companylink">Condor</span> is committed to complying with <span class="companylink">IFC</span> Performance Standards, which are an international benchmark for identifying and managing environmental and social risk. <span class="companylink">Condor</span>
 has put considerable time and effort into fulfilling the requirements 
of an Environmental Social Action Plan (ESAP), which was agreed to with 
the <span class="companylink">IFC</span> as part of their investment process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">La India Project has now 
met the conditions of the agreed ESAP. The Company’s fulfilment of the 
ESAP items, to the satisfaction of the <span class="companylink">IFC</span>,
 is establishing the basis for the sustainability of a future mine at 
the La India Project, whose development is subject to obtaining all 
required permits and compliance with <span class="companylink">IFC</span> performance standards applicable to that stage. Implementation of the <span class="companylink">IFC</span> Performance Standards help <span class="companylink">Condor</span>
 manage and improve our environmental and social performance through an 
outcomes-based approach and also provide a solid base from which the 
company may increase the sustainability of its business operations and 
provides benefits for all shareholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October 2017, Mr Aiser Sarria joined <span class="companylink">Condor</span> Gold as General Manager, Mina La India. Mr Sarria joins <span class="companylink">Condor</span> from <span class="companylink">B2Gold</span>
 where he was Projects and Mine Superintendent at El Limon Mine, which 
is only 35 miles away from La India Project. He has the relevant 
experience of open pit and underground mining to progress Mina La India 
through permitting, additional technical studies and construction. In 
November 2017, Mr Jeffrey Karoly joined <span class="companylink">Condor</span>
 Gold as Chief Financial Officer. Mr Karoly has extensive experience at 
CFO-level in listed companies, with a particular focus on South America 
since spending time there with <span class="companylink">Anglo American</span>. He has first-hand experience of maintaining AIM/TSX dual listings and was instrumental in <span class="companylink">Condor</span>’s dual listing on the TSX in January 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Turning to the financial 
results for the year 2017, the loss for the year was £3,023,615 
(2016:£7,682,231). The Company raised £5.242 million during the 
financial period. The increase in cash and cash equivalents over the 
year was £362,651 (2016: increase of £141,900). The net cash balance at 
31st December 2017 was £946,261</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2017, the Company 
announced it had raised £5.242m by way of a private placement of 
8,454,733 new ordinary shares at a placement price of 62 pence. A 
one-half warrant, which is unlisted, was attached to each placement 
share. A total of 4,227,364 warrants were issued with an exercise price 
of 93 pence and a 2 year life. If exercised in full, the warrants would 
raise gross proceeds of £3,931,449</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The twin strategy for 
2018 remains to obtain the Environmental Permit for a base case of a 
2,800tpd processing plant for a single open pit at La India, with the 
capacity to produce approximately 100,000oz gold per annum and to 
demonstrate a major Gold District at La India Project. On the grant of 
the permits, <span class="companylink">Condor</span> envisages a 12 
month study period followed by an 18 to 24 month construction period. 
During the 12 month study period, subject to funding, the Company has 
exploration drill plans targeted to add 1million ounces of gold to the 
global mineral resource through extensions to known mineralisation and 
determine whether feeder pits can be added to the PFS as well as 
progress the main La India open pit from PFS to FS.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The throne speech that 
marked the opening of the legislature earlier this month was clearly 
aimed at more than just Albertans. One of its key themes was the need to
 get our oil to tidewater, where it will fetch a higher price than fuel 
sold to the United States, which is where the great majority of our <b>energy</b> is exported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The speech, read by 
Lt.-Gov. Lois Mitchell, had British Columbians in mind; in particular, 
Premier John Horgan, who has voiced strong opposition to the Trans 
Mountain pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The dispute British 
Columbia triggered with its attack on Canadian workers will not stand," 
the government said in the speech. "We won't let it. We have been 
vigilant in defending our workers and we will remain vigilant."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a well-crafted 
message, but when the government's budget is released Thursday 
afternoon, the Rachel Notley government must ensure Albertans'interests 
are at the heart of its fiscal blueprint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since coming to power in 
2015, the NPD has posted irresponsible deficits. Its predecessor, the 
Conservative party, also failed to balance the books under successive 
premiers, but there was nothing like the NDP has done in the supposed 
defence of front-line services such as health care and education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP has spent 
taxpayer money with abandon, to the point that credit agencies, which 
determine how much Albertans will pay in interest on the massive amount 
of borrowing, have downgraded the province's rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP is clearly an 
ally of the organized labour movement, but it needs to expand its reach 
and popularity if it hopes to win re-election next spring. Many 
Albertans are seeking some financial prudence as opposed to the spending
 free-for-all we've been witness to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worryingly, that's not 
likely to be the case when Thursday's budget is revealed. Finance 
Minister Joe Ceci said Tuesday the document will include anticipated 
revenue from expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, apparently with 
the aim of balancing the budget within five years - well after the next 
election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No sensible homeowner 
would cobble together a budget with the assumption they'd be getting a 
pay increase in a few years. And yet this is what passes for NDP 
mathematics - the hope that having imposed a punitive carbon tax on its 
citizens to win so-called <b>social licence</b> for pipelines, that politicians who are indifferent to <b>energy</b> infrastructure, or openly oppose them, are going to facilitate the flow of billions of dollars into Alberta's coffers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP have proven to be
 poor money managers, but surely we're not to have faith in such wild 
speculation. Opposition Leader Jason Kenney sees the danger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We obviously hope that 
Trans Mountain gets built quickly, but what we've seen is a year of 
delays already and the very strong potential of yet further delays," 
said the United Conservative Party leader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is putting a lot of eggs in one uncertain basket, and that's not how you budget."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government should 
focus instead on reducing costs. Last year's budget projected that by 
2020, Alberta's debt will be $70 billion - which is the equivalent of 
$16,500 for every person in the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists Janice 
MacKinnon and Jack Mintz argue that Alberta can learn lessons from other
 provinces, such as Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia, which spent an
 average of $9,233 per capita last year on services. Alberta spent 
$12,409 per person - that's $3,176 more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In health care alone, 
they note, Alberta spends $915 more per capita than the average of the 
other three large provinces, which means spending $3.8 billion more 
annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP shouldn't put 
revenue from incompleted pipelines in its ledgers. It should engage in 
the thoughtful work Albertans elected them to do and focus on reducing 
expenses.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ERCE report</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ERCE report assesses 
the contingent resources in the Bahar Fasila waterflood project and the 
prospective resources in the Gum Deniz Miocene prospect. The ERCE report
 is dated and effective as of March 2, 2018. The independent assessment 
was carried out in accordance with the standards and the resources 
definitions contained in the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook as
 established by the Canadian Securities Administrators in National 
Instrument 51-101 -- Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities,
 and consistent with the classification and reporting requirements of

in the ERCE report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Waterflood development</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bahar <b>Energy</b> Ltd. 
plans to initiate a waterflood of the FS reservoir in Bahar in 2019, 
starting with the implementation of five waterflood pilots. Assuming a 
positive reservoir response to the pilot flood, a full-scale 
water-injection project would be implemented by Bahar <b>Energy</b>. 
Initially, the drilling of two down-dip injection wells located in the 
water leg of the FS reservoir would be carried out. The drilling of a 
total of nine injection wells is planned over a five-year period from 
three existing platforms and one new platform to be constructed on the 
western flank of the reservoir.</p>

(1) Contingent resources are estimates of volumes that are potentially recoverable from known accumulations 
using established technology or technology under development, but which are not currently considered to be 
commercially recoverable due to one or more contingencies.
(2) The volumes reported are risked in the sense that they have been adjusted for chance of development. 
The chance of development is defined as the probability of a project being commercially viable. Quantifying 
the chance of development requires consideration of both economic contingencies and other contingencies, 
such as legal, regulatory, market access, political, <b>social licence</b>, internal and external approvals, and 
commitment to project finance and development timing. As many of these factors are extremely difficult to 
quantify, the chance of development is uncertain and must be used with caution. ERCE determined that a 
70-per-cent chance of development is appropriate for the contingent resources.
(3) Gross contingent resources are all volumes estimated to be recoverable from the field without any 
economic cut-off being applied. Gross weight interest contingent resources is adjusted for the company's 
80-per-cent working interest fraction of the gross contingent resources. net contingent resources are 
adjusted for the company's working interest share after deduction of royalty obligations.
(4) Project maturity for contingent resources has been classified as development unclarified.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exploration drilling</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has mapped a 
significant structural closure at Miocene level at a depth of between 
4,000 metres and 4,500 metres (subsea) based on 3-D seismic. The 
prospective horizon is located beneath the oil-producing reservoirs of 
the Gum Deniz oil field and this horizon has not yet been penetrated by a
 well in the Bahar purchase and sale agreement. The company is also 
monitoring the drilling of the Absheron Operating Co. (AOC) Miocene well
 test, which is located approximately four kilometres northeast of the 
Bahar project. The well is being drilled from the same surface location 
as the 2015 Hovsan 1870 gas discovery well, which reportedly encountered
 high-pressure gas of 16 million standard cubic feet per day and 
condensate of 640 barrels per day in the top of the Miocene at 
approximately 4,600 metres (subsea). The well reportedly also 
encountered high bottom-hole pressures in excess of 11,000 pounds per 
square inch.</p>

(2) Gross unrisked prospective resources are all volumes estimated to be recoverable from an accumulation. 
There is no equivalent COGEH definition.
(3) Net unrisked prospective resources are the company's working interest fraction of the gross unrisked 
prospective resources. The equivalent COGEH definition is gross working interest prospective resources, 
which is the company's working interest fraction in prospective resources prior to the deduction of 
royalties.
(4) Net risked prospective resources are the company's working interest fraction of the net unrisked 
prospective resources multiplied by the geological chance of success.  The COS is an estimate of the 
probability that drilling the prospect would result in a discovery as defined under PRMS. ERCE has 
assigned a chance of success of 32 per cent to the prospective resources. Under COGEH, prospective 
resources are risked by a chance of commerciality, being the product of the chance of development and 
the chance of discovery. For further detail, see notes (2) to (4) of the table entitled, "Prospective 
Resources, Gum Deniz Miocene Prospect."
(5) Prospective resources are both unrisked in that they have not been multiplied by the COS and risked 
in that the volumes have been multiplied by the COS.

John Harkins, president and chief executive officer of Greenfields, 
stated: "We are pleased that this independent analysis affirms the 
company's internal interpretation of a major waterflood development 
opportunity in the Fasila horizon in the Bahar field and a significant 
Miocene exploration objective beneath the Gum Deniz oil field that can 
be drilled from Gum Island with a suitable land-based rig, with combined
 original oil-in-place estimates in excess of a hundred million barrels 
of oil equivalent if a discovery is made."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Guidance</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The associated table and 
discussion provide a comparison of Greenfields' operational guidance and
 actual results of production for the year ended Dec. 31, 2017. The 
original guidance was disclosed by the company in a press release dated 
April 24, 2017, which may be viewed on SEDAR. Actual results presented

</pre>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reason for variance</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The primary factors 
contributing to lower than expected production were: (i) the slower pace
 of executing scheduled workovers, reflecting, in part, limited access 
to heavy-lift vessels; (ii) the lower than expected postworkover 
production rates; and (iii) the slow pace of south Gum Deniz electric 
submersible pump (ESP) installations as workovers in old wellbores 
required additional cleaning and scraping runs. The corporation plans to
 address the limited access to heavy-lift vessels through the 
acquisition of a heavier rig that is better suited to deal with the 
challenges imposed by the old wells and difficult workovers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, Bahar <b>Energy</b>
 Operating Co. Ltd. elected to defer both capital and operating 
expenditures until the development plan and reservoir studies were 
completed, which would further facilitate the delineation and selection 
of the best projects going forward. The reservoir studies were initially
 expected to be completed by April 2017, in respect of the gas field, 
and by midyear 2017, in respect of the oil field. However, the studies 
were not completed until the first quarter of 2018 as a result of the 
identification of development opportunities (particularly waterfloods), 
additional evaluation work requested by the reserve auditors (<span class="companylink">GLJ Petroleum Consultants</span>
 and ERCE), and data inconsistencies resulting from scribed logs and 
well files that required clarification and further delineation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In light of 
lower-than-expected production, the company revised its 2017 budget, 
resulting in downward adjustments to capital expenditures to 
$9.7-million (from guidance of $21-million (U.S.)) and operating 
expenses to $23-million (from guidance of $28-million (U.S.)). The 
deferral of projected expenditures intended to increase gross lease 
production from 4,167 barrels of oil equivalent per day at Dec. 31, 
2016, resulted in the realization of approximately 24 per cent less 
revenue than originally expected by the company.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uber pulled its test 
fleet of self-driving cars off public roads in Toronto and other cities 
after one of the vehicles hit and killed a woman in Arizona in the first
 pedestrian fatality attributed to this emerging technology. Police in 
Tempe, a suburb of Phoenix, said the 49-year-old woman was hit Sunday 
night by a vehicle that had a human attendant aboard but was operating 
in autonomous mode. Uber issued a statement saying “our hearts go out to
 the victim’s family.” In the transportation industry, such a death was 
widely considered inevitable as the number of self-driving vehicles 
multiplied, but it still sparked shock waves. “One of the problems … is 
that there are too many people who are overhyping the technology,” said 
Barrie Kirk, executive director of the Canadian Automated Vehicles 
Centre of Excellence near Ottawa. “All hardware, all software, fails 
occasionally.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Canada is timidly back. The Liberal government announced the return to <span class="companylink">UN peacekeeping</span>

Chrystia Freeland let slip that caution is the watchword for the mission

That was an apt description for what Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan 
announced: Two transport helicopters and four attack helicopters will be
 sent to Mali, with crews, support troops and medical staff. It’s not 
boots on the ground, in the sense that Canadian troops won’t patrol 
dangerous areas of Mali, a country where Islamist terrorists harass

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rita Joe dies</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">March 20, 2007- They 
called her Gentle Warrior. But the woman known as the poet laureate of 
the Mi’kmaq people had battle scars, earned from childhood. Rita Bernard
 was born in Whycocomagh, Cape Breton, on March 15, 1932. Her mother 
died when she was 5; her father when she was 10. She lived in numerous 
foster homes and suffered abuse. At 12, she arrived at Shubenacadie 
Indian Residential School. She thought it looked like a castle; later, 
she compared it to prison. After four years there, she had to relearn 
Mi’kmaq, her native language, as she later recounted in her poem, I Lost
 My Talk. She eventually married Frank Joe and they raised eight 
children, including two foster children. “Only a housewife with a 
dream,” as she described herself, she began writing in her 30s. But she 
went on to publish seven books, including an autobiography, Song of Rita
 Joe, and was awarded the Order of Canada. I Lost My Talk eventually 
became the basis for a <span class="companylink">National Arts Centre</span>
 show and was quoted in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission report. 
“Let me find my talk, so I can teach you about me,” it ends. Rita Joe 
died March 20, 2007, an unfinished poem in her typewriter. Marsha

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Politicians may like carbon taxes. But most people don't</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not so long ago, Justin Trudeau's <b>energy</b>
 strategy looked so simple. It rested on a Grand Bargain. Canada would 
build a pipeline or two, and the citizens would do penance in the form 
of carbon taxes that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Everybody – 
environmentalists, the oil industry and right-thinking Canadians – would
 be happy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, that bargain is 
looking mighty shaky. Opponents of Trans Mountain aren't interested in 
it. Alberta's Premier, Rachel Notley, will probably lose her job next 
year because she has delivered carbon taxes but no pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her nemesis, Jason 
Kenney, is planning to abolish the carbon tax as soon as he beats her 
(as is likely). He points out that it has utterly failed to secure a <b>social licence</b>
 for pipelines. “Very expensive political theatre for Albertans," he 
calls it. And now, the anti-carbon-tax crusader Doug Ford could well 
become premier of Ontario. It's hard to see how Mr. Trudeau will impose 
his grand bargain on the provinces if Alberta and Ontario are in open 
revolt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what about the rest of us?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liberals, 
environmentalists and economists tell us carbon taxes are a virtually 
painless way to get us to act virtuously, by cutting down on fossil 
fuels. They are a good tax. Unfortunately, too many of us don't like 
them anyway. As Mr. Ford likes to say whenever he has a chance, “A tax 
is a tax is a tax."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carbon taxes are 
allegedly revenue-neutral because the money is returned to taxpayers in 
the form of rebates or offset by lower taxes elsewhere. But the reality 
is different. In fact, governments can't keep their greedy mitts off the
 money. Even the model province of British Columbia is now diverting 
part of its provincial carbon tax to fund tax credits for preferred 
groups, such as filmmakers. In Alberta, only about a quarter of the 
amount raised by the carbon tax is rebated to taxpayers. Sadly, there is
 a vast difference between the pure world of economic models and the 
grubby world of politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another problem with 
carbon taxes is that you can't possibly make them high enough to be 
effective. If you did you'd be voted out of office. Mr. Trudeau's 
national carbon pricing scheme would start at $10 a tonne, going up to 
$50 by 2022 – enough to be a nuisance, but not nearly enough to affect 
consumer behaviour in any meaningful way. Achieving real behavioural 
change, environmental economists say, would cost many times more. 
According to Simon Fraser University economist Mark Jaccard, carbon 
taxes can only have real impact if governments also introduce a bunch of
 costly and heavy-handed regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, carbon 
taxes can't save the planet. Despite what politicians tell you, they 
basically amount to useless virtuesignalling. But Mr. Trudeau, Ms. 
Notley and Environment Minister Catherine McKenna aren't going to tell 
you this because they want you to believe they have a plan and that the 
plan will work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the date for Mr. 
Trudeau's carbon tax gets closer, taxpayers might start asking an even 
more basic question: What difference will this make in the big scheme of
 things? As India and China and the whole developing world increase <b>energy</b> use, and the United States extracts more fossil fuel than ever in its history, why are we getting this darn tax?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no good answer 
for that. The gap between reality and our intentions is unfathomably 
vast. To avoid the most serious effects of global warming, we should be 
adding about 1,100 megawatts of clean-<b>energy</b> capacity a day – 
equivalent to one nuclear power plant – according to the the MIT 
Technology Review. What we're actually adding: 151 megawatts a day. The 
technologies that are needed to cut emissions deeply simply haven't been
 developed yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“[V]irtually all sober 
analyses conclude that the target [of two degrees of warming] is now 
unobtainable," climate expert Ted Nordhaus wrote in Foreign Affairs. But
 don't blame venal politicians or evil industry. The root of the problem
 is much more basic, he argues: “Decarbonization is hard." He calls the 
insistence that we can meet the 2 C threshold a dangerous delusion that 
distracts us from what we can do to address the changes that are coming 
no matter what.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of this is a 
rationale for doing nothing. We should be doing a lot, on many fronts, 
to develop the breakthrough technologies that will really make a 
difference. Forking over billions for government to use however they 
like does not strike me as part of the solution.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there's one thing I 
hope all Albertans can agree on, it's the desperate need for more 
pipelines to get our abundant oil and gas resources to market. According
 to recent reports, Alberta is losing $7 billion per year because of 
lack of pipeline capacity, with industry losing $6.7 billion more 
annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While we disagree with 
how the NDP has handled the strategy surrounding the Trans Mountain 
expansion, we don't doubt the need for the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't that long ago 
when pipelines were built in this country with little controversy. Under
 the previous Harper government, four major pipeline projects were 
completed. Keystone, Alberta Clipper, the Line 9 reversal and Anchor 
Loop were all successfully completed under the previous government, 
adding 1.73 million barrels per day of capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, it is true that none
 of these projects were to tidewater, as the NDP is happy to point out. 
But Trans Mountain was not up for government approval under the previous
 Conservative government. The NDP's cousins in Ottawa would no doubt 
have howled if the Harper government dared to short circuit the 
regulatory process by approving a pipeline before a thorough review was 
completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northern Gateway, the one
 tidewater pipeline up for decision under the Harper Conservatives, was 
indeed approved. Sadly, the project was retroactively cancelled by the 
Trudeau Liberals as part of their plan to ban tanker traffic off B.C.'s 
northern coast (never mind that Alaskan tankers have travelled down that
 route for decades). And the Trudeau Liberals later rigged the approval 
process midstream to scuttle <b>Energy</b> East, another pipeline to tidewater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, radical 
activists have engaged in a concerted effort to specifically target and 
sideline Canada's oil and gas industry. Millions of dollars of foreign 
funding have flooded into the Canadian environmental movement with the 
clear goal of starving our resources of markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta NDP government promised that imposing a carbon tax on Albertans would buy so-called <b>social licence</b>
 in B.C. for a pipeline to the Pacific. We are baffled the Alberta 
government bought this argument, since it's their fellow travellers - 
both the B.C. NDP and radical environmental activists such as Tzeporah 
Berman - who are leading the fight against the approved Trans Mountain 
expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surely, the Alberta NDP 
understood that their friends would not be willing to trade a carbon tax
 for a pipeline. In fact, Premier Rachel Notley finally acknowledged 
this reality in a recent interview with <span class="companylink">CBC Radio</span>.
 When asked why not put a hold on the carbon tax until the pipeline 
begins construction, she responded, "quite honestly, I don't know that 
B.C. would care one way or another if we did that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The truth is that the 
Trudeau Liberals provided paper regulatory approval for the pipeline, 
purportedly because of Alberta's willingness to impose a carbon tax on 
its citizens. Yet today, the Trudeau Liberals are willing to do little 
beyond rhetoric to fight for Trans Mountain in the face of vociferous 
opposition in B.C., hurting the 51 First Nations that have signed off in
 support of the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's in all 
Albertans'interest to see this pipeline succeed. We in the United 
Conservative Party welcome the government's recent about face. After 
months mocking our suggestions to threaten the B.C. NDP with serious 
consequences, including potentially cutting off oil shipments and 
tolling B.C. natural gas, the premier has finally accepted our advice, 
albeit far too late.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We welcome a robust, 
serious debate on what's needed to get this pipeline built. But we 
should not be deluded into the fantasy that punitive taxes on everyday 
Albertans will appease the fringe yet extremely vocal anti-pipeline 
minority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, we must make it clear to the vast majority of reasonable Canadians that the success of our <b>energy</b>
 sector is critical for the success of our country, and that Alberta 
cannot be taken for granted any longer. Prasad Panda is the United 
Conservative MLA for Calgary-Foothills.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Poor Rachel Notley. She's spent so much of her political career telling people about the importance of <b>social licence</b> only to find out, in her hour of need, that the federal government won't get her one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one would ever confuse the premier of Alberta for a stalwart friend of the province's <b>energy</b>
 sector. But since this former oilsands critic became premier she has, 
at least, acknowledged a more realistic view of fossil fuels and their 
importance to a modern economy, and the need to get her province's oil 
to tidewater for export. But she also told Albertans they would need to 
make sacrifices to win over opponents, demonstrating the province's 
environmental bona fides, never mind the fact that Alberta's oil was 
already the most environmentally friendly petroleum in the world. She 
imposed a carbon tax. She put caps on the oilsands. Albertans paid 
dearly for her plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alas, all those efforts 
have bought little support from B.C, where Notley's fellow NDP premier, 
propped up by a handful of Green MLAs, isn't about to let Alberta make 
any progress on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. The federal 
government, too, despite the occasional supportive grunt, certainly 
doesn't seem inclined to do much more than offer repeated, vague 
restatements about approved projects needing to move ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley has understandably
 had enough. Now she says Alberta won't increase its carbon tax to $50 
per tonne, in line with federal commitments to a national target, as 
originally intended, until Ottawa treats Alberta with the same respect. 
"Our government was very clear well over a year ago that we will sign on
 to the federal government's pan-Canadian framework with the approval of
 the Trans Mountain pipeline," she said in the legislature this week. 
"Now, obviously, approval means nothing if it's not constructed ... we 
will not move forward ... until we see that construction is fully 
underway and that approval is given meaning."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not hard to see the

who's been an ally for the PM on the climate file so far, will be 
unfortunate for the federal Liberals and their dreams of a national 
carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one should hold their breath waiting for Trudeau to actually do much. The PM knows the drill: talk a lot about <b>social licence</b>,
 and then wait interminably for a licence that will never be given to 
never arrive. It's the progressive way. It's a wonder that Notley didn't

popular resistance to construction of the <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> pipeline."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not the only U.S.
 organization devoted to blocking development of Canada's oil and gas 
reserves that, incidentally, would compete with America's own resources.
 Vivian Krause, a Vancouver-based researcher and writer, has documented 
the money funnelled through Tides Foundation, New Venture Fund and the 
Oak Foundation to impede Canadian hydrocarbon growth, especially the oil
 sands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These organizations are 
bolstered by a coterie of narcissistic celebrities whose vacuous 
certainty is outdone by their ignorance of science and economics and 
their extravagant carbon-intensive lifestyles.? All this brings to mind 
when, as minister of natural resources, I wrote an open letter labelling
 certain environmental groups as "radicals," financed in part by 
non-Canadian donors. The derisive outcry was deafening from media, 
opposition parties, ENGOs and even a few timorous senior executives in 
the oil and gas business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I defined radical as 
opposition to every major resource project. Moreover, I issued a 
challenge to any environmental organization to name a single pipeline 
project that it supported. The silence was deafening. Possibly because 
my definition sounded too reasonable, the media never reported on my 
explanation of the definition or the challenge, which I reiterated 
numerous times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What I said was factual 
then and has been conclusively proven to be true over the past six 
years. Trying to shut down fossil-fuel development is not viewed as 
radical to many environmentalists, even though the economic consequences
 would be disastrous. Or perhaps it was impolite in Canada to use the 
"r" word. It was obviously politically incorrect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Irrespective of 
terminology, we have undoubtedly reached a crisis resulting from 
unrelenting opposition to pipeline construction, abetted by foreign 
funding and a federal government obsessed with green ideology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is telling that 
opponents are unimpressed by governments' efforts to reduce greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions. They understand that Canada cannot make a 
meaningful difference to international emissions, since our output 
represents only 1.6 per cent of the global total. Their focus is on the 
oil sands, which they claim can measurably add to the global supply of 
oil, so keeping fossil fuels in the ground is their goal. The fact the 
oil sands only represent a minuscule one-thousandth of global emissions 
makes it the wrong target. But symbolism is everything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Militants are indifferent
 to the terrible damage they are inflicting on our economy, First 
Nations and the poor, all without any measurable impact on global 
warming. Further, they assert that Canada has a moral responsibility to 
make costly but ineffective sacrifices, even though other countries are 
not doing their share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The B.C. government's 
campaign against the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion proves there is 
no point in succumbing to extortionate demands or making costly 
concessions to achieve an elusive <b>social licence</b>. The goal posts 
keep moving. By now, that must be evident even to Alberta Premier Rachel
 Notley and federal Natural Resource Minister Jim Carr, though they will
 never admit it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At what point might <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>
 headquarters in Houston cancel the project in frustration with its 
mounting financial and reputational risk? That would landlock Canada's <b>energy</b>
 for a very long time, a disastrous result, which is the goal of 
opponents. It is time for Parliament to declare the pipeline a work "for
 the general advantage of Canada," thereby removing most dilatory 
tactics (but not social resistance). Prime Minister Justin Trudeau 
should also tell foreign agitators to butt out of Canadian affairs.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EDMONTON — Alberta 
Premier Rachel Notley and Opposition Leader Jason Kenney exchanged 
smiles and brief waves in the Alberta legislature Monday before letting 
the accusations fly in their first question period together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney accused Notley of 
misleading Albertans on her carbon tax while the premier said Kenney and
 other Conservatives let down all of Canada by failing to get a pipeline
 built to tidewater while in power in Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had Conservatives in 
Ottawa, we had Conservatives in Edmonton (in the provincial government) 
and we had Conservatives in Victoria and they couldn't get a pipeline 
built," Notley told the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They had their chance and they blew it. That won't happen again."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney attacked Notley 
over the multibillion-dollar carbon tax. He noted Notley didn't campaign
 on it in the 2015 election. And he questioned its value as a good faith
 "<b>social licence</b>" gesture given that the Trans Mountain pipeline 
expansion to B.C., approved by Ottawa, is still facing delays from the 
B.C. government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"(Notley) told Albertans 
if we just pay more for everything somehow magically pipeline opponents 
would become pipeline supporters and pipelines would get built," said 
Kenney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As per the noisy, raucous
 parliamentary tradition, Notley's answers were met with cheers and desk
 thumping from her caucus members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney's questions and comments, however, were met with silence from his team and there was no cross-aisle heckling of Notley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney later told reporters that's how he wants it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think people who tune 
in actually want to be able to hear their legislators and what they are 
saying. Just endless, pointless background noise inhibits that," he 
said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My observation as a 
regular Albertan watching this assembly (before) was I couldn't hear 
half of what they were saying with all the thumping going on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney and the UCP caucus
 members focused on the carbon tax during question period. Kenney said 
it will be the theme during the spring sitting and up to the next 
election in the spring of 2019, and has promised to scrap the tax if he 
becomes premier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley said the tax 
helped build the moral foundation for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's 
decision to green light the Trans Mountain expansion in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley has been locked in
 a battle with B.C. Premier John Horgan's government over what Alberta 
terms delay tactics on the pipeline, including court challenges in an 
area that Notley says is clearly an area of federal responsibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Notley 
announced Alberta will consider curtailing the flow of oil if B.C. 
continues its tactics, an idea that Kenney had been touting for weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After question period, 
all sides debated a government motion to urge Ottawa take action to get 
Trans Mountain approved and to support the province in its effort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At every step along the way, our government has made the case to Canadians (for <b>energy</b> development and pipelines)," Notley told the house after introducing the motion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney has promised to elevate the decorum from his caucus the house, hence the impromptu cross-aisle wave to the premier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I intended to actually 
go over and shake her hand but then all of my guys started shouting at 
me," said Kenney. "Apparently you can't cross the floor, metaphorically 
speaking, here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I just wanted to salute 
her. At the end of the day we're going to disagree on a lot of things, 
agree on some, but we don't have to be nasty about it."</p>

Mr. Michael Binnion reports</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTERRE REPORTS YEAR-END RESERVES AND RESOURCES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questerre <b>Energy</b> Corp</span>. has 
released the results of its Dec. 31, 2017, reserves assessment and 
evaluation of its oil and natural gas properties, as evaluated by <span class="companylink">McDaniel &amp; Associates Consultants Ltd</span>.
 with an effective date of Dec. 31, 2017, prepared in accordance with 
the standards contained in the Canadian oil and gas evaluation handbook 
and National Instrument 51-101 -- Standards of Disclosure for Oil and 
Gas Activities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, president and chief executive officer, commented: "Our 
reserve growth reflects the active drilling program at Kakwa this year 
and the light oil acquisition at Antler. Corporate proved and probable 
reserves gross reserves grew by 20 per cent or 3.22 million barrels of 
oil equivalent from 15.7 mmboe to 18.41 mmboe, net of production during 
the year. The before-tax NPV10 [net present value at a 10-per-cent 
discount] estimated for the corporate proved and probable reserves using
 McDaniel's year-end price forecast is $174.7-million."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commenting on Questerre's
 Utica resources in Quebec, he added: "The reserve engineers updated our
 resource report from last year for their current price forecast. The 
best estimate of risked contingent resources net to Questerre for the 
Becancour and Lotbiniere project areas is unchanged at 214 billion cubic
 feet. These project areas as assessed only cover 5 per cent of our 
total acreage. The risked net present value discounted at 10 per cent 
before tax for this limited development area is $301-million compared to
 $311-million last year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credit facility</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company also reported
 on the status of its credit facility review that was conducted in the 
fourth quarter of 2017. The lender has advised that the primary credit 
facility will be renewed at $18-million. The facility will include a 
$17.9-million revolving operating demand facility. Credit facility A can
 be used for general corporate purposes, continuing operations and 
capital expenditures within Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dec. 31, 2017, reserve information</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In accordance with the 
requirements of NI 51-101, the company anticipates filing its annual 
information form that includes more detailed disclosure relating to 
petroleum and natural gas activities for the 2017 fiscal year, in the 
form of Form 51-101F1, at the end of March, 2018, as set out in the 
report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The associated tables set
 forth contain certain information relating to the oil and natural gas 
reserves of the company's properties and the present value of the 
estimated future net cash flow associated with such reserves as at Dec. 
31, 2017, which numbers may vary slightly from those presented in the

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dec. 31, 2017, Quebec resource information</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questerre also reported on the year-end update prepared by <span class="companylink">GLJ Petroleum Consultants Ltd</span>.
 to the independent resource assessment of its 735,910 gross (190,800 
net) acres in the St. Lawrence lowlands, Quebec, that have potential for
 the Upper Utica shale effective Dec. 31, 2017, in a report dated March 
5, 2018. The GLJ resource assessment was prepared in accordance with NI 
51-101 and the standards contained in the COGE handbook. The GLJ 
resource assessment did not include any of the corporation's other 
properties. All anticipated results disclosed herein were prepared by 
GLJ, which is an independent qualified reserves evaluator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GLJ used probabilistic 
methods to generate low, best and high estimates of total petroleum 
initially in place (TPIIP), both discovered and undiscovered. 
Recoverable contingent and prospective resources over Questerre's 
acreage were estimated by analogy and based on available well data over 
the Quebec Utica and public data from U.S. Utica and Marcellus shale 
plays. The evaluation consisted of the Upper Utica which includes the 
Indian Castle and Dolgeville members as well as the Flat Creek. The Flat
 Creek, the lowermost member, was only evaluated to estimate 
undiscovered petroleum initially in place (UPIIP). No recoverable 
resources were assigned to the Flat Creek given the lack of test data 
showing established technology can support commercial development at 
this time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GLJ resource 
assessment is based on the results from several vertical and horizontal 
wells on the Questerre's acreage that have all encountered pay in the 
Utica. Test data from these wells in conjunction with offset development
 and studies of the analogous U.S. Utica support the prospective 
commercial development of these resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Significant positive 
factors relevant to the estimate of Questerre's resources include the 
importation of all natural gas consumed in Quebec creating demand for 
local production, premium realized pricing due to the transportation 
costs associated with importing natural gas for consumption, production 
test data from Questerre's existing wells and the development of the 
analogous Utica shale in the United States. Significant negative factors
 include the limited number of wells on Questerre's acreage, lack of a 
developed service sector providing uncertainty regarding estimates of 
capital and operating costs, developing hydrocarbon regulations and 
environmental legislation and the requirement to obtain social 
acceptability for oil and gas operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Questerre believes 
it will have sufficient financial capability to finance its share of 
costs associated with the development program in the GLJ resource 
assessment, it may not have access to the necessary capital when 
required. Conducting the development program is also dependent on the 
participation by Questerre's joint venture partners. There is no 
guarantee that they will elect to participate in the program to the 
extent required. Questerre retains the right to conduct activities 
without the operators' participation on an independent operations basis 
whereby it can finance 100 per cent of the capital costs for certain 
well operations and facilities in return for net revenue equal to 400 
per cent of its capital investment before the operators can elect to 
either remain in a penalty position or hold a working interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent resources</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The TPIIP was determined 
probabilistically on a permit basis with estimates of 45 billion to 145 
billion cubic feet per square mile for the Upper Utica. This compares 
favourably with analogous U.S. shale plays with estimates of the Utica 
in Ohio at between 35 billion and 85 billion cubic feet per square mile 
and 25 billion to 150 billion cubic feet per square mile for the 
Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania. Of the TPIIP estimated over Questerre's
 acreage, only land within a three-mile radius of a successfully tested 
well was quantified as discovered gas in place. Based on this 
qualification only 16 per cent of the total mapped TPIIP in the Upper 
Utica was considered discovered contingent resource.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Upper Utica was 
considered undiscovered for approximately 84 per cent of the total 
mapped TPIIP. Recovery factors of 18 per cent, 26 per cent and 37 per 
cent were applied to the low, best and high estimates resource cases, 
respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Summary information 
regarding contingent resources and net present value of future net 
revenues from contingent resources is set forth below and is derived, in
 each case, from the GLJ resource assessment. All contingent resources 
evaluated in the GLJ resource assessment were deemed economic at the 
effective date of Dec. 31, 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questerre's average 
working interest in its gross best estimate contingent resources is 25.9
 per cent. In addition to Questerre's working interest, the company also
 holds a royalty interest in the acreage and associated resources. As a 
result, in some cases Questerre's net volumes (after royalties) exceed 
its working interest volumes. For clarity, included in the associated 
tables are Questerre's volume before royalties, gross working interest 
volumes and net volumes after royalties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A range of contingent resources estimates (low, best and high) was prepared by GLJ.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GLJ resources 
assessment estimated gross risked contingent resources with a project 
maturity subclass of development on hold of 18.6 million boe (low 
estimate) to 50 million boe (high estimate), with a best estimate of 
30.4 million boe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GLJ resources 
assessment estimated gross risked contingent resources with a project 
maturity subclass of development unclarified of 8.9 million boe (low 
estimate) to 23.8 million boe (high estimate), with a best estimate of 
14.6 million boe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estimate of risked net
 present value of future net revenue of contingent resources is 
preliminary in nature and is provided to assist the reader in reaching 
an opinion on the merit and likelihood of the company proceeding with 
the required investment. It includes contingent resources that are 
considered too uncertain with respect to the chance of development to be
 classified as reserves. There is uncertainty that the risked net 
present value of future net revenue will be realized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent resources can 
be subclassified based on their project maturity subclass which help 
identify a project's change of commerciality. The project maturity 
subclasses for contingent resources are development pending, development
 on hold, development unclarified or development not viable, all as 
defined in the COGE handbook. Development pending is when resolution of 
the final conditions for development is being actively pursued (high 
chance of development). Development on hold is when there is a 
reasonable chance of development, but there are major non-technical 
contingencies to be resolved that are usually beyond the control of the 
operator. Development unclarified is when the evaluation is incomplete 
and there is continuing activity to resolve any risks or uncertainties. 
Development not viable is when no further data acquisition or evaluation
 is currently planned and hence there is a low chance of development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those areas classified as
 development on hold are primarily contingent on the passage of 
applicable hydrocarbon and environmental legislation and regulations as 
well as local acceptability. Remaining areas classified as development 
unclarified have additional contingency or risk associated with securing
 <b>social licence</b> to operate and are thereby a lower priority for 
development. Additional contingencies include firm development plans, 
detailed cost estimates and corporate approvals and sanctioning. There 
is no certainty that any portion of the contingent resources will be 
economic to develop. Though pilot horizontal development plans have been
 proposed, the project evaluation scenario for the contingent resources 
is not sufficiently defined to make an investment decision to proceed to
 development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent resources are 
evaluated based on the same fiscal conditions used in the assessment of 
reserves, and as such, are forecasted to be economic. Contingent 
resource values are estimated on the basis of established technology, 
namely multistage hydraulic fracturing recovery technologies that are 
widely used in the development of shale gas plays including in the 
Montney in Canada and the Utica formation in Ohio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chance of 
commerciality for contingent resources is equal to the product of the 
chance of discovery and the chance of development. Chance of discovery 
is the estimated probability that exploration activities will confirm 
the existence of a significant accumulation of potentially recoverable 
petroleum. Chance of development is the estimated probability that, once
 discovered, a known accumulation will be commercially developed. Based 
on contingencies related to the passage of applicable hydrocarbon and 
environmental legislation, regulations, local acceptability, and 
additional risk associated with securing <b>social licence</b> to 
operate, firm development plans, detailed cost estimates and corporate 
approvals GLJ estimated the chance of development for the development 
unclarified subclass ranges between 10 per cent and 25 per cent as 
detailed in the associated table. By definition the chance of discovery 
for contingent resource is 100 per cent. The corresponding chance of 
commerciality for the development unclarified subclass is therefore 
estimated at between 10 per cent and 25 per cent as detailed in the 
associated table.</p>

Notes:
(1) Contingent resources are defined in the COGE handbook as those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given 
date, to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established technology or technology under 
development, but which are not currently considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more contingencies.
There is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the contingent resources or that
Questerre will produce any portion of the volumes currently classified as contingent resources. The estimates of 
contingent resources involve implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the resources 
described exists in the quantities predicted or estimated, as at a given date, and that the resources can be 
profitably produced in the future. The risked net present value of the future net revenue from the contingent 
resources does not represent the fair market value of the contingent resources. Actual contingent resources (and 
any volumes that may be reclassified as reserves) and future production therefrom may be greater than or less 
than the estimates provided herein.
(2) GLJ prepared the estimates of contingent resources shown for each property using deterministic principles and 
methods. Probabilistic aggregation of the low and high property estimates shown in the table might produce 
different total volumes than the arithmetic sums shown in the table.
(3) Gross contingent resources are Questerre's working interest (operating or non-operating) share before 
deduction of royalties and without including any royalty interests of Questerre. Net contingent resources are 
Questerre's working interest (operating or non-operating) share after deduction of royalty obligations, plus 
Questerre's royalty interests in contingent resources.
(4) The risked net present value of future net revenue attributable to the contingent resources does not represent 
the fair market value of the contingent resources. Estimated abandonment and reclamation costs have been included 
in the evaluation.
(5) Low estimate contingent resources are considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the low estimate. 
If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 90-per-cent probability (P90) that the quantities 
actually recovered will equal or exceed the low estimate.
(6) Best estimate contingent resources are considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will actually 
be recovered. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than 
the best estimate. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50-per-cent probability (P50) 
that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the best estimate.
(7) High estimate contingent resources are considered to be an optimistic estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the high 
estimate. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 10-per-cent probability (P10) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the high estimate.
(8) The chance of development (CoDev) is the estimated probability that, once discovered, a known accumulation 
will be commercially developed. Five factors have been considered in determining the CoDev as follows:
CoDev equals Ps (economic factor) times Ps (technology factor) times Ps (development plan factor)  times Ps 
(development time frame factor) times Ps (other contingency factor) wherein Ps is the probability of success.
Economic factor -- For reserves to be assessed, a project must be economic. With respect to contingent 
resources, this factor captures uncertainty in the assessment of economic status principally due to uncertainty 
in cost estimates and marketing options. Economic viability uncertainty due to technology is more aptly captured 
with the technology factor. The economic factor will be one for reserves and will often be one for development 
pending projects and for projects with a development study or predevelopment study with a robust rate of 
return. A robust rate of return means that the project retains economic status with variation in costs and/or 
marketing plans over the expected range of outcomes for these variables.
Technology factor -- For reserves to be assessed, a project must utilize established technology. With respect to 
contingent resources, this factor captures the uncertainty in the viability of the proposed technology for 
the subject reservoir, namely, the uncertainty associated with technology under development. By definition, 
technology under development is a recovery process or process improvement that has been determined to be 
technically viable via field test and is being field tested further to determine its economic viability in the 
subject reservoir. The technology factor will be one for reserves and for established technology. For technology 
under development, this factor will consider different risks associated with technologies being developed at 
the scale of the well versus the scale of a project and technologies which are being modified or extended for 
the subject reservoir versus new emerging technologies which have not previously been applied in any 
commercial application. The risk assessment will also consider the quality and sufficiency of the test data 
available, the ability to reliably scale such data and the ability to extrapolate results in time.
Development plan factor -- For reserves to be assessed, a project must have a detailed development plan. 
With respect to contingent resources, this factor captures the uncertainty in the project evaluation 
scenario. The development plan factor will be one for reserves and high, approaching one, for development 
pending projects. This factor will consider development plan detail variations including the degree of 
delineation, reservoir specific development and operating strategy detail (technology decision, well 
layouts (spacing and pad locations), completion strategy, start-up strategy, water source and disposal, other 
infrastructure, facility design, marketing plans) and the quality of the cost estimates as provided by the 
developer.
Development time frame factor -- In the case of major projects, for reserves to be assessed, first major capital 
spending must be initiated within five years of the effective date. The development time frame factor will be 
one for reserves and will often be one for development pending projects provided the project is planned 
on stream based on the same criteria used in the assessment of reserves. With respect to contingent resources, 
the factor will approach one for projects planned on stream with a time frame slightly longer than the 
limiting reserves criteria.
Other contingency factor -- For reserves to be assessed, all contingencies must be eliminated. With respect 
to contingent resources, this factor captures major contingencies, usually beyond the control of the operator, 
other than those captured by economic status, technology status, project evaluation scenario status and the 
development time frame. The other contingency factor will be one for reserves and for development pending 
projects and less than one for on hold. Provided all contingencies have been identified and their resolution 
is reasonably certain, this factor would also be one for development unclarified projects.
These factors may be interrelated (dependent) and care has been taken to ensure that risks are appropriately 
accounted.
(1) Contingent resources for the lowlands have been estimated based the results from several vertical and 
horizontal wells on the company's acreage that have all encountered pay in the Utica. Test data from these wells 
in conjunction with offset development and studies of analogous U.S. Utica support the prospective commercial 
development on these resources. The estimated unrisked cost to bring these contingent resources on commercial 
production is $809.28-million and the expected timeline is between two and 11 years. The specific contingencies 
for these resources are the passage of applicable hydrocarbon and environmental legislation, regulations, local 
acceptability, firm development plans, detailed cost estimates and corporate approvals and sanctioning.
(2) In Canada, GLJ has estimated a company gross aggregate of risked on hold best estimate contingent resources 
of 30.42 million boe for the projects outlined. Utilizing established recovery technology, the risked estimated 
cost to bring these resources on commercial production is an aggregate of $168-million with an expected 
timeline of two to four years.
Becancour/Ste. Sophie-de-Levrard -- Based on contingencies related to the passage of applicable hydrocarbon and

petroleum. Chance of development is the estimated probability that, once
 discovered, a known accumulation will be commercially developed. Based 
on contingencies related to the passage of applicable hydrocarbon and 
environmental legislation, regulations, local acceptability, and 
additional risk associated with securing <b>social licence</b> to 
operate, firm development plans, detailed cost estimates and corporate 
approvals GLJ estimated the chance of development at 19 per cent. 
Proximity to extensional and compressional-related fault systems 
presents risk of structuring resulting in leak off and reduced pressures
 in some prospective regions, additionally, lack of delineation data 
provides reservoir risk associated with uncertainty regarding reservoir 
quality and rock mechanics amicable to hydraulic fracturing. Therefore, 
GLJ has estimated the chance of discovery at 81 per cent. The 
corresponding chance of commerciality is 15 per cent. This also takes 
into account Questerre's working interest and operatorship of its assets
 as Questerre is subject to the priorities of working interest partners 
for such assets. Production and development forecasts were not completed
 by GLJ as part of the prospective resources evaluation.</p>

Notes 
Prospective resources are defined in the COGE handbook as those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, 
to be potentially recoverable from unknown accumulations by application of future development projects. Prospective 
resources have both an associated chance of discovery (CoDis) and a chance of development (CoDev). There is no 
certainty that any portion of the prospective resources will be discovered. If discovered, there is no certainty that 
it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the prospective resources or that Questerre will produce any 
portion of the volumes currently classified as prospective resources. The estimates of prospective resources involve 
implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the resources described exist in the quantities 
predicted or estimated, as at a given date, and that the resources can be profitably produced in the future. The 
risked net present value of the future net revenue from the prospective resources does not represent the fair market 
value of the prospective resources. Actual prospective resources (and any volumes that may be reclassified as 
reserves) and future production therefrom may be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein.
GLJ prepared the estimates of prospective resources shown for each property using deterministic principles and methods. 
Probabilistic aggregation of the low and high property estimates shown in the table might produce different total 
volumes than the arithmetic sums shown in the table.
The forecast price and cost assumptions utilized in the year-end 2017 reserves report were also utilized by GLJ in 
preparing the GLJ resource assessment.
Gross prospective resources are Questerre's working interest (operating or non-operating) share before deduction of 
royalties and without including any royalty interests of the company. Net prospective resources are Questerre's 
working interest (operating or non-operating) share after deduction of royalty obligations, plus Questerre's royalty 
interests in prospective resources.
The risked net present value of future net revenue attributable to the prospective resources does not represent the 
fair market value of the prospective resources. Estimated abandonment and reclamation costs have been included in 
the evaluation.
The low estimate prospective resources are considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity that will actually 
be recovered. It is likely that the actual net remaining quantities recovered will exceed the low estimate of 87 
million boe. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 90-per-cent probability (P90) that the 
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the low estimate.  
The best estimate prospective resources are considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will actually be 
recovered. It is equally likely that the actual net remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the 
best estimate of 143 million. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50-per-cent probability 
(P50) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the best estimate.
The high estimate prospective resources are considered to be an optimistic estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual net remaining quantities recovered will exceed the high 
estimate of 238 million boe. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 10-per-cent probability 
(P10) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the high estimate.
The chance of commerciality is defined as the product of the chance of discovery and the chance of development. 
Chance of discovery is defined in COGE handbook as the estimated probability that exploration activities will 
confirm the existence of a significant accumulation of potentially recoverable petroleum. Chance of development is 
defined as the estimated probability that, once discovered, a known accumulation will be commercially developed.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Blackbird <b>Energy</b> Inc</span>. will need 
to drill fewer wells than initially contemplated north of the Wapiti 
River in northwestern Alberta to meet its gas processing commitments for
 its liquids-rich lands at Pipestone, the company’s chief executive said
 Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has just 
completed flaring its first well north of the river and plans to drill 
another five wells, down from the eight to 10 it had been considering, 
Garth Braun, president, CEO and chair of the board, told the company’s 
annual meeting. “This reduction is substantial,” he said. “It’s a 
capital reduction that really reduces the burden on Blackbird.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reduced number of 
wells is based on the company’s analysis of adjourning wells in addition
 to its 3-27-71-7W6 well for which it will be announcing the results 
“imminently,” he said. “We are very optimistic.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 3-27 Upper Montney delineation well is approximately 14 kilometres north of Blackbird’s previous development drilling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That well and 
surrounding wells have given us the ability to look at the productivity 
of the resource in that area and to begin to model how many more wells 
we need to implement to meet our first commitment into Tidewater 
[Midstream and Infrastructure Ltd.],” said Braun. Test results will 
include reservoir pressure data as well as condensate-to-gas ratios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drilling would begin in 
July 2018 but would not be completed until later in advance of the 
Tidewater facility coming onstream in the&nbsp; the second quarter of 
2019, he said after the meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Braun told shareholders 
the company is focused on keeping its drilling and completion costs down
 to about $5.5 million to $5.6 million. As the company proceeds into pad
 development north of the Wapiti, it will attempt to keep costs below $6
 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to a 
question, he said Blackbird currently is evaluating how it plans to 
raise the capital needed for the development. In addition to a reserve 
based lending facility, it could look at possibly a drilling fund or a 
joint venture project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blackbird has entered 
into a gas processing agreement with Tidewater and is in the process of 
finalizing a gathering system agreement, the meeting heard. “The 
transaction that we have struck with Tidewater is transformative because
 it allows me to profitably increase [production] to 10,000 boe/d to 
12,000 boe/d,” said Braun. “It also is the only facility that I am able 
to gain an option to obtain up to 20 per cent.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a small company such 
as Blackbird with 2,000 to 2,200 boe/d of production, the challenge was 
how it could profitably increase output in the early stages, he told 
shareholders. Braun said he had looked at other agreements and 
transactions he would have had to enter into but didn’t see they were 
viable until production was 40 mmcf/d to 50 mmc/d of gas in order to 
afford the transportation, compression and processing. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tidewater is to build a 
gas plant south of the Wapiti River to process Blackbird’s gas from 
north and south of the river. The two companies have agreed to an 
initial term of five years with firm capacity of 20 mmcf/d expected to 
be available in the second quarter of 2019, increasing to 25 mmcfd/d 12 
months after plant start-up and to 30 mmcf/d 18 months after plant 
start-up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blackbird currently has more than 4,800 boe/d of productive capacity, excluding its non-operated wells and the 3-27 well.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I am so excited about 
this deal and I am also excited [about] the way they operate because as 
they operate, we operate,” said Braun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tidewater will be 
building a gathering system to Blackbird’s compressor site, which it has
 already acquired, he said after the meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through Tidewater which 
will have multiple meters, Blackbird will have access to storage and 
buyers for its gas, he said. And while the midstreamer’s deepcut 
facility on the Alliance pipeline will reduce gas volumes as it strips 
out a deeper portion of the company’s gas, “I don’t mind having my gas 
shrunk,” said Braun, noting that it still meets Alliance specifications.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tidewater also will have 
one of the largest storage facilities for gas in northern Alberta at 
more than 100 bcf and will be one of the biggest buyers of natural gas 
likely for the next five years or so, he suggested. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Blackbird will 
continue to look at the Chicago market as a premium market for its 
natural gas, Braun said there is a risk that Marcellus gas could flood 
into the market and dilute it. “I think we have to look at what other 
markets we can penetrate and not just focus on Chicago with long-term 
contracts on Alliance.” &nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blackbird, though, does not want to dump its gas into the AECO market but to move it south, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the company has a strong ability to deliver gas, “we will immediately hedge.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blackbird has booked only
 nine per cent proved reserves and has significant lands in both its 
operated and non-operated areas that need to be re-reserved, said Braun.
 The company will be evaluating when it will implement its next reserve 
report and it’s highly likely it will do an updated reserves report, he 
said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That reserves report is 
key for [a] reserve-based lending facility,” said Braun. It also will be
 a part of the facility funding to develop Blackbird’s northern program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The key … is that we 
have been delineating two intervals where we clearly see that there are 
four areas that are developable,” he said. While the company has focused
 on the Upper and Middle Montney, at some point it likely will go after a
 Lower Montney where some of its peers having been getting exceptional 
results and which it also sees as productive, Braun told the meeting. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blackbird management estimates the company has more than 1,450 potential wells at four wells per interval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is focusing on the production of condensate with the Alberta <b>Energy</b>
 Regulator (AER) forecasting demand of more than one million bbls/d of 
the product by 2027, driven by the oilsands need for diluent, the 
meeting heard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Braun noted that on 
Wednesday Blackbird sold its condensate for C$74/bbl while Western 
Canada Select (WCS) was selling for $35.90/bbl. “That’s a significant 
benefit and in a marketplace that is challenged on gas, we positioned 
our company to be in a liquid-rich area and we are focused on a 
commodity that actually has a competitive advantage over the U.S.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2014, the junior 
has accessed significant capital and has proven that more than 114 
sections of its land are over-pressured, he said. “We are in a 
liquids-rich fairway and have already delineated two intervals.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Braun said that Blackbird
 is concerned about both extraction and its interaction with the 
community. It also is focused on operating in an environmentally 
sensitive manner.&nbsp; “And most important is what’s the <b>social licence</b> benefit we’re having.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a company imposes on a
 community, there has to be a secondary benefit back to it, he said. 
“That doesn’t mean I am just opening my cheque book and writing cheques;
 what it means is that there has to be a benefit back to the community.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pipestone battery was
 more than just a pilot project defining the liquids nature of the 
resource so that Blackbird could produce its wells, the meeting heard. 
“It was to demonstrate to the public that we could operate safely within
 the community,” said Braun. “We wanted to show this platform of safe 
operation and we could continue to develop this asset through this 
corridor.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was another great year for Growing the North, a major business conference which took place Feb. 22-23, organizers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conference drew 500 
business and municipal leaders to the ENTREC Centre at Evergreen Park, 
where they had the chance to network and listen to 16 different 
speakers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The speakers covered a wide range of topics, including farming, forestry, cannabis and geothermal, among other things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The closing talk from 
Darby Allen, Fort McMurray's fire chief at the time of the 2016 fire, 
was especially powerful, said Dan Pearcy, an organizing partner of the 
event and CEO of the Grande Prairie and District Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He struck a lot of heart strings in his conversation on what happened in Fort McMurray," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Gilliland, of <span class="companylink">Devenish Nutrition</span>,
 an Ireland-based agritechnology company, talked about how innovation 
can shape food production in the future and improve health, both of 
humans and the environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was a very scientific
 but intriguing presentation on the science behind agriculture," Pearcy 
said. Dr. Jonathan Banks, a hydrogeologist and geochemist, spoke about 
geothermal <b>energy</b> sciences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He was talking about a 
number of locations where they have geothermal that's actually siezable,
 so it was very informative and there were a lot of interested parties 
at that presentation as well," Pearcy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another speaker was Bruce
 Vincent, a third-generation logger from Montana who helped form 
Communities For A Great Northwest, a nonprofit group dedicated to "the 
intelligent use of our natural resources," according to a bio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Awesome presentation," 
Pearcy said. "He talked about how the forestry industry has regained its
 credibility in the environmental movement and how they're working to 
re-enter markets where they were previously blocked," Pearcy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The message was very 
broadbased; he didn't just hit on forestry. He talked about social 
licencing and how you ... lose access to a market if you don't have <b>social licence</b>."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Taste of the Peace 
conference, which kicks off Growing the Peace each year at the 
Stonebridge hotel, was also well attended, Pearcy said. The event, which
 samples local food, featured 15 local growers, producers and industry 
representatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chamber will start

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Ron Clayton reports</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GUATEMALAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT REQUESTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Tahoe Resources Inc</span>. has been informed 
that the Constitutional Court of Guatemala requested additional 
information in the legal case regarding Minera San Rafael's Escobal 
mining licence. The company has not yet received the formal resolution 
from the court but understands the request requires certain information 
be provided to the court within 15 business days from the date of the 
formal resolution. In addition to asking for original copies of 
documents submitted last July, some of the information requested by the 
court includes: an anthropological study of the surrounding communities 
to establish the current populations of indigenous people in San Rafael 
las Flores and several surrounding communities, a third party review of 
the Escobal environmental impact study and the mitigation measures 
required by the study, and a third party review of the Ministry of <b>Energy</b>
 and Mines' consultation process that led to the initial mining licence 
being granted in 2013. Some of the information requested appears to 
examine areas that were not appealed by any of the parties in the case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ron Clayton, Tahoe Resources' president and chief executive officer, 
said: "We are certainly disappointed with the continued delay in the 
case and the amount of time it has taken the Constitutional Court to 
request this information, but we are hopeful this means the court is 
undertaking a serious review of the issues in this case, including a 
review of indigenous populations by the Ministry of Culture and 
Compliance with International Labor Organization Convention 169. In the 
long term, ensuring that the Constitutional Court is fully informed 
about these critical issues will enhance the credibility of its final 
decision and, in turn, strengthen the company's community relationships 
and <b>social licence</b> to operate. Given that much of the information
 requested was provided as part of the initial court filings in July, 
2017, we urge the ministries, agencies and third parties to comply with 
the court's 15-day deadline and the court to provide its final ruling 
quickly thereafter. We strongly believe that the court has all the 
information legally necessary to resolve this case today, and therefore 
following receipt of this information, the court should be prepared to 
follow legal precedent by upholding the lower court's ruling to 
reinstate our licence."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company regrets that 
the termination of additional Minera San Rafael employees is now 
inevitable due to the continued delay in the legal proceedings. In 
total, approximately half of the employees will have had their contracts
 terminated as a result. Prior to the licence suspension, Minera San 
Rafael employed 1,030 people, 97 per cent of whom are Guatemalan and 50 
per cent of whom are from the Santa Rosa region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tahoe is eager to resume 
operations at Escobal to return benefit to employees, communities and 
the region. Upon receipt of a favourable resolution from the court, 
Tahoe will seek to restore its work force. For every month of delay in 
operations at Escobal, approximately $4-million in taxes and royalties 
are not being paid to the government of Guatemala and the local 
communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About <span class="companylink">Tahoe Resources Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tahoe's strategy is to 
responsibly operate mines to world standards and to develop high-quality

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, we learned 
from Scotiabank that lack of export pipeline capacity and the resulting 
discount on Canadian oil will cost the Canadian economy $15.6 billion a 
year, or nearly $43 million a day. That loss affects provincial and 
federal revenues as much as corporate income. We are all losing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also last month came the unveiling of the Trudeau government's new suite of policies for reviewing and approving major <b>energy</b> infrastructure projects, such as oil and gas pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So is there anything in 
the new rules that will address our $43-million-a-day leak to our 
Southern neighbour? Unfortunately, the answer appears to be no. The new 
process appears to further increase uncertainty for future pipeline 
proponents and investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the symbolic level, the messaging is problematic. When you replace an agency named the <span class="companylink">National <b>Energy</b> Board (NEB) </span>with
 a new agency named the Impact Assessment Agency (IAA), the message is 
clear: environmental impact is replacing economic benefit as Canada's 
primary policy focus when it comes to new <b>energy</b> projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The details are equally 
discouraging. The proposed changes broaden the number of criteria that a
 new pipeline must meet. These now include not just climate change and 
enhanced Aboriginal consultation, but also "the intersection of sex and 
gender with other identity factors." For a pipeline?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public access to panel 
hearings is also increased. Gone is the old rule that limited 
participation to individuals and groups "directly affected" by a 
proposed pipeline. Now anyone interested must be allowed to participate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This open-door policy 
will increase the opportunity for climate change activists - many of 
them heavily funded by American interests - to clog the hearing process 
with project-killing delays. These groups don't want better, safer 
pipelines. They want zero pipelines. And they know that if they cannot 
kill new pipeline projects directly, they can delay them to death with 
endless hearings, rule changes, consultations, environmental studies, 
and court challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were able to do this under the old rules, as the obituaries for Northern Gateway and <b>Energy</b> East attest. And they will certainly try to do it again under the new rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What explains this 
disappointing result? At one level, it is another example of the prime 
minister trying to have it both ways on climate change and <b>energy</b>
 development. He wants to go into next year's federal election with the 
message that he has struck a statesmanlike "balance" between these 
competing objectives. But implicit in this argument is the assumption - 
or more accurately, the delusion - that green virtue signals like carbon
 taxes and expensive renewables are going to buy "<b>social licence</b>" for the development and export of Canada's valuable oil and gas reserves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's high time to stop 
indulging that charade. We now have example after example of climate 
change activists declaring publicly that nothing Canada does to reduce 
our domestic CO2 emissions will change their resolute opposition to new 
export pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was shockingly clear
 in an interview that CBC's Power and Politics did with the American 
anti-oil activist Bill McKibbon the evening that Nebraska approved a 
routing for <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s Keystone XL pipeline. McKibbon is the founder of <span class="companylink">350.org</span>, one of largest and best funded climate change interest groups in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every Canadian should see
 thisinterview( 
http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1100225603963[http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1100225603963]
 ) for themselves, but here is a summary of the key exchanges:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interviewer: What common ground might you be able to find with the Alberta government?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McKibbon: At this point, a
 common ground can't be found... The only thing we can do is keep as 
much carbon in the ground as possible... Canada, a rich country, needs 
to keep that carbon safely underground...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interviewer: So you don't give this government any credit (for its climate change policies)?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McKibbon: Oh, I think 
they are doing a good job on the demand side... but there aren't enough 
Canadians for that to be a very big deal. The big deal is the huge pool 
of carbon that sits underneath Alberta, and that will dwarf whatever it 
is that Canada does with its own domestic emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not just the 
McKibbons of the world that are stating the obvious fact that, at two 
per cent of global emissions, what Canada does to reduce our domestic 
emissions is irrelevant to what happens globally. We are too small to 
matter. Our own homegrown McKibbon - David Suzuki - bluntly said the 
same thing recently. Delivering a speech at a Calgary's teachers 
convention, Suzuki declared: "I'm sorry Alberta, but we have to keep 
that fuel in the ground... The tar sands have to be shut down... No more
 infrastructure getting that stuff out - that means rails, pipelines, 
shipping. There's no point in investing in infrastructure when they're 
all going to be shut down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So much for <b>social licence</b>.
 As for the new Impact Assessment Agency, it's not likely to be very 
busy anyhow. Unless it is substantially amended to correct the problems 
identified above, it seems doubtful that any investors will be proposing
 a new pipeline in Canada. And don't act surprised when you learn that <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> - Canada's oldest and largest pipeline company - is already investigating moving its head office to Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And as for the $43 
million a day that we are losing, there's no end in sight. Some have 
compared our current dilemma to the National <b>Energy</b> Program, but 
at least then, Central Canadians benefited from the loss suffered by 
Western Canadians. This time, the Trudeau Liberals are giving $15.6 
billion a year to American consumers just to win the next election. No 
one in Canada benefits from NEP 2. We are all losing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Michael Binnion reports</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTERRE TO DEVELOP KAKWA NORTH ACREAGE WITH PARTNER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questerre <b>Energy</b> Corp</span>. has entered into an agreement with an experienced operator to develop its 100-per-cent-owned acreage in the Kakwa area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, president and chief executive officer of Questerre, 
commented: "The first well at Kakwa North should spud next quarter, 
subject to rig availability. Given the strong condensate production and 
low sour content from nearby wells on our joint venture acreage we are 
looking forward to the results."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He further added: "With 
this joint venture we are developing our operated acreage and preserving
 capital primarily for Quebec. We are working on our Quebec clean gas 
pilot as we wait for the release of the final regulations later this 
spring."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The farm-in partner is an
 exploration and production company with extensive operating experience 
with the Montney formation in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subject to the terms of 
the agreement, the farm-in partner has the right to drill, complete, 
equip and tie in two horizontal wells targeting the Montney formation to
 earn a 50-per-cent interest in certain acreage held by Questerre at 
Kakwa North. The partner has the option to drill, complete, equip and 
tie in additional wells to earn a similar interest in other acreage held
 by Questerre at Kakwa North and Kakwa South. Questerre will hold a 
royalty interest in these initial wells and certain subsequent wells 
subject to standard payout provisions. Questerre currently holds a 
100-per-cent interest in 4,480 acres at Kakwa North along with 3,840 
acres at Kakwa South and a 25-per-cent interest in 10,240 acres on its 
joint venture block.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questerre also reported 
on plans for additional activity targeting its shallow mineral rights, 
above and excluding Montney rights, at Kakwa North. The company was 
recently advised by the operator that it plans to drill up to six 
horizontal wells on this acreage in 2018. Questerre holds an overriding 
royalty interest in 4,160 acres of shallow rights at Kakwa North.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Questerre <b>Energy</b></span> is leveraging 
its expertise gained through early exposure to shale and other 
non-conventional reservoirs. The company has base production and 
reserves in the tight oil Bakken/Torquay of southeast Saskatchewan. It 
is bringing on production from its lands in the heart of the high 
liquids Montney shale fairway. It is a leader on <b>social licence</b> to operate issues for its Utica shale gas discovery in the St. Lawrence Lowlands, Quebec.</p>
