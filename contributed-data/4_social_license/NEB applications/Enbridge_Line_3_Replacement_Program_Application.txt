 1.     The need for the Project.
3.     The potential commercial impacts of the Project.
4.     The potential environmental and socio-economic effects of the Project, including those to be
       considered under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012.
SIMSA represents the interests of Saskatchewan industrial manufacturer, equipment and service suppliers to
increase their market share of industrial and resource projects, in particular those taking place in
Saskatchewan. Its 50 members have about 3 $billion in annual revenues, 2,000 employees and tens of
$millions in annual reinvestment in this province. SIMSA notes that the longest section of this pipeline route
is in Saskatchewan and hopes to work with Enbridge and its contractors to help local industrial suppliers have
access to the project work.
  Project Need: SIMSA supports infrastructure renewal, transportation of energy, and safety advances as part
of sustainably growing Canada's economy. Any infrastructure needs renewal or replacement for safety,
reliability and operation effectiveness reasons.
  Commercial Impacts: Energy supply is vital to our economy and a significant aspect of the economy of
western Canada from supply, transportation and consumption perspectives. This pipeline will support
marketing of Canadian energy into the future. It is also an opportunity for Saskatchewan industrial suppliers
to participate in this mega-project, take advantage of an economic development opportunity, and continue
to diversity the province's economy. This experience from this Enbridge Line 3 replacement program will
support the ability of local companies to compete in a global supply chain for pipeline and other petroleum
industry projects.
  Potential Environmental and Socio-economic Effects: Renewing the pipeline and its related safety and other
infrastructure will help continue the safe transportation of oil and protect the environment in those areas
through which is passes. Enbridge has been transparent in its project plans and responsive to enquiries.
SIMSA would like Enbridge to maximize the opportunities for Saskatchewan companies to bid on and supply
to appropriate aspects of the project through ongoing information exchange, procurement meetings, access
to the prime contractors, local procurement policies, etc. There is significant potential for local industrial
suppliers, including those SIMSA member companies that are Aboriginal-owned, to benefit from contracting
to and supplying this project. In addition to business development, there is the opportunity for related
employment, training and other socio-economic benefits.

7.     Potential impacts of the Project on Aboriginal interests.
The Piapot First Nation has recently met with representatives of Enbridge and have concluded a working
relationship will be formalized in the near future to discuss opportunities for the Band and it's Citizen's. We
have iterated to the Enbridge representatives we will openly support the L3RP.
Please aware the Intervenor Application filed by the File Hills Qu'Appelle Tribal (FHQ) representatives, Brad
Johnson and Elaine Chicoose on March 10, 2015, on behalf of the Piapot First Nation. These individuals DO
NOT have permission to speak on behalf of the Piapot First Nation Chief and Council, Elder's and Citizen's.
The FHQ Tribal Council is a non-profit organization created by the AANDC to provide services to its First
Nations entities. We have recently directed Brad Johnson to remove Piapot First Nation from the Intervenor
Application due to:
The FHQ Tribal Council contravened the governance process of the Piapot First Nation, failed to inform and
consult with the Chief and Council, Elders and Citizen's of the project, and that Piapot did not relinquish its
authority or jurisdiction to the FHQ Tribal Council by way of Band Council Resolution.

 The Canadian Association of Energy and Pipeline Landowner Associations (CAEPLA) is a federally incorporated
not-for-profit national organization representing landowners from across Canada. Its member associations
the Manitoba Pipeline Landowners Association (MPLA) and the Saskatchewan Association of Pipeline
Landowners (SAPL) are voluntary associations representing agricultural landowners directly affected by
Enbridge’s proposed Line 3 Replacement Program. CAEPLA/MPLA/SAPL members are concerned about
Enbridge’s proposal for existing Line 3 decommissioning and the potential impacts of this decommissioned
pipeline on landowners, their families and agricultural operations. These concerns relate to the still to be
developed cleaning criteria and methodology to address existing Line 3 contamination; the sufficiency of
proposed segmenting methodology and spacing to address the risks related to the pipeline becoming a
conduit for water and contaminants; current and future coating disbonding rendering cathodic protection
ineffective to prevent pipeline corrosion; and with projected corrosion, the risk of pipeline collapse under
current and increasing agricultural surface loads. Issues to be addressed by these landowners include
Enbridge’s proposed decommissioning of the existing Line 3 in place contrary to the CEPA (and NEB
endorsed) Pipeline Abandonment Matrix (Issues 6, 10); the operational and safety consequences for
landowners of the eventual corrosion and collapse of the pipe (Issues 4, 8); productivity impacts of the
resulting topsoil loss and thinning of adjacent topsoil layers (Issues 4, 8); continuing and increased pipeline
crossing restrictions and restrictions on landowners’ agricultural and non-agricultural land use (Issues 4, 8);
and health, safety, environmental and financial risks, costs and liabilities imposed upon landowners resulting
from Enbridge’s proposed existing Line 3 decommissioning (issues 4, 6, 8, 10).
CAEPLA has been in the forefront of active engagement with pipeline companies and federal and provincial
regulators to address pipeline abandonment methodology and related landowner risk exposure. CAEPLA and
its regional associations have intervened on behalf of landowner members on many NEB and provincial
regulatory hearings and, in such proceedings, have delivered extensive evidence concerning the negative
impacts of pipeline abandonment in place (see, for example, CAEPLA’s Prefiled Evidence, Reply Evidence and
Written Argument in NEB Hearing Order RH-2-2008). In this proceeding, with the assistance of counsel and
through the evidence of expert consultants and landowners, CAEPLA/MPLA/SAPL will identify and assess the
negative environmental, economic, sociological, and safety impacts which will result from Enbridge’s
proposed existing Line 3 decommissioning. CAEPLA/MPLA/SAPL will also present for the Board’s
consideration alternatives to Enbridge’s Line 3 decommissioning proposal which will better address and
mitigate these negative landowner impacts (issues 4, 6, 8, 10). CAEPLA/MPLA/SAPL will be requesting any
regulatory approval of existing Line 3 decommissioning be conditional upon implementation of appropriate
mitigation and remedial measures as addressed in CAEPLA/MPLA/SAPL’s evidence (issue 12).
Further to the Board’s correspondence of February 5/15 and Notice of Public Hearing issued with respect to
Enbridge’s Line 3 Replacement Program, CAEPLA/MPLA/SAPL respectfully requests that the Board include in
its Hearing Order provision for an oral component to the hearing with respect to these existing Line 3
decommissioning issues and directions with respect to availability of participant funding.

Calgary, (Alberta) T2R 0A8                                                                                                         2
 1.     The need for the Project.
3.     The potential commercial impacts of the Project.
4.     The potential environmental and socio-economic effects of the Project, including those to be
       considered under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012.
11. Safety and security during construction of the Project and operation of the project, including emergency
       response planning and third-party damage prevention.
The Saskatchewan Construction Association (SCA) represents the interests of Saskatchewan's construction
industry, numbering more than 11,000 employer and 53,000 workers. SCA member firms, and their
employees, will likely be engaged in significant portions of the earth-moving and construction work necessary
to complete this project. Enbridge's project will create jobs in Saskatchewan, and enhance the quality of life
for the people of this province. As such, the SCA is strongly supportive of this project proceeding on the
project timeline proposed by Enbridge.
PROJECT NEED: The project is needed to ensure that Canada's energy infrastructure is renewed and
enhanced. A more efficient, effective, and safer pipeline benefits everyone.
COMMERCIAL IMPACT: This project will create jobs and provide work for Canadian contractors and
manufacturers. The timing of this project is ideal, as it should help mitigate the impact of layoffs related to
the recent reduction in oil prices. This project is good for the national, regional, provincial, and local
economies as a result.
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC EFFECTS: A new pipeline will be safer and more efficient. This will
minimize the risk of environmental impact.
SAFETY AND SECURITY DURING CONSTRUCTION: Enbridge is proceeding with a pre-qualification process for
potential contractors, which will ensure that all companies working on the construction phase will be
qualified and able to deliver on the safety and security requirements for the project.

 1.     The need for the Project.
3.     The potential commercial impacts of the Project.
4.     The potential environmental and socio-economic effects of the Project, including those to be
       considered under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012.
Need for the Project: The Regina & District Chamber of Commerce represents over 1200 members from a
wide range of business classifications. The proposed line replacement could have a significant impact on a
number of our members most notably in the skilled trades as well as the service industry. Given the largest
section of the proposed line replacement is in southern Saskatchewan we are of the view that it will have a
positive impact on our local economy. Should the project proceed we will work with Enbridge and our
members to connect both parties.
The Regina & District Chamber of Commerce is firmly of the view that as Canadians we must do our utmost to
ensure that our infrastructure meets the needs of not only today but also tomorrow. Renewing the
infrastructure in question will go a long way toward addressing the future safety of the line as well as
environmental concerns particularly given we are talking about replacing an existing pipeline.
Commercial Impacts: The movement of energy resources is vital to the Canadian economy, particularly from
a western Canadian perspective. The pipeline will support the Canadian energy sector will into the future and
will help the country in its quest to be energy self sufficient. The project if approved would also allow major
pipe manufacturers like EVRAZ in Regina to bid on a major project which would help sustain and grow a
major Regina employer.
Potential Environmental and Socio-economic Effects: Renewing the pipeline will help to ensure that Canada's
energy supply is moved in the most environment friendly and efficient manner. Moreover the construction
and maintenance of the line will create jobs along the line which in all likelihood will include First Nations and
Metis people as well as other under representative people. In my other capacity as the Chair of the Regina
Trades and Skills Centre we would be prepared to help with some of this objective if requested.

               I am directly affected by the proposed Project
            ; I have relevant information or expertise

4.     The potential environmental and socio-economic effects of the Project, including those to be
       considered under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012.
I am the instructor for the Sustainable Energy Program at W.C. Miller Collegiate (the Collegiate) in Altona,
MB. The Collegiate is roughly 10 km from Enbridge's Gretna station. As the instructor of this provincial
education program it is my duty to teach students about the role fossil fuels play in determining the health of
our economy and our environment. I regularly take my classes to tour the Enbridge station in Gretna. I can
provide the board with expert input regarding high school students' perspectives on pipelines in general and
the Enbridge pipeline in particular.
I live in the community of Neubergthal, MB. Neubergthal, a Parks Canada, National Historic Site, is roughly 10
km from Enbridge's Gretna station. I am also a board member of the Neubergthal Heritage Foundation (NHF).
The primary purpose of the NHF is to give guidance and direction to maintaining and preserving the historic
and heritage aspects of Neubergthal. I can provide the board with input as to how Enbridge developments,
such as the lights of the Gretna station which are visible from Neubergthal, may impact the historic and
heritage values of this site.

 3.     The potential commercial impacts of the Project.
12. The terms and conditions to be included in any recommendation or approval the Board may issue for
       the Project.
Marathon Petroleum Trading Canada LLC (“MPTC”) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum
Company LP (“MPC”). MPC is a large independent refiner with operations in the United States. MPTC is
primarily engaged in the purchase of crude oil in Canada, which it delivers and sells to MPC in the United
States. MPTC supplies a significant percentage of MPC’s crude oil feedstock supply through several crude oil
export pipelines including Enbridge Pipelines, Inc. Line 3 (“Line 3”). Because of the foregoing, MPTC
respectfully submits that it is a directly affected party with respect to the matters to be considered in the
above hearing.
As a shipper on Line 3, MPTC is concerned about a reliable supply of crude oil, and also desires to be assured
of that supply via reliable transportation service. MPTC understands that replacement of Line 3 will enhance
the reliability of service and restore the operating pressure of Line 3, thereby increasing effective capacity of
Line 3. The Board’s decision on the Line 3 application will impact Marathon’s interest as an existing, long-
time shipper on the Enbridge Mainline.

3.     The potential commercial impacts of the Project.
4.     The potential environmental and socio-economic effects of the Project, including those to be
       considered under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012.
Need for the Project: The Moose Jaw & District Chamber of Commerce represents over 500 members from a
wide range of business classifications. The proposed line replacement could have a significant impact on a
number of our members --skilled trades, service industry, and education facilities to train workers. With the
number of local employees to be needed it will have a positive impact on our local economy. The Chamber
will work with both Employer and employees to contact these parties.
The Moose Jaw & District Chamber of Commerce believes that upgrading infrastructure needs will make sure
the future safety of the line as well as environmental concerns of old lines.
Commercial Impacts: Energy resources are vital to the Canadian economy, particularly from a western
Canadian perspective. There are many advantages to local businesses right from Field support to hotels,
restaurants Etc.
This impact all areas of the project as well as all other business that support the one that would be primarly
involved in the supply and construction of the line.
Potential Environment and Socio-economic Effects: Renewing the pipeline will help to ensure that Canada's
energy supply is moved in the most environment friendly and efficient manner.
With a major project like this it helps all communities in our area, from monies, to well being of the
manpower being employed.

5.     The appropriateness of the general route and land requirements for the Project.
8.     Potential impacts of the Project on landowners and land use.
11. Safety and security during construction of the Project and operation of the project, including emergency
       response planning and third-party damage prevention.
The pipeline replacement goes directly through our municipality from the furthest north west corner of the
municipality to the furthest south east. In order to maintain the integrity of the pipeline it is important that
this line is replace and decommissioned. The impacts on the farm lands and roadways could be directly
affected if the integrity of the line were in doubt.
Enbridge Pipeline has been a responsible partner in our municipality especially when it comes to maintaining
the integrity of their lines. We see no reason to not encourage this to continue
This will also bring direct commercial opportunities to the area while the replacement is going on. Our small
communities and businesses in the area will directly benefit from having this kind of construction going on in
the municipality. Many of the small businesses are looking to expand their services from the economic
spinoffs this project will bring.

 1.     The need for the Project.
3.     The potential commercial impacts of the Project.
CME has member businesses across Canada that would benefit from the supply chain opportunities created
by this project. Through the increased demand for steel and other products, this project will create additional
manufacturing activity and employment across Canada. It also creates opportunities for workforce training
and skills development, which are critical to the long-term economic competitiveness of the Canadian
economy and to attracting future investment.
The project will improve market access for Canada's energy products which will also benefit the Canadian
economy.
CME supports infrastructure renewal and improved transportation safety as important not only to the
Canadian economy, but to the health and well-being of Canadians. This project will update and increase the
capacity of energy transportation in Canada while also reducing the risk of a major spill.

The Construction Association of Rural Manitoba (CARM) represents the interests of 200 member companies
within the commercial and industrial construction industry of rural Manitoba, most significantly
southwestern Manitoba. CARM is committed to working with Enbridge to facilitate opportunities for our
members, the local suppliers, to obtain project work through the Line 3 Replacement Program. Many CARM
members have been in business for extended periods and have the knowledge, expertise and ability to
provide exceptional product and professional services for projects related to Line 3 Replacement.
In terms of project need, commercial impacts and soci-economic effects, the opportunities and benefits for
CARM membership and communities surrounding the Line 3 Replacement zone are significant and of
tremendous value to business development, economic growth, employment and training for the entire
region. Again, CARM intends to work in cooperation with Enbridge staff and contractors to ensure effective
communication and to enhance any potential project opportunities for our member companies.

 3.     The potential commercial impacts of the Project.
The existing Line 3 pipeline runs through land owned by Minnewasta Golf & Country Club in Morden,
Manitoba. Specifically, the pipeline crosses 4 fairways in middle of our golf course.
In the past, when pipeline work is in progress, (repair, new lines, etc.) there has been a significant, negative
impact on the economics of the golf course- in the case of a minor repair, we have had to limit play, or in the
case of major work, such as Line 3 replacement would be, we would have to completely shut down the
fairways involved, which then necessitates closing the complete "Front 9" of the course. Either of these
options negatively changes the Minnewasta golf experience for guests and members.
Limiting play is an annoyance, which we have learned to work around, but some golfers are distraught
enough, they choose to golf elsewhere, reducing the golf course income. Closing a complete "9" has a severe
impact on golf course income, as we are a destination course and golfers and banquet/restaurant patrons
expect the facility and course to be what it is, not a construction site. We still have potential visitors
commenting and asking questions regarding a pipeline installation from 2007.
Replacing the existing Line 3 would impact not only the course itself, but also the restaurant and banquet
facility. We could potentially lose over 60% of our annual operating revenue for golf with a similar reduction
and gross dollars impact for the banquet and restaurant.
We are in favour of decommissioning Line 3 and re-routing it, as it will reduce the incidence of line repair or
replacement, thereby reducing the impact on the golf course income and course viability.

 1.     The need for the Project.
3.     The potential commercial impacts of the Project.
The Saskatchewan Heavy Construction Association represent construction firms, suppliers and manufacturers
working withing the heavy civil construction sector in the province of Saskatchewan. We believe that there is
direct benefit to the heavy civil construction industry and a positive economic impact on the industry in
Saskatchewan if they have access to project work.
The Saskatchewan heavy civil construction sector supports over 46,000 jobs within the province of
Saskatchewan many of those within the oil and gas sector. The overall impact of our industry on
Saskatchewan's GDP is 7%. We believe the replacement and renewal of this project pipeline with enhance
the safety and support the renewal of transportation of energy.

 The Saskatchewan Chamber of Commerce (SCC) is a business advocacy organization that represents the
interests of over 10,000 businesses and other organizations within the province of Saskatchewan. In addition
to provincial and federal lobbying and advocacy activities, the SCC also conducts its own research in a wide
variety of areas to inform its opinions on what the government and private sector should be doing to help
make Saskatchewan a great place to live, work, and invest.
---The need for the project---
As a landlocked province that requires a wide variety of infrastructure options (pipelines, rail, trucking) to
export its natural resource products to world markets, the Saskatchewan Chamber of Commerce (SCC)
supports the Line 3 Replacement Program because it will improve Saskatchewan's ability to transport and sell
oil into those markets. By increasing pipeline capacity, there will also be a reduction in the amount of oil
being transported by rail, which will alleviate some of the rail capacity issues that were constraining the
export of grain, potash, and manufactured goods.
---The potential commercial impacts of the project---
Saskatchewan and its neighboring western provinces have a significant amount of their respective economic
growth that is dependent on having a thriving energy industry that is able to effectively transport and sell its
products to world markets. Whether it is the creation and growth of primary oil production companies or the
multitude of tertiary service companies that support the primary production, having an energy industry that
is growing is in the best interest of all those businesses, plus it supports the social programs that
governments pay for with oil-related tax revenues. It is critical that this piece of pipeline infrastructure is
renewed in order to support that ongoing energy sector growth by helping to reduce transportation
restraints. The actual process of the pipeline renewal itself will also create numerous immediate
opportunities for companies (equipment suppliers and construction companies) to participate in the building
of the pipeline, as well as support the workers as they build it (hotels, restaurants).
---The potential environmental and socioeconomic effects of the project---
In order to transport oil in a way that ensures continuing safety for the public, as well as the prevention of
any unnecessary environmental damage, infrastructure that is used to transport oil must be periodically
renewed. Whether pipelines or rail lines, infrastructure must be replaced and/or refreshed in order to make
sure it is continuing to meet the safety needs of the public and the capacity needs of the businesses that use
it. This renewed pipeline will fulfill both of those requirements. Also, by Enbridge actively encouraging local
businesses to participate in the construction of the pipeline, there will be an opportunity to create immediate
jobs and also expand the local expertise of Saskatchewan's businesses with these kinds of projects so they
will have a greater ability to participate in future projects.

 1.     The need for the Project.
3.     The potential commercial impacts of the Project.
The Manitoba Chambers of Commerce (MCC), as umbrella organization for 67 chambers and close to 10,000
members, has been approached by Enbridge Pipeline to file an application to be a supporter of their Line 3
replacement. The request is sitting with the National Energy Board (NEB). The proposed line replacement
could have a significant impact on a number of our members most notably in the skilled trades as well as the
service industry in southwest Manitoba, including Brandon, Winkler, Morden, etc. A section of the proposed
line replacement is in southern Manitoba, we are of the view that it will have a positive impact on the
provincial economy and the economy of the regions impacted by the work. Over the last few months,
Enbridge has called on MCC to help make introductions in the communities impacted to bring them up to
date on the process and what can be done, long-term, to help grow partnerships with the company and local
chambers. Should the project proceed we will continue to work with Enbridge, local chambers and our
members to connect all parties involved.
MCC takes the view that renewing the infrastructure in question will go a long way toward addressing the
future safety of the line as well as environmental concerns particularly given we are talking about replacing
an existing pipeline. Moreover the construction and maintenance of the line will create jobs along the line
will include locals and First Nations and Metis people as well as other under representative people,
something Enbridge is committed to do.
Enbridge has been open throughout the process of obtaining the go-ahead for this project. Our goal is to
make a lasting impact in Manitoba. Their goals are the same. They view this project and our relationship as
long-term and to the benefit of Manitoba.

 1.     The need for the Project.
3.     The potential commercial impacts of the Project.
4.     The potential environmental and socio-economic effects of the Project, including those to be
       considered under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012.
10. The suitability of the decommissioning plan for the existing Line 3 pipeline.
The Municipality of Pembina is local government in Manitoba that is home to 2,500 residents who live, work
and play in the area. With approximately 8.5 miles of proposed Line 3 Replacement pipeline right-of-way
running through the municipality, we have had a very good working relationship with Enbridge. The personal
connection with staff, to the way information is freely offered and questions gladly answered, to their
commitment to safety; Enbridge is a pleasure to work with.
Project Need: The Municipality of Pembina supports the need of the project. Infrastructure renewal is very
important and well as the safe transportation of the product. With the Line 3 Replacement Program; both
these issues will be addressed and held in the highest standards that is required.
Commercial Impacts: The supplying of energy is essential to the Canadian Economy. It helps the Western and
Central Provinces take advantage of this development, help local provincial companies and will help Canada
supply a quality product.
Socio-economical effects: The Line 3 Replacement Project will help create an economic spin off for all those
that are directly affected by the project. This means jobs will be created and maintained; and with the
commitment to safety that Enbridge insists upon, it keeps local companies in compliance with high safety
standards that they carry on to other aspects. More jobs in the community means a boost in not only the
local economy but at the provincial and federal level as well. I also have to mention that Enbridge has been
amazing to our local community clubs and other volunteer organizations. Through grants that they have
given to our local clubs and charities, many things which needed to be replaced were able to be; an example
was for one of our local Fire Departments and the ability to buy some new turn-out gear for its members.

 1.     The need for the Project.
3.     The potential commercial impacts of the Project.
4.     The potential environmental and socio-economic effects of the Project, including those to be
       considered under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012.
The Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce represents over 2,000 businesses in Winnipeg that span all relevant
sectors within the overall business community. Our members' interest are served through the Line 3
Replacement Program in a number of ways. The efficient, cost effective, and safe movement of energy
resources across Canada and throughout North America is critically important to both our national and
regional economies. When we talk about critical infrastructure we must include energy infrastructure as a
priority for refurbishment and replacement. Our membership is concerned about the environmental risk of
using old pipeline technology and is supportive of ensuring we install the latest technology. We are also
supportive of the economic opportunities and job creation that come from this type of new installation.
Additionally, the increasing movement of oil and gas by rail has created concerns within other sectors as their
commodities compete for rail capacity with the exponential increase in the volumes of oil and gas. Good
pipeline technology will not only free up more space on rail but will also reduce the emerging risk of high
speed trains travelling through our cities and communities throughout Western Canada with volatile cargo.
The economic, environmental, and socio-economic advantages are all in the best interest of our member
organizations.

Environment Canada participation will be based on matters directly related to the Department’s mandate.
The Environment Canada mandate is determined by the statutes it administers including the Department of
the Environment Act; the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999; the Species at Risk Act; the
Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994; and the pollution prevention provisions of the Fisheries Act.
Environment Canada also has a lead role in supporting the Government of Canada’s implementation of the
Federal Policy on Wetland Conservation. Environment Canada’s legal authorities related to environmental
emergencies are inherent to the Department’s creation in 1971 under the Department of the Environment
Act. Since that time, the Department’s legal authorities related to environmental emergencies have been
broadened by the pollution prevention provisions of the Fisheries Act; the Migratory Birds Convention Act,
1994; the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA), 1999; the Emergency Management Act, 2007; and
the Federal Policy for Emergency Management (2009) (federal departmental planning responsibilities for
prevention/mitigation of, preparedness for, response to, and recovery from emergencies).

3.     The potential commercial impacts of the Project.
5.     The appropriateness of the general route and land requirements for the Project.
8.     Potential impacts of the Project on landowners and land use.
11. Safety and security during construction of the Project and operation of the project, including emergency
       response planning and third-party damage prevention.
Potential Commercial Impacts:
The Municipality of Rhineland represents the interest of residents, business and agricultural within the
municipality including the two towns of Plum Coulee and Gretna. There is an Enbridge pump station and
tank farm near the Town of Gretna. The project has many economical benefits to our area directly including
property tax revenues, increase in the use of local service industry's such as hotels, campgrounds, restaurants
etc. This line 3 replacement will create jobs for our commercial, and industrial business's. The project
supports the local economy by injecting dollars that have a direct impact to existing business, and new
business development.
Appropriateness of the Route:
Rhineland supports the proposed route as Enbridge has addressed all our concerns on our right of ways for
line 3 replacement.
Potential Impacts on landowners:
As an affected landowner the municipality believes that this project will a create many positive impacts.
Safety:
We have an interest in the safe operation of the Line 3 pipeline and our hope is that the replacement of the
pipeline will reduce the number of integrity digs that are currently take place along the pipeline route.
We support pipeline infrastructure renewal in our municipality and our council believes that the
transportation of energy is essential to grow Canada's economy in that it creates jobs. The Municipality has
had a very good working relationship with Enbridge in the past and feels that this project will continue to
improve the relationship. Enbridge has an excellent safety reputation and we see that in the location in our
municipality. Enbridge has been transparent in the project plans and has done a excellent job of ensuring the
process is understood and that if we have questions or concerns that they have been answered. The line 3
replacement program will be beneficial to our area.

3. The potential com mercial impacts of the Project.
5. The appropriateness of the general route and land requirements for the Projea.
11. Safety and security during construction of the Project and operation of the project, i ncluding emergency
response planning and third-party damage prevention.
3. The project has many economic benefits to our region with the location of workers and resources into our
area which utilize the campgrounds, hotels, restaurants, grocers, fuel suppliers ..etc. The commercial activity
that is generated extends to many areas in an indirect manner as well such as automotive and equipment
repair shops, retail services and providers as well as through the hiring of sub~trades and local contractors;
welders, trucking outfits, gravel/aggregate, etc. The ability to move oil, in and of itself has far reaching
commercial economic impacts for not only our municipality, but the province and country, as it contin ues to
serve as a crucial source of energy and revenue. '
5. Enbridge has been in continual communication with the RM of Stanley in regards to the newly planned
route for the line 3 project. The RM is satisﬁed with the route that Enbridge has chosen. The Enbridge
pipeline crosses many municipal ROW's and Enbtidge has proven to ensure these crossings are com pieted
appropriately and to the Municipality's satisfaction.
11. Enbridge has proven to Operate safely within our area, the municipality has no concerns with safety and
security during the construction project and operation of the project. Enbridge has provided fu nding to the
local emergency se rvices and worked closely with them in the past.
The RM of Stanley supports the pipeline infrastructure renewal throughout our municipality. RM of Stanley
has enjoyed a very good working relationship with Enbridge in the past and feel this will continue. Enbridge
co mmunicates extremely well with the Municipality and is continually updating us on what is happening and 3
requesting our feedback on their Operations. The Municipality views the line 3 replacement program as a
benefit to our area. ’ ,

                                      Connection to Project Issues
1.     The need for the Project.
3.     The potential commercial impacts of the Project.
4.     The potential environmental and socio-economic effects of the Project, including those to be
       considered under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012.
8.     Potential impacts of the Project on landowners and land use.
11. Safety and security during construction of the Project and operation of the project, including emergency
       response planning and third-party damage prevention.
Through Enbridge's consultation process, Enbridge has provided an abundance of information in relation to
the Line 3 Replacement Program and has addressed any issues or concerns that the Municipality has in
relation to this project. This project will bring an economic injection to the Municipality. The sooner this
project begins the better. The Municipality has an interest in the safe operation of the Line 3 pipeline and
this will benefit from the reduced impact associated with any additional integrity digs along the Line 3
pipeline route. Enbridge has been a good neighbour and has been open to engaging with the Municipality
since the outset of this project.

          Replacement Program Settlement, Schedules 8        —  Weed Management and 9    —  Clubroot
         Biosecurity Agreement)
2.2      Pipeline depth monitoring
         Following the conclusion of Line 3 decommissioning construction, Enbridge’s Pipeline
         Depth Monitoring Program (“PDMP”) will apply to the decommissioned Line 3 pipeline
         and all decommissioned or abandoned Mainline Corridor pipelines on the Landowner’s
         property, and En bridge will adhere to its PDMP and any applicable obligations under
         Section 2.3(b), below, to resolve any failure to maintain depth of cover by instituting
         appropriate mitigation measures, including, at Enbridge’s option:
         (a)      restoring depth of cover to a minimum 0.6 metres;
         (b)      otherwise implementing mitigative measures so as to ensure continuance of
                  ordinary cultivation and safe crossing of the Landowner’s farming equipment over
                  the pipeline(s); or
         (c)      with respect to cultivated lands and with the Landowner’s agreement, paying
                  compensation for any resulting crop loss or other direct damage.
2.3       Pipeline crossing
          Enbridge grants permission to the Landowner to cross the decommissioned Line 3
          pipeline and all decommissioned or abandoned Mainline Corridor pipelines on the
          Landowner’s property at any time with all agricultural equipment to carry out cultivation
          of the lands in accordance with Enbridge’s Agricultural Equipment Crossing Tool,
          attached hereto as Schedule 2. If at any time, Enbridge determines that the Landowner
          cannot cross the decommissioned Line 3 pipeline or any decommissioned or abandoned
          Mainline Corridor pipeline on the Landowner’s property with certain agricultural
          equipment Enbridge will:
          (a)      specify to the Landowner the restricted equipment or practice;
          (b)      where applicable, implement mitigation measures so as to ensure the safe
                   crossing of the Landowner’s farming equipment and practices over the
                   pipeline(s); or
          (C)      with respect to cultivated lands and with the Landowners agreement, pay
                   compensation for any resulting crop loss or other direct damages.
          Notwithstanding any permission granted in this section, Enbridge will not be liable for
          any damages, claims, suits or actions resulting from the gross negligence or wilful
           misconduct of the Landowner, its employees, agents, or other persons for whom the
           Landowner is responsible.
 2.4       Future subsidence/drainage issues
           In the event that the continued presence of Enbridge’s decommissioned or abandoned
           Mainline Corridor pipeline causes subsidence in excess of 2-inches on agricultural lands,
           Enbridge will, in consultation with the Landowner, restore the affected area to grade by
  126605/472266
  MT DOCS 14420309                                   2
         re-stripping topsoil and re-grading the subsoils or by applying other restorative
        techniques. In certain localized areas, importation of topsoil may be undertaken.
        Enbridge will make reasonable efforts to consult with and obtain the consent of the
        Landowner before importing topsoil, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.
        Imported topsoil must be of a similar quality to the existing topsoil, from a source within
        reasonable proximity of the worksite, and approved by the Landowner.
        In the event of other future diminishment of drainage system functionality caused by the
        continued presence of Enbridge’s decommissioned or abandoned Mainline Corridor
        pipeline, Enbridge will repair, restore and maintain all drainage system functionality to
        as-found condition.
        Enbridge agrees to restore all such affected lands to equivalent previous productivity so
        far as is reasonably practicable and except as already compensated by Enbridge
        pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise. Where reasonably requested by the
        Landowner, Enbridge will retain an independent soils consultant satisfactory to both
        parties to develop a prescription to rectify the problem, having reference to the crop
        performance protocol set out in Schedule 3. This may include the importation of topsoil
        and other restorative techniques. Landowners agree to provide Enbridge with
         reasonable access for the collection of samples in a control area off of Enbridge’s
        easement for the purpose of implementing the protocol set out in Schedule 3.
2.5      Contamination
        Where contamination is encountered on the Line 3 right-of-way during Line 3
        decommissioning construction or in the future with respect to all decommissioned or
         abandoned Mainline Corridor pipelines on the Landowner’s property, and subject to
         regulatory requirements at the time the contamination is encountered, Enbridge will
         implement the Contaminated Soils Discovery Contingency Plan in Appendix D10 to the
         EPP filed with the NEB as part of the Application (NEB file number OF-Fac-Oil-E101-
         2014-11 02), and retain an independent consultant to carry out tests to assess and
         prescribe remediation for soils contaminated as a result of Enbridge’s operations.
         Enbridge will implement all commercially reasonable measures recommended by the
         independent consultant to remediate contaminated soils.
3.       Decommissioning and abandonment research
3.1      Funding for research
         Enbridge will fund independent, third-party research on decommissioning at a Canadian
         university mutually agreed to by the parties (the “Research”). It is anticipated that the
         Research will consist of funding for three PhD students. The Research will study the
         impacts of decommissioning and abandoning pipelines in place, with a view to further
         defining the associated risks. The Research will include investigations of corrosion,
         subsidence, and structural integrity.
3.2      Research to be filed with the NEB
         Enbridge will file with the NEB any final report produced by the Research, Enbridge will
         also file an application with the NEB seeking approval for any Enbridge-proposed
         changes to the Plan that result from the Research.

 3.3      CAEPLA participation
         CAEPLA will participate jointly with Enbridge in the Research, and CAEPLA’s
         participation will include:
         (a)      CAEPLA will review Enbridge’s proposed terms of reference for the Research,
                  provide comment to Enbridge, and resolve with Enbridge terms of reference;
         (b)      CAEPLA will review any interim data or reports in respect of the Research,
                  provide comment to Enbridge, and resolve with Enbridge as necessary
                  supplementary directions for continuing Research; and
         (c)      CAEPLA will review any final data or reports in respect of the Research, provide
                  comment to Enbridge, and consult with Enbridge to resolve the final form of data
                  or reports.
3.4      Enbridge funding for CAEPLA participation
         CAEPLA will provide Enbridge with proposed budgets for CAEPLA’s participation in the
         Research as described above in section 3.3. Enbridge will reimburse the reasonable
         cost of CAEPLA’s participation in the Research in the amount of $150,000 plus GST per
         year for three years, or such greater amount as may be agreed by the parties. Such
         reimbursements may be accelerated at CAEPLA’s option, such that more than $150,000
         plus GST is reimbursed in the first or second year and less thereafter. Reimbursements
         will be paid by Enbridge within 30 days of receipt of CAEPLA’s costs invoices.
3.5      Additionally, within 90 days of the execution of the within agreement, Enbridge will
         provide CAEPLA with a one-time payment of $300,000 to fund CAEPLA’s participation in
         the Research. This payment will be made after CAEPLA has reviewed Enbridge’s
         proposed terms of reference for the Research and provided comment to Enbridge, as
         described above in section 3.3(a). If CAEPLA reports this payment appropriately and is
         assessed GST on same, Enbridge will reimburse the GST upon receipt of the relevant
         tax filings and any documents pertaining to the assessment.
3.6      CAEPLA will use the $250,000 Decommissioning Study Payment paid pursuant to
         section 9.3 of the CAEPLAIMPLA/SAPL-Enbridge Line 3 Replacement Program
         Settlement to pay all costs associated with the technical consultants that it retained in
         connection with negotiation of this Agreement. For the sake of clarity, and
         notwithstanding any previous agreement, Enbridge will not be responsible for any of
         these costs incurred up to the date of this agreement.
3.7      Following the conclusion of the Research, Enbridge will reimburse CAEPLA’s
         reasonable costs of analyzing the results of the Research, determining what further
         measures, if any, should be taken in respect of Line 3 decommissioning, and
         participation in further consultation with Enbridge. Such reimbursement will be capped at
         a maximum aggregate amount of $100,000 plus GST, or such greater amount as may
         be agreed by the parties. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, En bridge will not be
         responsible for the cost of CAEPLA’s participation in any NEB regulatory proceedings.

   4.        Pre-payment of decommissioning damages
 4.1        Pie-payment of decommissioning damages
            If Enbridge receives the documents described below in section 4.2 before August 1,
           2015, Enbridge will provide the Landowner with a one-time pre-payment against any
           decommissioning damages (the “Linear Damages Pre-Payment”), subject to the
           following terms:
           (a)      The amount of the Linear Damages Pre-Payment will be $17 for every linear
                     meter of the Line 3 pipeline that is decommissioned on the Landowner’s
                    property;
           (b)      Enbridge will have the right to apply the Linear Damages Pre-Payment to set off
                    any damages due and payable that are caused by:
                    (i)     the decommissioning of the Line 3 pipeline, other than those damages
                            identified in the Preliminary Field Right of Way Report for
                            decommissioning construction; or
                    (ii)    the continued presence of a decommissioned Line 3 pipeline on the
                            Landowner’s property or the property of a successor in title to the
                            Landowner.
                    For the sake of greater certainty, if the damages described above in sections
                   4.1(b)(i) and (ii) are due and payable by Enbridge to the Landowner, the Linear
                    Damages Pre-Payment will be credited against the amount due and payable,
                   such that there will be no right of action against Enbridge until the aggregate of
                   the damages described above in sections 4.1(b)(i) and (ii) exceeds the Linear
                   Damages Pre-Payment.
          (c)      Enbridge will be responsible for remitting the Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) on
                   the Linear Payment, and no amount in respect of GST will be paid to the
                   Landowner.
4.2      Enbridge will not be obliged to pay the Linear Damages Pre-Payment to a Landowner
         until it has received the following documents from that Landowner in a form satisfactory
         to Enbridge, acting reasonably:
         (a)       Executed agreements (including as applicable, easement amending agreements
                   and such other documentation as necessary or desirable in relation to Line 3
                   decommissioning); and
         (b)       an executed release in respect of the Linear Damages Pre-Payment.
4.3      If Enbridge does not receive a Landowner’s documents prior to August 1, 2015, it will
         have no obligation to pay the Linear Damages Pre-Payment to that Landowner.

MT DOCS 14420309                                      5
        CAEPLA, MPLA, and SAPL, and their Landowner members (on behalf of whom they act
       as agents) acknowledge and agree that they will support the Application, NEB File
        Number OF-Fac-Oil-E101-2014-1 1 02, and they will not engage in any further opposition
        of any kind in relation to Line 3 decommissioning, subject to the exceptions below. In
        particular, the Landowner:
        (a)      will not interfere directly or indirectly with Enbridge’s immediate access to the
                 Landowners’ lands for the purposes of conducting environmental and other
                 surveys;
        (b)      will permit Enbridge reasonable access to the Landowner’s lands for the purpose
                 of Plan activities, including Line 3 decommissioning construction and ongoing
                 monitoring;
        (C)      will not participate in the public hearing process for the Application in respect of
                 Line 3 decommissioning, unless reasonably requested by Enbridge to provide
                 written support, in which case said support will be provided; and
         (d)     will make reasonable efforts to make themselves readily available to accept
                 service of regulatory documents, or else consent in writing to substituted service
                 on a reasonably available individual.
         If, however, the Landowner is entitled to compensation for damages as contemplated in
         sections 2.1 hereof, the Landowner reserves the right to have compensation for
         damages determined in accordance with the Integrity Dig Procedure attached as
         Schedule 1. Failure to execute and deliver the documents set out in section 4.2 to
          Enbridge on or before August 1, 2015 will forfeit the Landowner’s entitlement to receive
         the Linear Damages Pre-Payment.
          None of the foregoing will prohibit the Landowner from making representations to the
          NEB with respect to the ways in which the Plan might be amended in light of the findings
          of the Research.
5.2       CAEPLA’s obligation to withdraw its intervention
          Within five days of the execution of the within agreement, CAEPLA will:
          (a)     File the Agreement with the NEB;
          (b)     Advise the NEB in writing that CAEPLAIMPLAISAPL and their landowner
                  members’ concerns about the approval of the Plan have been resolved; and
          (c)     Advise the NEB forthwith that CAEPLA is withdrawing from further participation in
                  the hearing before the NEB in respect of the Plan, effective immediately.
5.3       CAEPLA/MPLA/SAPL’s obligation to assist in obtaining Landowner support
           CAEPLA, MPLA, and SAPL will make best efforts to ensure that all of their members
           execute and deliver the documents set out in section 4.2 to Enbridge on or before
           August 1,2015.

   5.4      Consent to decommissioning to be included in easement amending agreements
           Landowners agree to execute an easement amending agreement in the applicable form
           attached as Schedule 4, which incorporates the Plan by reference.
  5.5      Landowner’s obligation to communicate settlement
           The Landowner will promptly provide written notice of the Agreement to any occupant,
          tenant, or lessee of this settlement (and the relevant easement agreement), and will
           simultaneously forward a copy of such notice to Enbridge at the address for notices set
          out in the relevant easement agreement.
          The Landowner will also provide written notice of the Agreement to any immediate
          successor in title upon transfer of title, and will simultaneously forward a copy of such
          notice to Enbridge at the address for notices set out in the relevant easement
          agreement.
 5.6      Landowner’s obligation to pay any sums due to occupants, tenants, or lessees
          All payments pursuant to the Agreement will be made directly to the registered
          Landowner. The Landowner is responsible for making any payment due to an occupant,
          tenant, or lessee in respect of anything for which compensation is paid pursuant to the
         Agreement.
 6.      Assignment and authority
 6.1     Assignment
         All rights and obligations contained in this agreement will extend to, be binding upon,
         and inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns
         of the parties hereto respectively. For the sake of greater certainty, Enbridge will be
         entitled to apply the Linear Damages Pre-Payment to set off any of the damages
         described in Section 4.1(b), above, even if those damages are realized by a successor
         in title to the Landowner and the Linear Damages Pre-Payment was made to the
         successor’s predecessor in title.
6.2      Authority
         CAEPLAMPLA/SAPL confirm that they enter into the Agreement on behalf of the
         Landowners.

                  INTEGRITY DIG POLICY AND PROCEDURES ON PRIVATE LANDS
         INVESTIGATIVE DIG PROCESS FOR LANDOWNERS
Enbridge Pipelines Inc. (herein referenced as Enbridge or “we”) is a world leader in pipeline design,
construction, safety and reliability. In order to maintain the integrity of our system, Enbridge utilizes
state of the art technology to identify potential pipeline anomalies.
Enbridge periodically uses specialized internal inspection devices called “Smart Pigs” that travel
through its pipelines collecting data. The data is then analyzed to determine if there are areas of
concern requiring further investigation. If any anomalies are detected, this section of the pipeline is
excavated and the pipeline is examined to determine if repairs are required.
Enbridge is committed to responsible behaviour while completing required maintenance work on the
property of the landowner (herein referenced as the landowner or ‘you”). We meet this commitment
by:
     •   Ensuring landowners are treated fairly and consistently and compensated for certain impacts
         that may occur;
     •   Identifying any special considerations you may have in advance of the work and responding
         accordingly;
     •   Planning the work in a manner that minimizes the level of inconvenience to you;
     •   Maintaining contact with you throughout the process to ensure concerns are addressed and so
         that you are aware of how the work is proceeding;
     •   Ensuring safety in every aspect of the maintenance work while it is performed;
     •   Respecting the environment by complying with regulatory requirements and Company
         Environmental Policies and Procedures.
 LANDOWNER CONTACT/PRELIMINARY FIELD RIGHT OF WAY REPORT
 When work on the pipeline is required on your land, an Enbridge representative will make reasonable
 efforts to contact you a minimum of 7 days in advance of any work being conducted, and Enbridge
 will comply with all applicable notice requirements under the National Energy Board Act. At this
 time, an Enbridge representative will arrange for land access and provide estimated compensation,
 preferred timing of the work, any environmental or safety considerations, and address any other
 questions or concerns you may have. The Enbridge representative will complete a Preliminary Field
 Right-of-Way Report documenting issues discussed with you. You will have the option to receive any
 estimated compensation in advance of the work. The Enbridge Land Agent will also discuss whether
 you wish to have periodic up-dates and advise as to how you can reach an Enbridge Representative
 should the need arise.
 126605/472266
 MT DOCS 14420309                                   1
  In agricultural areas, Enbridge will make reasonable attempts to schedule work activities in a manner
 that minimizes interference with agricultural operations. Enbridge prefers to access its dig sites in a
 manner that minimizes disturbance to your crops. Enbridge also prefers to conduct the work from
 April to December. If Enbridge activity extends outside of this window, you are entitled to receive
 additional compensation in accordance with the terms set out below in the Compensation section. If
 temporary workspace or access is required, Enbridge will discuss and make arrangements with you in
 advance of commencing the work and compensate you in accordance with the form of Preliminary
 Field Right of Way Report below. Enbridge will identify your primary agricultural access, Enbridge’s
 proposed access route, and Enbridge’s integrity dig site on the Preliminary Field Right of Way Report.
 The landowner acknowledges that Enbridge has the right under its existing easements to access its
 right of way across the easement lands at any time, and to access its right of way across other lands
when it requires emergency access for the purpose of maintaining its pipelines and related facilities.
Nothing in this agreement limits Enbridge’s rights under its easement agreements.
 In urgent or emergency situations or in situations where pipeline anomalies require immediate
attention, Enbridge will attempt to contact the landowner or tenant, if any. However if you or your
tenant, if any, cannot be contacted, access and work will proceed in order to minimize potential
hazards to you, the public and the environment.
Enbridge will be authorized to conduct its integrity dig or digs for a period of 24 months from the
commencement of excavation at a particular dig site, following which, it will seek your consent to an
extension of the time to complete its integrity dig or digs, except in the event of an urgent or
emergency situation, in which case Enbridge will be authorized to continue its integrity dig or digs.
Enbridge will determine whether a particular integrity dig is urgent or an emergency in its sole
discretion, acting reasonably.
Before commencing an integrity dig, Enbridge will undertake soil sampling and testing in accordance
with its Clubroot Biosecurity Agreement to determine the presence of clubroot on your property.
Enbridge will provide these test results to you, and it will take measures to mitigate the risk of
spreading clubroot in accordance with its Clubroot Biosecurity Agreement.
At the conclusion of its integrity dig, Enbridge will provide you with a summary report, if requested,
which will include a description of the affected pipeline(s) and the general nature of the work
performed.
EXCAVATION I POST EXCAVATION
Access routes. livestock and fencing concerns are addressed with the landowner, prior to commencing
work. The access route to dig sites is typically not stripped of topsoil unless requested by the
landowner. Where the Landowner, acting reasonably, requests topsoil stripping of the access route to
the dig site, and such stripping is possible, the access area will be stripped to allow equipment to travel
on subsoil. The topsoil will be stored adjacent to the access road. Enbridge representatives will stake
out the location of the excavation, the pipelines and the access route depending on the length and
location.
126605/472266
MT DOCS 14420309                                   2
   Except in the case of an urgent or emergency situation requiring immediate action, Enbridge will
  follow its Wet! Thawing Soils Procedure in the Environmental Guidelines for Construction as filed
 with the National Energy Board.
 The area of the excavation is then stripped of topsoil, which is stored separately from the sub-soil.
  Once the pipeline is excavated, the pipe coating is removed, the pipe is cleaned via abrasive blasting
 and the pipeline anomaly is inspected. Once inspected, the pipe may need to be repaired either by
 removing and replacing that portion of the pipe or by installing a sleeve over the damaged portion of
 the pipe to restore its integrity. The abrasive blast media and pipe coating will be collected, removed
 and properly disposed of in accordance with regulatory requirements.
 During the dig, if Enbridge determines that additional space and/or temporary workspace is needed,
 Enbridge will make reasonable attempts to notify the Landowner for consent prior to expanding the
 workspace and will compensate the landowner for such lands in accordance with the base
 compensation values set out in the form of Preliminary Field Right of Way Report below.
 Enbridge will repair, restore and maintain all drainage system functionality to as-found condition. This
 work will be completed consistent with the criteria as set out below. Drainage is maintained as
 required for the duration of the work.
 (i) Excavating under Drain Tiles
                 -
                         If drain tiles are cut during excavation Enbridge will:
                         •       identify the location of the damaged tile;
                         •       install a temporary flume if needed to maintain drainage;
                         •       cap the ends to prevent clogging drains with dirt or debris;
                         •       keep plugs in place until the damaged tile is repaired
(ii) Backfilling under Drain Tiles
                 -
                         Before backfilling, Enbridge will determine whether any drain tiles crossed
                         during excavation were damaged during the work. Enbridge will use a sewer
                         rod or pipe snake to probe open ends of tiles and will repair any damaged tiles
                         by inserting a competent support (e.g., length of solid pipe) around the tile to
                        prevent settling. If damage is extensive, broken tile will be removed and replace
                         with new tile.
                         Drain tiles damaged during the work must be repaired to their pre-work
                        condition or better.
                         Enbridge will backfill around drain tiles in lifts and compact each lift.
Once the pipeline is repaired, the pipe’s coating is replaced and the excavation is backfilled and
compacted and the topsoil is replaced and the site is returned to its original grade. Where required
Enbridge will chisel plow and/or disc the area of excavation and the access road, or alternatively,
where requested Enbridge will provide reasonable compensation to the landowner to perform such
work.
126605/472266
MT DOCS 14420309                                     3
 The site is monitored for subsidence for approximately 1 year after completion of the integrity dig with
additional remediation performed if required. If following return to grade, there is subsidence in
excess of 2-inches, Enbridge will, in consultation with the landowner, restore the affected area to grade
by re-stripping topsoil and re-grading the subsoils or by applying other restorative techniques. In
certain localized areas, importation of topsoil may be undertaken. Enbridge will make reasonable
efforts to consult with and obtain the consent of the landowner before importing topsoil, which consent
is not to be unreasonably withheld. Imported topsoil must be of a similar quality to the existing
topsoil, from a source within reasonable proximity of the dig site, and approved by the landowner.
If Enbridge’s integrity dig causes a restriction of the natural flow of water due to too much or not
enough subsidence, Enbridge will restore to pre-work contours and drainage.
During construction on its integrity dig, if Enbridge encounters a material quantity of water in the
immediate vicinity of the excavation area. Enbridge will make reasonable efforts to obtain the consent
of the affected landowner, which consent is not to be unreasonably withheld, to employ reasonable and
appropriate dewatering and silt filtration measures. If consent cannot be obtained despite Enbridge’s
reasonable efforts, Enbridge will employ reasonable and appropriate dewatering and silt filtration
measures. In the event that Enbridge’s integrity dig causes discharged water to impact lands other than
 lands previously identified in lEnbridge’s Preliminary Field Right of Way Report for its access route,
 dig site, and temporary workspace, Enbridge will pay compensation for such lands as crop loss in
 accordance with the base compensation values contained in the form of Preliminary Field Right of
 Way Report below. Should Enbridge require additional temporary workspace for dewatering
 equipment, such as pumps or hoses, Enbridge will pay compensation for such lands as temporary
 workspace in accordance with the compensation values contained in the form of Preliminary Field
 Right of Way Report below, and this will constitute full compensation for the use of temporary
 workspace to dewater.
 Enbridge will remove stones to achieve equivalence with the surrounding subsoil/ topsoil as well as
 stones from the upper 30 cm of soil that will interfere with topsoil replacement or cultivation (i.e.
 stones larger than 1 0 cm in diameter).
 Enbridge will remove any stakes that it drove and will repair to equivalent state or replace any fences
 that it opened to facilitate access. Enbridge will make reasonable efforts to ensure reasonable passage
  and access for agricultural equipment during integrity digs. Enbridge may erect signage in connection
  with its integrity dig, including signage for emergency vehicles. Insofar as reasonably practicable and
  safe, using good construction practices, and in compliance with all applicable bylaws, regulations, and
  enactments, Enbridge will limit the placing of signs that impede traffic on public roads near the access
  to its integrity dig. Enbridge will remove its signage as soon as reasonably practicable following the
  conclusion of its integrity dig.
  Enbridge will work to avoid tree removal off the right-of-way to the extent practical if requested by the
  Landowner. Should it be necessary to remove a tree or trees off the right-of-way, and at the request of
  the Landowner, Enbridge will replace ornamental or planted shelter belt trees in areas outside the
  pipeline easement on a 1:1 ratio, and will do so in a manner satisfactory to the landowner, acting
  reasonably. Replacement of trees will be limited to ornamental or planted shelterbelt trees and will not
  be applied to trees in forested or treed pasture. If Enbridge removes an ornamental or planted shelter
   126605/472266
   MT DOCS 14420309                                4
 belt tree that is more than 2 m high, it will provide a replacement tree that is approximately 2 m high.
If Enbridge removes an ornamental or planted shelter belt tree is less than 2 m high it will provide a
nursery stock size tree as replacement. In lieu of providing a replacement tree, Enbridge may, at its
election, pay the cost of the tree that it would otherwise have provided.
Where Enbridge removes woodlot trees off the right-of-way, it will pay compensation as crop loss,
unless it determines that the fair market value of the felled timber exceeds the amount paid for crop
loss, in which case Enbridge will pay the fair market value of the felled timber. Where Enbridge and
the landowner cannot reach consensus as to the fair market value of the felled timber, such fair market
value will be determined by a jointly retained, independent and appropriately qualified appraiser
satisfactory to both parties. If Enbridge’s offer of fair market value is at least 10% lower than the
findings of the parties’ appraiser, Enbridge will agree to pay the costs of the appraiser; otherwise the
costs of the appraiser are to be borne by the landowner.
Enbridge and its contractors use different equipment to expose, investigate, repair and restore the soil
in the disturbed areas. These include: excavators, dozers, an abrasive blasting truck, a coating truck,
pick-up trucks, Gators / all-terrain vehicles, and compactors.
Depending on the time of year when the work is completed, spring cleanup may be required. An
Enbridge representative will discuss this with you.
COMPENSATION
Enbridge possesses the right to maintain its pipelines and facilities in accordance with the easement
agreement. Enbridge however is responsible to the landowner for damages resulting from the work
conducted. Enbridge will compensate you for damage in accordance with the terms of the easement
agreement registered on the title to your land and where applicable, the National Energy Board Act.
These damages generally include damages to any crops, tile drains, fences, timber, culverts, bridges
and lanes. In addition Enbridge will compensate for any additional land rights required to facilitate the
work and any inconvenience suffered. Compensation for any dig site will be based upon a minimum
of a half-acre of disturbance per site.
Payments will vary according to the fair market value of the crop loss incurred, the area of damage and
any inconvenience to you. Estimated damages for planned maintenance activities will be documented
on the Preliminary Field Right-of-Way Report prior to work proceeding. Normally payments are made
upon completion of work when damages can be properly assessed, however, you will have the option
of receiving these estimated damages prior to Enbridge conducting its work. Upon completion of the
work, an Enbridge representative will make reasonable efforts to contact you within 60 days. If
additional damages were incurred, compensation will be provided to you.
 If Enbridge activity is conducted between January and March, Enbridge will pay to the landowner
 150% of the base crop loss and base disturbance compensation payable in accordance with the
Preliminary Field Right of Way Report.
 Damages to specialty crops (i.e. produce, registered seed variety, potatoes) will be reviewed and
compensated by Enbridge on a site specific basis. Damages to non-annual crops such as alfalfa or
 126605/472266
 MT DOCS 14420309                                   5
 pasture will be negotiated for total losses and will be restored to production. If Enbridge and the
landowner cannot agree on the compensation to be paid for a specialty crop or non-annual crop, such
compensation will be determined by a jointly retained, independent and qualified consultant
satisfactory to both parties. If Enbridge’s offer of compensation for a specialty crop or non-annual
crop is at least 5% lower than the findings of the consultant, Enbridge will agree to pay the full
expense of the consultant.
Enbridge will endeavor to complete each dig within 45 days of commencing the work. Should this not
occur, you are entitled to receive additional compensation due to the increased inconvenience of 150%
of the base crop loss and base disturbance damages payable in accordance with the Preliminary Field
Right of Way Report.
In wet weather conditions and in recognition of Enbridge’s wet soils shut down provisions, additional
work time may be required. If such conditions are encountered, the time to complete will be extended
by the length of time that the conditions exist. Where dig activities are undertaken by Enbridge in wet
soil conditions and top soil has not been stripped, Enbridge will pay to the landowner compensation of
150% of the loss and base disturbance compensation in accordance with the Preliminary Field Right of
Way Report.
The landowner is asked to acknowledge completion of work, and any compensation by signing a
standard receipt and release form. The release is specific to the work conducted and addresses damages
up to the date of signature. If there are any subsequent problems associated with the work, Enbridge
remains responsible to rectify the problems.
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
Protecting the environment, compliance with regulatory requirements and maintaining good landowner
relations are of primary importance to Enbridge. Careful and effective planning ensures compliance
with environmental regulations, public and landowner concerns are addressed and potential adverse
impacts are identified.
All dig sites are assessed to determine if there are any environmental issues or restrictions. Work
within environmentally sensitive areas must be planned on a site-specific basis and special mitigating
measures taken to minimize potential impacts. Enbridge will ensure that all necessary licenses, permits
and approvals are in place prior to commencing work. Additionally, the independent construction
auditor described in Enbridge’s Clubroot Biosecurity Agreement will assess Enbridge’s compliance
with its biosecurity and other obligations in respect of its integrity digs.
If Enbridge’s integrity dig site is located within 50 m of a well that is used to supply potable water to a
residence or livestock, Enbridge will conduct pre and post dig well water testing if requested by the
landowner. If Enbridge’s well water test results demonstrate a substantial likelihood that Enbridge’s
integrity dig has rendered the well water unfit for human or animal consumption, as the case may be,
Enbridge will make reasonable efforts to provide an alternative source of water pending the completion
of appropriate remedial measures. However, none of the foregoing will constitute an admission of
liability by Enbridge.
126605/472266
MT DOCS 14420309                                   6
       Top Soil Stripping
      On cultivated lands, Enbridge will typically strip toil soil from the excavation area and the area
     where subsoil is stored. Enbridge will maintain a separation between the topsoil and the adjacent
      subsoil pile. This separation will be maintained throughout the course of the work in order to
      minimize the potential for mixing of subsoil and topsoil. Enbridge will also work with the
      landowner to determine the area stripped and the stripping depth.
     Wet Soils Shut Down
     Enbridge’s environmental management practices include a review of soil conditions prior to work
     commencing. If the Enbridge representative determines that planned activities will have an
     adverse effect on the soils, alternative activities will be conducted or other mitigating measures
     implemented in order to minimize and avoid any adverse effects on the soils. In an urgent or
     emergency situation where work is required under wet soil conditions, Enbridge will, make
     reasonable efforts to minimize impacts by restricting activity to the narrowest practicable area,
     utilize wide track or low ground pressure equipment, undertake full topsoil stripping if soil
     conditions permit and pump standing water to a vegetated area away from streams or ponds (or as
     agreed upon with the landowner).
     Weed Control
     Enbridge will work with the landowner and make reasonable efforts to ensure that weeds are
     controlled on any areas affected by integrity dig activities, including the identification and
     implementation of site specific mitigation measures to prevent the spread of weeds from areas of
     infestation to adjacent lands in accordance with Enbridge’s standard weed management measures
    and Enbridge’s Clubroot Biosecurity Agreement.
    PUBLIC SAFETY
Enbridge adheres to the regulations of the National Energy Board and the Canadian Occupational
Health and Safety Act for all maintenance and construction activities. Enbridge is committed to the
safety of the landowner, Enbridge’s employees and contractors, the public whom live near Enbridge’s
facilities and its pipelines. An Enbridge representative will monitor all excavation activity occurring
on the right-of-way to ensure its employees and contractors abide by all safety and environmental
requirements. Enbridge ensures that all unattended excavations are barricaded or fenced off. The type
of fencing depends on the level of risk associated with the excavation, considering such factors as the
location of the dig site, the degree of public access, the proximity of livestock and the length of time
the excavation is left unattended.
Please leave a message for the Enbridge Land Agent on our toll free line (1-800-668-2951) if you have
any questions or concerns while the work is being completed and we will return your call as soon as
possible.

                         ENBRIDGE PIPELINES CROP PERFORMANCE INVESTIGATIONS
   1. INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES
   Enbridge has consulted with AMEC Environment & Infrastructure (AMEC) representatives regarding
   landowner requests and has asked AMEC to design a sampling protocol on reclaimed Enbridge pipelines
   Rights-of-Ways (RoW). Upon completion of the sampling program, information will be evaluated to determine
   which factors are contributing to reduced crop performance and determine if soil properties were
   compromised due to the pipeline construction activities within the pipeline Right-of-Way (ROW).
   2. SAMPLING PROTOCOL FOR POST CONSTRUCTION CROP ASSESSMENTS
  The sampling plan to support crop performance will include two types of assessment to determine potential
   performance issues. The proposed assessments include investigation focusing on the following components:
       1) Soil assessment of physical and chemical properties; and
      2) Vegetation assessment of crop productivity.
  The primary focus of the sampling plan will be the determination of soil fertility and soil compaction as it
  directly relates to crop performance. This assessment will utilize off site controls against which the reclaimed
  lands will be directly compared.
  (a) PREPARATIONS AND LOGISTICS
 As part of completing the sampling, AMEC understands that any presence and activity of collecting
  information in the field on landowner property may lead to other concerns including safety, interference with
 critical operational practices, and/or concerns regarding the introduction of pests or weeds. As a result AMEC
 includes the following routine tasks that are completed for all field investigations, including detailed planning
 and logistics, following protocols with respect to safety and ground disturbance, minimizing crop production
 interruptions and disturbances, and the prevention of clubroot and weed spread with the implementation and
 adherence of a standardized weed and clubroot prevention and or sanitation protocol (where applicable).
 As well, a review of background information will be completed for each pipeline segment (assumed to be on
 quarter section basis) in particular, construction alignment sheets, regulatory applications and any available
                          —
 baseline soil information.
 (b) TIMING AND SEASON OF SAMPLING
 Crop maturation varies throughout the Prairie Provinces and is dependent on crop type (e.g., Alfalfa versus
Canola), and therefore ideal crop evaluation timing may need to be considered during the timing and planning
of the assessment. AMEC recommends soil and vegetation assessments to be completed at the same time,
which will occur following the completion of all reclamation activities, including completion of seeding. The
assessments will occur during the active growing season (ideally mid to late summer). Following pipeline
reclamation, the assessment of crop performance will be completed during the second growing season after
initial seeding. For example, if seeding of barley was completed in July, 2014, the sampling will occur
                                                                                                                 in

          (ii)         Sampling Locations
 Identification of which land segment of each quarter section is to be sampled will be based on Enbridge
                                                                                                                  crop

 stress areas, soil subsidence areas, or other visual indicators.

 It is proposed that within each quarter section, a systematic sampling approach will be established
 minimum of two transects per quarter section. Two sampling transects will be established        at approximate     400
 m intervals. Up to two additional transects locations may also be established in areas of observed poor crop
 performance or in locations showing landscape variability which may affect crop performance. Landscape

 variability is defined as distinct differences in soil moisture conditions (well drained to poorly drained);

 soil great group (Luvisol to Solonetzic); or significant topographic differences (upland to depression) within
 quarter section.
 A sampling transect will be aligned perpendicular to the pipeline with three different inspection locations
 established, including the reclaimed ditch, pipeline work space and a control location (Figure 1). At each
                                                                                                                      an
  inspection location various soil and vegetation parameters will be collected. The pipeline ROW consists of
  approximate 45 m wide footprint. Spacing for the inspection locations will include one inspection located
  within the pipeline ditch area (approximately 10 m from ROW boundary), a second location located within the
                                                                                                               located

            (iii)        Soil Description, On-Site Testing and Recording
  The soil quality assessment aspect of the field program will focus on the determination of soil fertility, soil
  chemistry, soil compaction rates, soil structure and admixing ratios. As discussed, the soil quality attributes
  will be collected under reclaimed conditions and compared directly to off-site control locations. This localized
  control method ensures direct site comparisons upon which recommendations can be developed.
  Soil Quality Data Collection
  At each inspection location, soils will be assessed and described by excavating a small soil pit (approx 30 x
  30 cm) with a spade followed by use of a hand auger, to obtain soil information up to a depth of 60 cm, with
  exception of the pipeline ditch. Due to pipeline integrity and safety concerns when working near the pipeline,
  soil on the pipeline ditch will be assessed only in the 0-30 cm range of the soil profile. Compaction ratings for
  the 30-60 cm range of the profile will be derived from the geotechnical investigations completed as part of the
  backfill activities and pipeline reclamation.
                                                     —••••
                                  Photo 1: Representation of soil profile assessment.
 This proposed soil inspection depth of 60 cm is based on the predominance of crop roots in the 30-60 cm of
 soil (as per Gan et al., 2011, and Alberta Agriculture and rural Development, 2013). In addition, research has
 shown that pipeline installations on Solonetzic soils in southern Alberta indicate compaction effects may reach
 depths of approximately 55 cm (Naeth et aI., 1987), while another three year study on replaced soils in north
 eastern Alberta (on Gray Luvisols) indicated that compaction only reached an approximate depth of 12-18 cm
 (Soon et al., 2000).
 This is also the zone in which any soil properties such as high bulk density (compaction) are most likely to
 affect the development of the crop root system.
The soil quality sampling will focus on soil compaction and fertility as the primary sources of soil limitations
with respect to crop production; however, AMEC recommends recording other on-site soil information at each
inspection location, to preclude any other causes of crop reductions.
The following topsoil parameters will be assessed at each inspection location: identification of topsoil
horizons, including topsoil depth (cm), % admixing, colour, texture, presence of lime, aggregate size (cm),
structure, aggregate strength (consistence), gravel/stone content, and identification of any other visual
compaction indicators including root restrictions, rooting structure, presence of mottling, or aeration
restrictions indicators.
Similar parameters will be assessed for the subsoil horizons, including colour, texture, presence of lime,
structure, aggregate strength (consistence), and also identification of any other visual compaction indicators
including root restrictions, rooting structure, presence of mottling, or aeration restriction indicators.
Soil Profile Restriction
A soil profile restriction evaluation will be completed by a qualitative (visual) compaction assessment and a
quantitative assessment by means of a penetrometer. The qualitative compaction assessment includes
evaluation of various components including the following:
     • rooting restriction patterns within the dominant rooting zones (0-60 cm)
     • soil consistence (friability of the soil),
     • soil aggregate size
                                                           3
      •   soil structure (platy or hard soil aggregates)
     •   recording of any mottling or gleyed soil colours (as an indicator of surface ponding or stratified
         moisture limitations)
All parameters will be recorded for the 0-15; 15-30 and 30-60 soil thickness ranges.
The quantitative approach of soil compaction at a site specific level is completed by the use of an agronomic
penetrometer. Within each soil inspection location, readings will be recorded through the upper soil profile
(e.g. topsoil, upper subsoil, lower subsoil layers). In general, the over-compaction of the reclaimed upper soil
horizons directly affects crop productivity by limiting rooting capability or water holding capacity. The
measurement of both reclaimed and off-site control conditions will provide an objective means for determining
project related differences.
Soil Sample Collection
In combination with the physical penetrometer tests, soil samples will be collected for laboratory analysis. A
soil sample will be taken at each sampling location on the proposed transects. Samples of approximately 1 kg
weight will be bagged and kept cool in transit and in storage facilities, until submitted to the identified
laboratory. Samples will be collected from both topsoil and subsoil horizons, with exception of the pipeline
ditch location where only topsoil samples will be collected. As a result a total of 3 topsoil samples and 2
subsoil samples will be collected per transect and submitted for laboratory analysis. To ensure representative
sampling, topsoil composite samples will be composed of at least three sub-samples taken from within a three
 metre radius of the main sampling location. Subsoil samples will be taken from a single inspection location.
 Soil analysis parameters are discussed below.
 Photographs will be collected at each transect location, to capture and identify any landscape or soil profile
 problems or to aid further clarification or confirmation.
          (iv)         Laboratory Analyses of Soil Samples
 In support of the collected soil samples, AMEC suggests at minimum the following laboratory analyses: pH,
 electrical conductivity (EC); and, sodium adsorption ratio (SAR). These analyses are applied in assessing
 salinity, which is a factor in crop performance. To ensure variability of nutrient availability is evaluated as well,
 nutrient analyses will also be completed including assessment of nutrient nitrogen, phosphorous, sulphur and
 potassium (collectively referred to as NPKS).
 (d) FIELD PROGRAM: VEGETATION AND CROP QUALITY ASSESSMENT
          (i)          Vegetation Assessments
 All vegetation assessments will be completed at the same soil sampling locations and frequencies as previous
 described under Section 2.3. The types of vegetation data collected for a crop depends on the type of crop
 present at each transect location. Crop assessments should be completed during the active growing season
 and ideally during the early crop maturing stages (early seed development stage) as per Government of
 Alberta (2011), 2010 Reclamation Criteria for Weilsites and Associated Facilities for Cultivated Lands.
  Common parameters are plant density, height, and head length in grain crops. In pasture and forage fields,
  plant density, cover and height of stand can also be assessed. Overall health assessment should also be
  noted, as many factors can result in plant stress (e.g., weather, pests, weeds or diseases).
  Frequency of crop assessment inspection locations will follow the same intensity as the soil assessments,
  including placement of control sampling locations. If significant differences between control and RoW results
  are observed, this could trigger another soil assessment or additional soil sampling locations, to either further
  delineate the problem or to determine if compaction, fertility or another issue is potentially an underlying
  cause of diminished crop performance within a RoW.
  Photographs will be collected at each transect location, to capture and identify any vegetation problems or to
  aid further clarification or confirmation.
                                                           4
  3. RESULTS ANALYSIS AND REPORTING
 (a) ANALYSIS OF FIELD AND LABORATORY DATA
 For compaction, admixing and other parameters, as discussed above, basic statistics will be calculated on a
 quarter section basis. These include average, range and, as applicable, the frequency of an observation; e.g.,
 compaction observed in 2 of 6 sample points in a quarter section. This will enable characterizing potential
 issues as being present throughout a land parcel, or only in a portion of it. This would also possibly enable
 recommendations for potential mitigation measures on a site-specific basis.
 Once fertility parameters have been analysed, crop fertilizer recommendations will be requested of the
 laboratory carrying out the analyses for NPKS. Laboratories maintain databases and software that enable
 fertilizer recommendations based on crop type, soil type and climatic subregion within the Alberta prairies.
 Other analytical parameters will be examined by an AMEC soil scientist for identification of features that may
 limit soil productivity and crop performance. These generally consist of salinity level, sodicity level, pH and
 texture (particle size distribution).
All parameters as collected from the RoW will be compared with the same parameters as collected from the
 control inspection locations.
(b) REPORTING OF FIELD AND LABORATORY FINDINGS
All field data will be summarized and upon review of the soil and crop information, will include
recommendations for addressing localized problems on the RoW. This will be presented in a standardized
report format.
The soil report will include a sketch of the quarter section under consideration, with locations of land
segments, transects and sample points indicated; sketches will not be to scale, but locations of specific
features will be indicated by GPS coordinates and/or distance of specific site features from the quarter section
line or other reference point feature. The soil report will also include summaries of statistical analysis (as per
above), fertilizer recommendations (as per laboratory generated report), and additional comments to
summarize the type and extent of the issues observed on-site, and if any, recommendations to address
various reclamation soil issues. The crop report will be similar to the soil report, including summarizing field
data, but with the exception that crop assessments will not have associated laboratory data. Relevant
photographs to illustrate significant soil or vegetation problems will also be included.
The reports would be submitted to Enbridge, for review and discussion of the appropriate mitigation actions
with the landowner. The report components may be several pages long, particularly with inclusion of lab
reports, which can be lengthy. Therefore, front page presentation of key findings and recommendations will
be provided in a summary format.

Please be advised that the Municipality of Pembina would like to take this time to say that we are pleased to
be a commenter on the Enbridge Pipeline Line 3 replacement project.
The Municipality of Pembina supports the need of the project. Infrastructure renewal is very important and
well as the safe transportation of the product. We have an interest in the safe operation of the Line 3
pipeline and will benefit from the reduced impact associated with any additional integrity digs along the Line
3 pipeline route. With the Line 3 Replacement Program; these items will be addressed and held in the
highest standards that is required.
The Line 3 Replacement Project will help create an economic spin off for all those that are directly affected
by the project. This means jobs will be created and maintained; and with the commitment to safety that
Enbridge insists upon, it keeps local companies in compliance with high safety standards that they carry on to
other aspects. More jobs in the community means a boost in not only the local economy but at the
provincial and federal level as well. I also have to mention that Enbridge has been amazing to our local
community clubs and other volunteer organizations. Through grants that they have given to our local clubs
and charities, many things which needed to be replaced were able to be; an example was for one of our local
Fire Departments and the ability to buy some new turn-out gear for its members.
With approximately 8.5 miles of pipeline located within the municipality, we have had a very good working
relationship with Enbridge from the beginning. Enbridge has provided information in relation to the Line 3
Replacement Program and has addressed any issues or concerns that the Municipality has in relation to this
project from the outset. With the way information is freely offered and questions gladly answered, along

Enbridge Pipelines Inc.
Line 3 Replacement
September 15, 2015
The Regina & District Chamber of Commerce represents over 1200 members from a wide range of business
classifications. The proposed Line 3 Replacement could have a significant impact on a number of our
members most notably in the skilled trades as well as the service industry. Given the largest section of the
proposed line replacement is in southern Saskatchewan we are of the view that it will have a positive impact
on our local economy. Should the project proceed we will work with Enbridge and our
members to connect both parties.
The Regina & District Chamber of Commerce is firmly of the view that as Canadians we must do our utmost
to ensure that our infrastructure meets the needs of not only today but also tomorrow. Renewing the
infrastructure in question will go a long way toward addressing the future safety of the line as well as
environmental concerns particularly given we are talking about replacing an existing pipeline.
The movement of energy resources is vital to the Canadian economy, particularly from a western Canadian
perspective. The pipeline will support the Canadian energy sector will into the future and will help the

 country in its quest to be energy self sufficient. The project if approved would also allow major pipe
manufacturers like EVRAZ in Regina to bid on a major project which would help sustain and grow a major
Regina employer.
പ
Renewing the pipeline will also help to ensure that Canada's energy supply is moved in the most
environment friendly and efficient manner. Moreover the construction and maintenance of the line will
create jobs along the line which in all likelihood will include First Nations and Metis people as well as other
under representative people. In my other capacity as the Chair of the Regina Trades and Skills Centre we
would be prepared to help with some of this objective if requested.

                       Thank you in adv nee for accepting this Letter of Comment on Enbridge's proposed
                       Une 3 Replaceme t Program. I write to you in my capacity as the duly elected Member
                       of the Saskatche an Legislative Assembly for the Constituency of Moosomin. I have
                       represented this onstituency since 1986, and in that time my interaction with the folks
                       from Enbridge .is haracterized as both professional and responsible.
                       En bridge's existin Line 3 enters the Moosomin constituency from the west near the
                       community of Ke dal and exits through the east by Fairlight. The replacement line will
                       follow almost exa tly the same pathway.
                       over the past yea , both myself and the communities within Moosomin have had
                       numerous apport nities-through En bridge's "coffee talks,, and government briefings
                       initiated by Enbri ge's public affairs team, to name a few- to consult with Enbridge on
                       this project. The encounters have been productive and informative f or my
                       constituents and . Enbridge has also undertaken extensive consultations with local First
                       Nations, including Carry the Kettle First Nation, Cowessess First Nation, Kahkewistahaw
                       First Nation, Ocha owace First Nation, Sakimay First Nation, File Hills Qu,Appelle Tribal

                       Saskatchewan Me is Economic Development Sectors of Eastern Region IIa and I II.
                       As a public serva , I support projects that improve public safety and benefit our local
                       and provincial eco omies. The Line 3 Replacement program meets those two
                       requirements. Fir , I understand that this project will, as the name suggests, replace
                       an old pipeline wi h new pipes using the most advanced materials and technology
                       currently on the arket. I also look forward to the advances in monitoring and spill
                       prevention that E bridge will bring to this replacement project.

         municipalities in  014.

'3‘ I SASKATCHEWAN
CHAMBER 9/ COMMERCE
October 6, 2015
Mr. PeterWatson, Chair
National Energy Board
517 Tenth Avenue SW
Calgary, Alberta T2R 0A8
Dear Mr. Watson:
The Saskatchewan Chamber of Commerce (SCC) is a business advocacy organization
that represents the interests of over 10,000 businesses and other organizations within
the province of Saskatchewan. In addition to provincial and federal lobbying and
advocacy activities, the SCC also conducts its own research in a wide variety of areas
to inform its opinions on what the government and private sector should be doing to
help make Saskatchewan a great place to live, work, and invest.
As a landlocked province that requires a wide variety of infrastructure options (pipelines,
rail, trucking) to export its natural resource products to world markets, the
Saskatchewan Chamber of Commerce (SCC) supports the Line 3 Replacement
Program because it will improve Saskatchewan's ability to transport and sell oil into
, those markets. By increasing pipeline capacity, there will also be a reduction in the .
amount of oil being transported by rail, which will alleviate some of the rail capacity
issues that were constraining the export of grain, potash, and manufactured goods.
Saskatchewan and its neighboring western provinces have a significant amount of their
respective economic growth that is dependent on having a thriving energy industry that
is able to effectively transport and sell its products to world markets. Whether it is the
creation and growth of primary oil production companies or the multitude of tertiary
service companies that support the primary production, having an energy industry that
is growing is in the best interest of all those businesses, plus it supports the social
programs that governments pay for with oil-related tax revenues. It is critical that this
piece of pipeline infrastructure is renewed in order to support that ongoing energy sector
growth by helping to reduce transportation restraints. The actual process of the pipeline
renewal itself will also create numerous immediate opportunities for companies
(equipment suppliers and construction companies) to participate in the building of the
pipeline, as well as support the workers as they build it (hotels, restaurants).
In order to transport oil in a way that ensures continuing safety for the public, as well as
the prevention of any unnecessary environmental damage, infrastructure that is used to
transport oil must be periodically renewed. Whether pipelines or rail lines, infrastructure
must be replaced and/or refreshed in order to make sure it is continuing to meet the

safety needs of the public and the capacity needs of the businesses that use it. This I
renewed pipeline will fulfill both of those requirements. Also, by Enbridge actively l
encouraging local businesses to participate in the construction of the pipeline, there will f
be an opportunity to create immediate jobs and also expand the local expertise of i
Saskatchewan‘s businesses with these kinds of projects so they will have a greater }
ability to participate in future projects. g
The Saskatchewan Chamber of Commerce fully supports the Line 3 Replacement }
Program and we recommend that the National Energy Board grant Enbridge the
necessary approvals to move forward with this project as soon as possible. I
Sincerely, i

Attention: Sherri Young
Dear Madam:
Re: Enbridge Line 3 Reptacement Program Late Application to Participate
NEB Hearing 0H-002-2015
Please be advised that we are counsel for Onion Lake Cree Nation (“Onion Lake") in the above- ‘
referenced matter- Please acCept the enclosed Late Application to Participate in the Enbridge
Line 3 Replacement ProgramiNationa’l Energy Board Hearing.
Onion Lake missed the deadline for applying to participate in this matter due to inadvenence ‘
_ and a tack of capacity at the Nation. When Onion Lake was first notified of the deadline for
applying to participate in the Hearing, it was in the midst of a 'comptex tegal appticatlon wnth
Canada regarding the transfer of c-apita! monies held by Canada to an independent trust for .the
benefit of Onion Lake. Onion Lake had been lobbying Canada for the transfer since at teast ,
2009. which ultimately culminated in a Court action in 2014. Finally, on March 9, 2016, Canada
agreed in principle to transfer the monies into trust, which was a major development, but which“
demanded countless hours of staff time and the compiete dedication of Chief and Ceuncul. From
March until July,- when a referendum was heard, staff time was consumed by thzs histortc protect
and all financial reso'Urces- were funneled into the same. Staff weretold to stop utilizing
consulting services and to limit program spending. The deadline for applying to participate in the
Project was on March 31, 2015, when Onion Lake was futiy engaged in referendum
preparations.
. 1
As soon as Onion Lake had greater capacity in July 2015. it immediately began work to study
the Project area to determine whether any concerns were significant enough to justify applying
to participate in the Hearing. This required a field visit to the project area within Onion Lake's
Traditional Territory. Onion Lake‘s Lands Department staff had to get special training to do the
visit. It was also very difficult to coordinate the visit amongst the staff and elders who wished to
attend. given that this was occurring during the very busy summer months when many land

         Re: Enbridge Pipelines Inc. - Line 3 Replacement Program
               Letter of Comment
In March 2015, Minnewasta Golf & Country Club (MGCC), Morden, MB
submitted an Application to Participate as a Commenter on the proposed
Enbridge Pipelines Line 3 Replacement Program.
Our submission was based on the Commercial impacts of the project.
Our understanding of the project is that the existing Line 3 will be
decommissioned and replaced by a new line in a different location.
MGCC heartily endorses this proposal as it would have a significant economic
impact on the operation of MGCC.
The existing Line 3 crosses 4 fairways of MGCC.
If there is a needed repair of this line, the impact could vary from a minor
inconvenience of golfers negotiating around a small dig site or limiting their play,
to a complete shutdown of the Front 9 holes of the golf course.
Either of these options negatively changes the Minnewasta golf experience for
guests and members.
We are a destination course and golfers and banquet/restaurant patrons
expect the facility and course to be what it is, not a construction site. We still
have potential visitors asking questions regarding our playability after a 2007
pipeline installation.
A major repair to the existing Line #3 could potentially result in a 60% loss of
operating revenue for golf and a similar reduction for our restaurant and banquet
facility.
Since the initial Application to Participate, we have worked with Enbridge on
another project which impacted the golf course. It was a very positive experience
and indicative of the relationship that Enbridge has tried to foster with its
impacted community and stakeholders. Enbridge worked hard to ensure that
their communications were current and ongoing and that all the stakeholders
concerns were discussed and addressed.
 Even though MGCC has positive and healthy relationship with Enbridge Pipeline
Inc., we support the decommissioning of the existing Line 3 and re-routing a new
Line outside of Minnewasta Golf & Country Club property.

Attention: Sheri Young
Dear Madam:
RE: Health Canada Letter of Comment: Line 3 Replacement Program (OH-004-2014)
As a registered Commenter, Health Canada (HC) respectfully submits this Letter of
Comment to the National Energy Board (NEB) on the proposed Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line
3 Replacement Program (the Project) for consideration.
HC is the federal department responsible for helping Canadians maintain and improve their
health. HC participates in the environmental assessment (EA) process is as a Federal
Authority, as per Section 20 of the Canadian Environmental AssessmentAct 2012 (the Act).
Accordingly, HC provides expertise in its possession with respect to the potential impacts
of the proposed project on human health, speciﬁcally in the areas of air quality, drinking
and recreational water quality, noise, contamination of country foods, and human health
risk assessment (HHRA). Consistent with subsection 5(1) (c) of CEAA 2012, HC focused its
review on impacts of the Project on the health of Aboriginal peoples, and paid special
attention to health concerns raised by Aboriginal peoples during the environmental
assessment process.
HC reviewed the information submitted to the NEB on the potential impacts to human
health from this Project. The documents reviewed include the Proponent's Application,
HHRA of pipeline releases, information requests and responses up until October 16, 2015.
HC notes three key areas of concern with regards to the application. There are several
deficiencies in the air quality assessment, exclusion of country foods and lack of
consideration for Aboriginal peoples in the HHRA for potential spills.
Please note that throughout this Letter of Comment, references to the Proponent’s and
intervenors’ documents do not constitute an endorsement of these documents in part or
entirety. These references only indicate that HC has reviewed and considered these
documents in preparation of HC’s Letter of Comment.
Please find below HC’s detailed comments. HC appreciates the opportunity to offer these
comments for the consideration of the NEB.

1 Executive Summary

Health Canada (HC) is the federal department responsible for helping Canadians maintain
and improve their health. The key objective of HC’s environmental assessment (EA)
program is to prevent, reduce and mitigate the potential effects of any change to the
environment (such as exposure to contaminants through air, water or country foods on the
health of Aboriginal peoples). As a federal authority under CEAA 2012 (Section 20), HC’s
primary role is to make available specialist or expert information and knowledge in its
possession in the areas of air quality, country foods, drinking and recreational water
quality, noise and HHRA. Consistent with subsection 5(1) (c) of CEAA 2012, HC focused its
review on impacts of the Project on the health of Aboriginal peoples.

HC reviewed key documents provided by the Proponent and intervenors submitted to the
N EB up until October 16, 2015 including the screening level human health risk assessment
of pipeline releasesl, environment and socio-economic assessments”, air quality
assessments”, as well as other relevant and supplementary information such as
Proponent’s responses to information requests. These documents were reviewed for HC’s
areas of expertise, including air quality, drinking and recreational water quality, HHRA,
noise and country foods.

The information provided by Enbridge Pipelines Inc. suggests that, overall, there is low .
likelihood for acute and chronic health effects due to project-related air emissions.
However, several deficiencies were identified by HG in the air quality assessment which
reduces the level of confidence in the predicted concentrations of airborne chemicals of
potential concern (COPC). These deficiencies include an inadequate COPC list, lack of
information on sensitive receptors and a lack of air quality dispersion modelling for the
construction and decommissioning scenarios.

Country foods are major components of the Aboriginal traditional subsistence lifestyle. The
effects of country foods on human health were not assessed by the Proponent for the
proposed Project. It is important to consider potential impacts of a spill on the
contamination of, access to, availability of, terrestrial country foods consumed by local
Aboriginal communities.

Furthermore, a major spill of crude oil (characterized as a high consequence, low
probability event) in the terrestrial environment, could have substantial effects on drinking
water sources. It is therefore important that High Consequence Areas (HCA) be identified

that take into account the values of Aboriginal peoples regarding the use of these areas, e.g.
as sources of drinking water, and use for cultural and spiritual purposes and that
appropriate priorities be given to these areas in spill response plans.
2 Air Quality Assessment
HC notes that not all possible COPCs in air emissions as a result of project activities were
identified in the air quality assessments5i6. According to the 2014 National Pollutant
Release Inventory (NPRI) data for the Hardisty Terminal (NPRl 6910)6, on-site releases to
air included total particulate matter (TPM), VOCs and n-hexane. Thus, additional COPCs
should be included in the air quality assessment, including Criteria Air Contaminants
(PM2.5, TPM, ozone and VOCs in addition to benzene), petroleum hydrocarbon fractions, n-
hexane, PAHs and sulphur-containing compounds (including sulphur dioxide and sulphuric
acid). The exclusion of these additional COPCs in the air quality assessment could lead to an
underestimation of risk for human health. Haul roads around pumping stations could also
be a substantial source of road dust. It is HC’s opinion that it would be crucial for the
Proponent to include these additional COPCs or explicitly state the reasons for excluding
them from the analysis.
As indicated in the application, the Line 3 replacement pipeline will be carrying a range of
light to heavy crude oils. In the Ecological and Human Health Risk Assessment (EHHRA) of
Pipeline Releases7, two crude oil types were modelled: Federated Crude (FC) and Cold Lake
Winter Blend (CLWB). Thus, assuming that the three new storage tanks at the Hardisty
Terminal could store these two oil products, HC notes that both crude oils were not

' assessed in the air quality assessment, but rather only Cold Lake (CL) product was
considered. Since F C and CLWB have different chemical compositions and physical-
chemical properties than CL, each should be assessed in the air quality assessment. FC
contains a higher proportion of lighter hydrocarbon constituents (e.g. benzene, toluene,
ethylbenzene and xylene) which would result in higher vapour emissions from the surface
of the oil in comparison to CLWB with a lower proportion of volatile constituentsB.
HC notes that there was no quantitative air dispersion modelling that was conducted for
the construction or decommissioning phase of the project. It would be expected that
emissions profiles between the construction and operation phases would be sufﬁciently
different to warrant a separate assessment for both phases. During construction, there may
be more vehicle activity and therefore more particulate matter and dust in the vicinity of
the project which could reach levels that are associated with potential human health risks.
F urthermore, there is also no information provided on heavy equipment operation during
the construction phase which may add to air emissions. Thus, HC suggests that the

Proponent provide an explanation as to why this activity was excluded from the short-term
construction phase of Line 3 decommissioning/replacement.

In Section 5.3.1 Sensitive Receptors6, there is no definition of the term sensitive receptors,
nor were they identified for the construction and decommissioning phases of the Line 3
pipeline. To ensure that the potential risk to sensitive receptors (including Aboriginal
receptors) is not underestimated, HC recommends providing the following additional
information:

0 Characterization of potential human receptors (i.e., closest residences, aboriginal
residents/traditional resource users, recreational users etc.) and rationale for
sensitive receptors chosen,

0 Distance of receptors (including nearest Aboriginal receptors) to the Hardisty
Terminal Complex,

0 A map showing the baseline and estimated COPC concentrations and the location of
human receptors,

0 Information on site access to help characterize the suitability of recreational users
as sensitive receptors.

HC also notes the addition of 18 new pumping stations which may add to air emissions.
Additional information on fugitive emissions from these pumping stations is
recommended, as well as providing a quantitative assessment of air emissions emitted
from these stations from burning fuel to drive compressors and oil pump engines.
2.1 Mitigation of Health Effects of Air Pollutants
It is HC’s view that any underestimations or uncertainties with respect to the
concentrations of air pollutants resulted in a considerable degree of uncertainty in the
predicted health risks. Therefore, HC supports the use of monitoring and mitigation
measures to control and minimize the Project’s contribution to airborne emissions.
HC strongly encourages that risk management measures not be confined to meeting the
standards, but should also be targeted towards reducing population exposure to the extent
technically and economically feasible. The Canadian Council of Ministers of the
Environment publication ”Guidance Document on Continuous Improvement and Keeping-
CIean-Areas-Clean") provides information and guidance that would assist the Proponent in
aligning mitigation measures with those goals.
3 Human Health Risk Assessment for Drinking and Recreational Water Quality
While the Proponent did not assess the effects of the proposed Project on drinking and
recreational water quality on human health, during normal operations, there appears to be
a low likelihood of impacts on drinking water quality in the Vicinity of Aboriginal
communities. Local F irst Nation communities (e.g. Whitecap Dakota First Nation in
9 Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment. Guidance document on Continuous Improvement and Keeping-Clean-
Areas-Clean. Canada-wide Standards for Particulate Matter and Ozone. 2007.

Page 5 of 8

Saskatchewan, and the Canupakwa Dakota First Nation and Swan Lake First Nation in
Manitoba) obtain their drinking water from groundwater.

The proponent indicated in their assessment of HCAs that releases of crude oil near Oak
Lake or the South Saskatchewan River could potentially affect drinking water supplies“).
HC recommends that all project related changes to water quality, including spills are
identified and quantified.

HC noted that in the Socio-Economic Assessment“, the Town of Manitou expressed
concerns about the potential for oil spill during construction or operation that may
contaminate the Mary Jane Reservoir, a popular site for recreational activities (e.g. boating,
swimming, and ﬁshing). Thus, should there be an accidental pipeline spill to the Mary Jane
Reservoir, recreational water quality may be affected. These impacts were not assessed by
the Proponent. HC therefore recommends that the Proponent have in place a strategy for
communicating with the appropriate authorities in the event of a spill or release into Mary
Jane Reservoir (and other waterways) to minimize or prevent exposure.

4 Human Health Risk Assessment of Pipeline Spills into the Aquatic Environment

HC notes that the EHHRA establishes that both types of transported crude oil contain
several PAHs like benz[a]anthracene, benzo[b]ﬂuoranthene, and dibenz[a,h]anthracene as
well as other potentially carcinogenic PAHsll. HC recommends that a rationale be provided
for excluding these chemicals from the HHRA as COPCs given their potential health risks.
4.1 Consequences of Spills in the Vicinity of First Nations Lands

An assessment of HCAs for each site indicated that in the event of a release,
environmentally sensitive areas, drinking water intakes, aboriginal lands, and other
populated areas may be at risk of potentially significant adverse environmental effects“.
Four locations were selected as representative locations for hypothetical spill scenarios,
and were assessed with a HCA for hypothetical hydrocarbon releases (modelled release is
unmitigated for 24 hours), the South Saskatchewan River, Qu’Appelle River, Souris River,
and Oak Lake.

The EHHRA did not recognize the boundaries and traditional use of Aboriginal traditional
territories and thus, the impacts of pipeline spills on Aboriginal peoples may be
underestimated. HC advises that without criteria which include traditional use of an area
by Aboriginal peoples, the consequence scores assigned by the proponent to HCAs may
lead to inadequate response measures being developed for impacts on Aboriginal peoples
and their traditional activities.

10 Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Ecological and Human Health Risk Assessment ofPipeIine Releases. August 2015. (A4SZJ6,
A4SZI7, A4SZI8).

Page 6 of 8

HC suggests that information to describe the spill scenarios (e.g. location, duration) and
pathways through which a product in the pipeline could enter either a surface water or
groundwater source used by Aboriginal groups for drinking, cultural, spiritual, traditional
and / or agricultural purposes, be taken into account for designation of water sources in a
HCA and in assigning consequence factors.

4.2 Mitigation of Human Health Eﬁects Due to Spills

The Proponent has documented its commitment to developing spill prevention, spill
contingency and emergency response plans in the Application and its responses to
information requests from intervenors11 in the next emergency response procedure
update (scheduled for Q4 2015) for operating pipelines .

HC notes that there is no information to confirm that there would be air monitoring to
measure HzS concentrations for all phases of the project. The HHRA is restricted to only
ambient air monitoring for VOCs following a crude oil spill. Aside from measures taken to
reduce exposures such as evacuation, restricted access and physical clean-up of areas
affected by crude oil residues, in conjunction with ambient air monitoring, surface water
monitoring and public advisories to limit certain activities (e.g. fishing and swimming), no
other mitigation measures have been described in the HHRA.

For any emergency event, HC considers the protection of human health as a primary
consideration in the development of emergency preparedness and response plans. This
includes monitoring for human health impacts and the provision of health related guidance.
For the mitigation measures to be developed (including spill contingency and emergency
response plans), HC offers the following considerations to protect human health:

0 Consider measures that can be implemented quickly and effectively to limit human
exposure both in the short term immediately following a spill incident and in the
long term such that risks to human health are minimized;

0 Consider the possible lag times for contaminants to appear in country foods and
other environmental media when developing chemical monitoring plans; and

0 Consider identifying the proximity of human receptors (permanent or seasonal
residents) to the pipeline right-of—way as a key criterion for determining response
times and actions.

HC also suggests that as part of evaluating the human health impacts of a spill event on
drinking water, attention is given to the capability of drinking water treatment facilities in
the affected area to be able to handle the chemical loads due to a spill event and continue to
meet drinking water guidelines for protection of human health.

5 Human Health Risk Assessment for Contamination of Country Foods12
The effects of country foods on human health was not assessed by the Proponent for the
proposed Project on country foods on human health, accordingly HC is unable to comment.
HC is of the view that contamination of species which are traditionally harvested would
likely cause adverse effects on the community, should a spill occur. HC suggests that when
Aboriginal populations provide information about their consumption of country foods this
should be incorporated in a HHRA to minimize the uncertainties around exposure to
COPCs.
6 Human Health Risk Assessment for Noise
With respect to noise, the Application reports that there are instances where permissible
sound levels (PSLS) are expected to be exceeded during the operational phase at the
Kerrobert, Glenavon, Glenboro, and Gretna Stations, with projected cumulative daytime
operational PSLs predicted to be exceeded by 1.3, 1.1, 0.8, and 0.5 dBA13. In situations
where exceedances are estimated to occur and noise reductions via mitigation measures
are anticipated, HC suggests that the effectiveness of mitigation measures be verified by
follow-up monitoring to ensure noise levels will meet applicable PSLs.
12 HC deﬁnes country foods, within the environmental assessment context, as comprising of all those foodstuffs which are
obtained outside of the commercial supply chain, including those harvested by hunting, trapping, fishing or small-scale
farming, and produce grown in vegetable gardens and orchards or collected from naturally occurring sources (e.g. wild
berries).

Dear Sir or Madam:
Re:    Line 3 Replacement Program, Enbridge Pipelines Inc.
The Saskatchewan Industrial & Mining Suppliers Association (SIMSA) represents
the interests of Saskatchewan industrial manufacturers, equipment and service
suppliers to increase their market share of industrial and resource projects, in
particular those taking place in Saskatchewan. Its approximately 80 members
have several $Billion in annual revenues, several thousand employees and tens
of $Millions of annual reinvestment in this province. SIMSA notes that the
longest section of the Line 3 Replacement route is in Saskatchewan and hopes
to work with Enbridge and its contractors to help local industrial suppliers
access the project work. SIMSA supports the Line 3 Replacement Program and
the related activities of Enbridge Pipelines Inc.
SIMSA supports infrastructure renewal, transportation and export of energy,
and safety advances as part of sustainably growing Canada’s economy. Any
infrastructure needs renewal or replacement to maintain safety, reliability and
operational effectiveness. Using pipelines is by far the safest and most
effective means of transporting hydrocarbons.
Energy supply is vital to Canada’s economy and a significant aspect of the
economy of western Canada from exploration through to development,
transportation and consumption. This pipeline will support development of
Canadian energy into the future. It is also an opportunity for Saskatchewan
industrial suppliers to participate in this mega-project, take advantage of an
economic development opportunity, and continue to diversify the province’s
	
                                        1	
  
 economy. The experience from participating in the Line 3 Replacement
Program will also support the ability of local companies to compete in the
global supply chain for pipeline and other petroleum industry projects.
Renewing the pipeline and its related safety and other infrastructure will help
continue the safe transportation of oil and increase the protection of the
environment along its existing route. Enbridge has been transparent in its
project planning and responsive to enquiries. SIMSA would like Enbridge to
maximize the opportunities for Saskatchewan companies to bid on and supply
to appropriate aspects of the project through ongoing information exchange,
procurement meetings, access to prime contractors, local procurement
policies, etc. There is significant potential for local industrial suppliers,
including SIMSA member companies, many of which are Aboriginal-owned, to
benefit from contracting to and supplying this project. In addition to business
development, there are opportunities for related employment, training and
other socio-economic benefits.
I would be please to provide further information and comments if necessary.
Best regards,
Alun Richards

To whom it may concern,
The Rural Municipality of Lorne Council would like to express our support regarding the Enbridge Line 3 Replacement
Program.
As previously expressed Enbridge has been diligent in keeping Council up to date with the progress of the Line 3 project.
There have been several consultation opportunities allowing Council to bring forth questions from local ratepayers.
Council is aware ofthe need for the replacement and how this is going to affect the local citizens. The Rural Municipality
is a large agricultural area with much of the pipeline crossing agricultural land. Council as well as land owners have been
able to speak to Enbridge one on one and have been able to resolve many concerns.
Council along with many of the urban areas Lorne encompasses are awaiting the economic benefits this project will
bring to the Municipality. Enbridge’s commitment to use local employment and businesses is encouraging. The
Municipality has numerous suppliers and services within our area. Everything from portable toilets to accommodations
is covered.
The Rural Municipality is anxiously waiting for the construction to being.

Shannon Gaultier, CMMA
Chief Administrative Officer

Dear Sir/Madam,
Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters (CME) is pleased to write this letter in support of
Enbridge’s Line 3 Replacement Program.
We are Canada’s largest trade and industry association, and the voice of manufacturing and
global business in Canada. Collectively, CME’s membership network accounts for an estimated
82 per cent of Canadian manufacturing output and 90 per cent of all goods and services
exported.
Our support for this initiative is based on three important benefits we believe the Line 3
Replacement program will produce for Canada. The first of these is the economic spinoffs and
supply chain opportunities that the proposed investment would generate. Through increased
demand for steel and other products, this project will create additional manufacturing activity,
employment and other business opportunities across Canada. For example, nearly all of the
pipe being used in the proposed $7.5 billion Line 3 Replacement will be coming from EVRAZ.
EVRAZ is a member of CME and is a leader in steel manufacturing.
The second benefit is that the Line 3 Replacement Program will improve market access for
Canada's energy products. Pipeline capacity is strained, owing in part to the surge in output
from the Bakken and other shale oil plays. While low oil prices have postponed new
investments that would even further strain our existing capacity, prices will not remain low
forever.
Additional pipeline capacity is critical to ensuring that our energy sector recovers and continues
to grow. The economic spinoff effects of capital investment in energy are considerable. They
extend across the country. Projects such as this one are an important step towards ensuring
that we continue to realize the economic benefits of our natural resources.
Finally, CME supports infrastructure renewal and improved transportation safety as important
not only to the Canadian economy, but to the health and well-being of all Canadians. The Line 3
Replacement program will result in a larger and safer pipeline than the one currently in place.
Moreover, it will reduce the need to transport oil by rail. In the absence of sufficient pipeline
capacity, oil-by-rail has surged. This is not only a less safe way to ship energy, but it also strains
 the capacity of our rail infrastructure. This affects rail’s capacity to provide transportation
services to other vital sectors of the Canadian economy, notably agriculture and manufacturing.
In summary, Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters strongly supports the Line 3 Replacement
Program. It yields significant benefits for Canadian manufacturers; promotes growth in the
energy sector leading to even more economic spinoff effects; and contributes to a safer and
more efficient national transportation system.

Re: Enbridge Line 3 Replacement Program - Letter of Comment

NEB Hearing OH-OOZ-ZOIS

Onion Lake C ree Nation ("Onion Lake“) is a C rec peOple, a band within the meaning of the
Indian Act, a signatory to Treaty No. 6 and an aboriginal people within the meaning of the
Constitution Act. 1982. Onion Lake is a large community and has over 5,000 members. It is
located 40 km north of Lloydminster. Alberta with reserve lands within the Treaty No. 6
Territory on both sides ofthe Alberta/Saskatchewan border.

As a signatory to Treaty No. 6. Onion Lake has treaty and aboriginal rights to hunt, ﬁsh and trap
for food; gather medicines, plants and berries; and engage in cultural and spiritual practices on
the land. Onion Lake also has the inherent right to self-govemment which includes the right to
manage its resources and lands.

Onion Lake’s Traditional Territory covers parts of Eastern Alberta and Western Saskatchewan,
stretching west past Hardisty, Alberta and east past Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. It overlaps with
the Enbridge Line 3 Replacement Project (the °‘Project”) in both pt‘t‘winces.l

The Project right-of-way passes less than 20 km north of Sounding Lake, Alberta. Multiple
generations ofcldcrs have noted the sacredness of‘ the lake and the surrounding area. The area is
used for hunting and is tiequently used for ceremonial purposes. Elders recently held a pipe
ceremony at Sounding Lake in honour of the recent passing of an Elder who regularly brought
members to the area to pass on indigenous lmowledge about the site. There are many stories
about Sounding Lake, including the story ot‘a Spiritual Thunderbird.

' Onion Lake's Traditional Territory boundaries are not ﬁxed and may ex olvc as more information is gathered from
elders.

Onion Lake is concerned that the Project Will have impacts on Sounding Lake, including impacts
caused by noise, increased trafﬁc, presence of workers, increased access to the area and
increased competition for hunting and gathering. These are direct and adverse impacts which will
disrupt the tranquility and sacredness of the area as well as members’ ability to hunt and gather
effectively.
Onion Lake is also concerned about impacts to ButTalo Sage, a traditional medicine which was '
discovered along the pipeline ﬁght—of—way during a recent site visit of the Project area.
Onion Lake is also concerned about the potential for spills from the Project. Environmental
disasters in and near our T raditional Territory render it unﬁt for traditional use. Speciﬁcally:
- Impacts to wildlife habitat and populations - When animal pepulations are killed or
become diseased from oil and other toxins, our members’ ability to hunt is compromised.
Our members will not hunt or carry on traditional practices in an area that has been
contaminated. Even if the area is cleaned, there are lingering effects that render the land
unsuitable for our purposes.
0 Impacts to ﬁsh habitat, ﬁsh populations and water quality — Oil spills have the potential
to impact ﬁsh habitat and populations along With all water in the vicinity of the Proj eot.
Many of our members ﬁsh and drink water right off the land. Members cannot ﬁsh or
drink from the streams if they have been contaminated with oil.
Onion Lake respectfully requests that these concerns be accounted for during the NEB’s
- consideration of the Proj ect.
Yours tmly,
Onion Lake Cree Natl on

  Dear Madam:
 RE:      Enbridge Pipelines Inc.(Enbridge) — Line 3 Replacement Program
 Please find accept for filing the enclosed Letter of Comment of Onion Lake Cree Nation
("Onion Lake"). The deadline for filing the Letter of Comment was Friday, November 13,
 2015 at noon MT. However, when we attempted to file the Letter of Comment prior to
 the deadline using the participation portal, the system would not accept the filing. We
 immediately contacted the process advisor, Matt Groza, who advised he would speak to
 the technical department at the National Energy Board. Prior to the close of business on
 November 13, Onion Lake provided Enbridge with a copy of its unfiled Letter of
 Comment.
 Earlier today, Mr. Groza advised that as Onion Lake was accepted as a late participant,
 it cannot access the participation portal and must file the Letter of Comment using the e-
file system.
