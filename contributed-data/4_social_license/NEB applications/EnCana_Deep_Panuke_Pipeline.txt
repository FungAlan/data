Dear Sirs/Mesdames:
Re:      Draft List of Issues - Public Review of Encana’s Panuke Offshore Gas Development
         Project Hearing GH-2-2006
We refer to the Draft List of Issues - Appendix I of Joint Directions on Pocedure - National
Energy Board Hearing GH-2-2006. In particular:
         Para 7.         "The potential impact on landowners...."
Notwithstanding that under Section 2 of the National Energy Board Act "lands" includes any
right or privilege in respect of lands, in vigorous and lengthy filings with the NEB regarding MH-
4-98 and MH-3-98, Sable Offshore Energy Inc and Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline Management
respectively held that persons holding mineral rights under a mineral exploration Licence granted
by the Crown in the Province of Nova Scotia, are not landowners for the purposes of the NEB
Act.
Accordingly, and so that a similar situation will not arise respecting GH-2-2006, we respectfully
ask that the NEB add to its List of Issues the following issue:
                 "The potential impact of the construction and operation of the
                 pipeline on mineral rights holders."
In its Reasons for Decision MH-4-98 and Reasons for Decision MH-3-98 the NEB found that:
"...the interests of Licence holders, while dependent on and related to the provincial Crown (or
mineral owner) and surface rights owners, form separate interests that, in the context of
determining a detailed route under the Act, may not be adequately addressed through contact
only with mineral and surface rights owners."
                                                   2
We feel it highly desirable and proper that the above stated issue be added to the final List of
Issues for the GH-2-2006 Hearing. In our view, stakeholders whose interests are impacted by
the construction and operation of a pipeline, whatever the nature of their interests, should not be
subjected to and have to engage in lengthy legal arguments as to whether their interests are a
proprietary interest in the lands, whether they are a "landowner", etc.
Should you have any questions or concerns in this regard, please do not hesitate to communicate
with us.
Yours truly,
A. Wayne Lockerby, P, Eng.

Dear Sirs/Mesdames: ‘
Re: Draft List of Issues - Public Review of Encana’s Panuke Offshore Gas Development
Project Hearing GH-2-2006
We refer to your Notice dated November 11, 2006, wherein you invite our Company to reply to
EnCana’s opposition to our Company’s request that the following issue be added to the List of
Issues:
"The potential impact of the construction and Operation of the
pipeline on mineral rights holders" ‘
By Agreement effective April 3, 2006, Greyhawk Ridge Minerals Inc. {"Greyhawk“) acquired
from Heartland Resources Inc. ("Heartland") 2111 of Heartland’s rights and interests, and assumed
all of Heartland’s obligations and liabilities, relating to exploration Licence No. 05867 covering
lands on Which SOEI and M&NP have constmeted pipelines, and on which we understand
EnCana proposes to construct its on land pipeline.
It would appear from the letter of Mr. Grant, EnCana’s legal counsel, dated December 6, 2006,
that EnCana’s basis for objecting to the matter of "The potential impact of the con emotion and
operation of the pipeline on mineral lights holders" being added to the List of Issues is the
‘ Decision of an Arbitration Committee in the matter of Heartland Resources Inc. (Heartland"),
Sable Offshore Energy Inc ("SOEI"), and Matitimes & Northeast Pipeline Management Ltd.
(“M&NP") (the "Decision").

PROJECT OVERVIEW

Introduction '

1. On 11 June 1996. Mobil on CanadaProPerties and Shell Canada Limited, on behalf ofthe
ﬁve proponents of the Sable Oﬂ’Shor: Energy Project ("305?"). applied to the National

- Enmgy Board (the “de") for a Certiﬁcate of Public: Convenicncc and Necessity to
th and 0pm: certain afﬁhore and onshore: pipelines. and related faciiixies, to prnduce
mural gas from the Scotian Shelf in the offshare area near Sable Island. The applinaiion
was the subject ofa public hearing [Hearing Order GH—6—96) held in thc spring and summer .
of 1997. Pursuant to Certiﬁcate No. GC-94, issued on 17 December 1997, the Board
approved the consnuction and Operation afﬁne facilities along the general route and in the
locaﬁon identiﬁed during the GH-6-96 hearing.

2. In approving the application. the Board referred to the mcogpmmgations of a. Jaint Public ‘

f .
Reﬁew Panel {consisﬁug of 5 mbers, 3 of whom were also memberrs of the Board) Which
considered the enﬁromnenul and secluaaconomic effects of the proposed pmjm. The
Board adopted these recommendations as cerﬁﬁcate ccnditions to its appzoval afﬁne SOEP
pmject and cdncluded 11131, in light 0f the mitigation measures to be. adopted, the pipeline and.
related fuili‘cics Were not likely to cause signiﬁcant adverse.- cavironmcnml effects.

3. Th: facilities approved by the Board imiude a 199.5 Idiometre (mcasurcd by thc horizontal
distance of the pipelinc, and no: the: actual lcngth of the pipe used), twou-phasc production

16 and 17 April 1998 as holder of minei'ai exploration rights on leads in the Goldberg area
ef Nova Scutin, as more particularly demibed in Exploration Licences #00450 and #00014
(the "Licences”). ‘
46. On 8 May 1998, SOEP proﬁded Heartlaﬁd with a map disclosing the preposed 'route ofthe
pipeline and the loeation of the 53.5 plant site, and requested further information from
Heartland in respect- ofthe'Licences. On 27 May 1998, 305? advised Heartland that it was
in the process of preparing the PPBaR. fur the pipeline. Capies of that correspandencc is .
attached for the Bond‘s reference at Appendix "3" hereto.
47. Heartland ﬁled with the Board an additional submission dated 8 July 1998 pusuant to
pmagraph 4(a) 0f the Hearing Order. Noeltemate route map was previded. HeartIand did
not raise any concerns with respect to the methods and timing of eonsuuction.
43. Subsequently. on 23 Juiy 1993, Heartland sent two letters to 3051, relating to the Licences
and to, inter alia, the construction ofthe enshore portion of the pipeline. Cepiee of those
letters. and SOEI'S neponsc thereto, are attached for the Board’s reference at Appendix “K"

As Mr. Grant correctly states, the subject Decision is presently under appeal, on questions of law, b
. before the Federal Court . T n'al Division, and it may well be that the decision of the Trial
Division will be taken by the unsuccessful party to the Federal Court - Appeal Division. ‘
' Greyhawk does not agee with Mr. Grant’s submission that "the decision of the Pipeline
Arbitration Committee is correct in law, .". That is obviously a matter yet to be determined by the
Courts. Accordingly, Greyhawk submits that the Public Review Secretariat ( the "Secretariat")
should attach no weight to the said Decision or to Mr. Grant’s arguments referencing or based on
the said Decision.
Rather, Greyhawk submits that, in detemtining whether it is appropriate and in the public interest
to include the matter of "The potential impact of the construction and operation of the pipeline on
' mineral rights holders", the Secretariat should review and focus its attention on decisions made
by the National Energy Board ("NEE") respecting the pipelines SOEI and M&NP constructed
and operate on these very same lands.
NEE Decisions MH«4-28 and MH-3-98
1. On or about June 9, 1998, Mobile Oil Canada Ltd. ("Mobil") (on behalf of Sable Offshore
Energy Proj eet ("SOEP")) applied to the NEE for approval of the Plan, Proﬁle and Book
of Reference resp eeting the detailed route of a natural gas transmission line from the
landfall point of its offshore pipeline, in the Goldboro area, Nova Scotia, to its gas
processing plant. . ‘

2. On or about March 20, 199 8, SOEP served on the Heartland, as a mineral rights holder, a
section 87(1) Notice dated March 17, 1998, (the "SOEP subsection 87(1) Notice").

3. The SOEP section 87(1) Notice referenced Heartland as "(being all the holder(s) of the
mineral rights or claims on the, lands hereinafter referred to in Schedule ”A", (collectively
the "Interest Holders") 3 portion of which lands are required by Sable Offshore Energy
Project ("SOEP") for a section or part of its pipeline)"

4. On or about June 26, 1998, the NEB approved the transfer of GC- 94 Certiﬁcate from

. Mobil to Sable Offshore Energy Inc. ("SOEI") . a
5, Section 34(4) of the Nationa! Energy Board Act applicable at that time ("NEB Act")
provided that:
"A person who anticipates that his lauds may be adversely affected a
by the proposed detailed route of a pipeline, other than an owner of
lands referred to in subsection (3), may oppose the detailed route
‘ by ﬁling With the Board within thirty days following the last

General Route aftha Pipeline

50. SOEI submits that HW'S objection relates to the general rout: of the pipcline in this
am," rather than the dataﬂad route application which is the subject of this pmceading. In its
submission, Heartland states that "[iJf the Pipeline is constructed and operated cm the

Backgrou nd
1.1 Regulatory Process for the Sable Gas Projects
Mobil Oil Canada Properties and Shell Canada Limited, on behalf of the ﬁve proponents of the Sable
Offshore Energy Project ("SOEP") and Maritimes 8: Northeast Pipeline Management Ltd- ("M&NP"),
conunenced the regulatory approval process for the "Sable Gas Projects" in 1995. The Sable Gas
Projects consist of several undertakings to drill, produce, n'ansport and process natural gas discovered
on the Scotian Shelf near Sabie Island.
In June 1996, SOEP applied to the National Energy Board ("NEB" or the "Board") for a Certificate of
Public Convenience and Necessity so construct certain offshore and onshcmre pipelines, and related
facilities, to transport gas produced in the offshore area near Sable Island. Gas and associated natural
gas liquids ("NGLs") wcmld be collected from offshore drilling platforms and brought onshore by
means of a submarine pipeline to a gas plant located near Goldboro, Nova Scotia. NGLS would be
transported from the gas plant by an onshore pipeline to Point Tupper, Nova Scotia for funhex
- processing and shipping.
In October 1996, M&NP applied under section 52 of the Named! Energy Board Act (the "Act") for a
Certiﬁcate of Public Convenience and Necessity to construct and operate an onshore pipeline.
M&NP’S proposed pipeline WOuld ship natural gas deveioped by SOEP from the SOEP gas plant near
Goldboro to markets in the Maritimes and the northeastern United States. M&NP anticipated the
building,r of lateral pipelines (e.g. to Halifax, NS and to Saint John, NB) to develop gas markets in the
Maritimes.
A ﬁve person Joint Public Review Panel was established ta mnduct a review of the Sable Gas
Projects. Both SOEP’S and M&NP’S applications were considered at the GH-6-96 public hearing
during the spring and summer of 1997 and the Joint Public Review Panel Report was issued by the
Panel in October 1997. In its report, the Panel concluded that the 305p and the M&NP pipelines
were not likely to cause signiﬁcant adverse mvironmental effects.
On 17 December 1997, Pursuant to Certiﬁcates GC-94 and GC-95, the Board approved the.
construction and operation of the SOEP and M&NP facilities, reapectively The SOEP proponents
racemly formed Sable Offshore Energy Inc. ("SOEI" or the "Company") to hold their interest in the
Sable Gas Projects.
1.2 Description of the SOEI Facilities
The SOEI facilities would include an 200 km offshme submarine pipeline which would connect the
Thebaud platform near Sable Island to a landfall point approximately three km to the southeast of the
Village of Goldboro, Nova Scotia. From this point, a 1.5 km onshore pipeline would be constructed
to the boundary of the gas plant site. The site of the gas plant covers approximately 50 hectares, and
would be located three km east of Goldboro, south of Gold Brook Lake and west of Seal Harbour

statement setting out the nature of that person’s W h
M and the grounds for opposition to the proposed detailed route
of the pipeline." [emphasis added] .

b 6. Believing that there was a reasonable altemate route which would do less damage to
Heartland, on or about July 8, 1998, and pursuant to subsection 34(4) of the NEB Act,
Heartland ﬁled a notice of opposition with the NBB respecting SOBI’S preposed detailed
route.

. 7. There Were only two obj eoting parties to SOEI’S proposed detailed route, both being

affected holders of mineral exploration Licences.

8. On or about July 14, 1998, the NEB issued Hearing Order MH-4F98 (Appendix I).

~ 9. Hearing Order MH—4u98 advised landowners and interested parties that: "Therefore, ‘

pursuant to subsection 35 of the Act, the Board will hold public heaﬁngs to consider the
statments 0i oppogjtion which meet the Leguirements of the Act." [emphasis added]

10. Healing Order MH—4—98 references Headland as a landowner and its obj ectecl lands as
being mineral rights located about 31011. East of Goldboro.

11. In its "Additional Written Information" to the NEE dated July 30, I998 SOEI made
vigorous arguments, and at paragraph 49 stated: "As more particularly discussed below,
SOEI respectfully submits that (i) Heartland’s objections do not ﬁt within the scope of the
hearing envisaged by the hearing Order lvﬂrI-4-9 8"; At paragraph 65 SOEI submitted that:

‘ "Heartland is not a "landowner" as deﬁned in the Hearing Order..." (Appendix 11').

12. It is apparent that, notwithstanding vigorous arguments to the contrary made by SOEI,
the NEB determined that the affected holders of mineral exploration Licences had an
interest in lands and were persons who anticipated that their lands may be adversely
affected by the proposed detailed route of SOEI’s pipeline.

13. Detailed Route Hearing MH—4~98 was heid in Halifax on August 11 8:; 12, 1998.

14. In its Reasons for Decision Hearing Order MH-4-98 (Appendix III), among other
things, the NEB found: .

(i) "The approval process prescribed by the Act for considering the detailed route is
designed to involve all affected lmdowngs and other affected patties."

(ii) "SOEI did not consult with the holders of the Licences during the course of its
detailed route selection process."

(iii) "It is regrettable that SOEI did not choose to consult directly and/or meaningﬁﬂly
with the holders of mineral exploration licences during the platming phase of the
detennination of the detailed route. The establishment of positive working

Lake, Nova Scotia. The gas plant has been previously approved by the Board and exernpted from the .
detailed route hearing process. ~
1.3 Second Stage of Approval Process - Determination of the Detailed

Route ‘
Certiﬁcate GC-94 granted SOEI the approval of a pipeline within a speciﬁed 500, metre wide corridor.
Under the proviSions of the Act, however, the detailed route is determined during a second stage of
approval.
The aggroval Emcess Erescribed by the Act for censidering the detailed route is designed to involve 911..
WTMS process begins when the Company ﬁles its plan, ‘
proﬁle and book of referenee (”PPBOR") for the detailed teute. The PPBOR identiﬁes the precise
location of the pipeline including the lands to be crossed, the types and amounts of land rights
required, and the affected landowners and tenants.
Once the PPBOR has been ﬁled, paragraph 34(1)(a) of the Act requires the Company to serve a notice
on alt landowners from whom land or land rights are proposed to be acquired. This notice describes
the proposed detailed route of the pipeline and the procedure to be followed in making objections to
the Board, Pursuant to paragraph 34(1)(b) of the Act, the Company must also arrange to publish a
notice in at least one issue of a local newspaper. The public notice must include the same infonnatien
as the paragraph 34(1)(e) notice. Landowners opposing the proposed detailed route have 30 days after
receiving the notice to file a written statement with the Secretary of the Board and the Company
explaining their interest and their reasons for opposition. Other affected parties have 30 days after the
last publication of the public notice to ﬁle an objection with the Board
If no objections to the detailed route are received, the Board may approve the PPBoR without a public
hearing. However, if an objection to the route is received, the Board must hold a public hearing in the
area where the relevant lands are located. After reviewing all of the evidence, the Board determines.
the best possible detailed route. A copy of the Board’s decision is required to be sent to the Minister
of Namml Resources and to each person whe made representations at the hearing.
1.4 Detailed Route Hearing Issues
The issues to be considered in detailed mute hearings are limited, pursuant to section 36(1) of the Act,
to: t _
a) the best possible route of the pipeline; and
b) the most appropriate methods and timing of constructing the pipeline.
Issues previously addressed in the context of the certiﬁcate hearing, such as the need for the pipeline
and its general route, were not reconsidered during the course of the detailed route hearings. Further,
compensation issues were not considered since, as indicated in the Board’s MH-4—98 Directions on
Procedure ("DOP"), the Board has no authority to consider compensation matters for landowners. The
Federal Minister of Natural Resources has the responsibility to determine disputes related to
compensation through negotiation and/or arbitration preceedings.

1.5 Scope of Board’s Mandate to Consider Alternate Routes
The Board is of the view that, in the. context of considering a spaciﬁc landowner objection to thee~
. detailed route. as ﬁled by the company, it has no jurisdiction to approve the route outside the corridor
in the absence: of an application by the pmpomnt. The. Board will hear evidence on alternate routes ‘
outside the corridor for the sole purpose of assisting it in determining whether the proposed detailcd
' route, as applied for by the Company, should be approved. .

The Application: Detailed Route
. _________________._.________
2.1 Pipeline Route and Location of Facilities Selection
SOEI used a four step plarming process to detexmine the location of all of the facilities, the objective
Of the last Stet) Of which was to identify the preferred corridor for the onshore pipeline.

I Step 1 involved the selection of the Country Harbour area as the preferred corridor for bringing the
neutral gas ﬁom the Thebaud offshore platfonn to landfall. The result of Step 1 was that the Isaacs
Harbour landfeIl was chosen. Step 2 identiﬁed the preferred location for the gas plant within the ‘
Century Harbour area- Step 3. identiﬁed the prefened gas plant site within that area, involving a
detailed comparison of alternatives. Finally, Step 4 identiﬁed the preferred corridor for the ncarshore
and onshore portion of the pipeline.

SOEI then applied to the Board for approval of a 500 metre wide corridor fer a 1.5 km onshore
pipeline to be constructed from the landfail point to the boundary of the gas plant site. Following the
GH-6-96 proceedings, the applied-fer 500 metre wide corridor was approved. ’

2.2 Detailed Route Selection

Working within the 500 meme corridor, SOB! deﬁned a right-of—way ("ROW") between the landfall .
point and the gas plant, having regard to environmentat constraints and comm] featuxes. The Row is
the actual area Where the pipeline will be constructed and is 25 metres wide. However, from landfall
to about 700 metres along the proposed detailed route, SOEI has deﬁned an easement of 100 metres in
width in order to accommodate temporary working space for initial construmjon of the pipeline. A
structured set of guiding principles was utilized to delineate the ROW.

2.3 Detailed ROW Selection Criteria: Primary and Secondary Principles
The ﬁtet primary principle utilized by $0151 to determine the alignment of the pipeline Row within
the appmved 500 metre corridor placed an emphasis on selecting a direct route between defined
control features. In SOEI’s view, the need to select a direct route is very much a product of the
presence of strong control features in combination with the physical design parameters of the pipeline,
namely the relatively large size of the pipeline, large wall thickness of the pipeline, and the overall,
relatively short length of the pipeline. In this case, a direct route is required to the greatest extent
pessible, in order to minimize any bends in a relatively short, yet large diameter pipeline.

The second primery principle used by 80131 to determine the detailed route of the pipeiine was the
need to minimize the overall length of the pipeline. This principle is based on minimizing potential
environmental impacts, minimizing capital and operating costs, and minimizing the number of affected
landowners-

4 MH—4-98

12f12f2l86 1E]: 54 982-275-3438 FIRST EﬁSTERN MGMT PAGE 34
: The following secondary principles wwc also utilized by 30131 in the delineation of the: Row:
a) adhere to the guidelines associated with three classes of constraints; and
b) minimize the crossing of privatc lands, lands subject to title: disputes and lands within
Land Title Clariﬁcation Areas. Land Title Clariﬁcation areas are areas of lands within
Nova Scotia the ownership of which is in question. T hese areas were avoided to the
eXtent possible in order to minimize interference with private lands, and to bypass
altogether lands for which ownership is disputed or in Question. ‘
2.4 Constraint Classes
The three different constraint classes utilized by SOEI are described in the following table- ‘

2.5 Other ROW Selection Considerations ,
In addition to the principles and constraints discussed above, SOEI also considered the following
factors during the ROW selection process:

at) avoiding impact on buildings, residences, land use and developed areas;

b) paralleling existing utility or transportation corridors;

c) ensuring side slopes or steep slopes in additiOn to those identiﬁed as class 3 constraints .
were avoided where practical;

d) avoiding transecting comers of properties;

e) ensuring the location for crossing other utility corridors does not impact the other
utility or the pipeiine;

f) ensuring the availability of access to the ROW; ‘

g) ensuring a 70-90 degree crossing angie at roads;

It) ensuring as close to a 90 degree angle at major highways, and signiﬁcant watercourses
where practical; and

i) ensuring required temporary working room is available at road crossings, railway
crossings, watercourse crossings, and for grade cuts.

2.6 Control Features ‘

Due in part to the relationship 0f the onshore pipeline with the overall project, and to the application
of the detailed routing criteria, the detailed route of the onshore portion of the pipeline was inﬂuenced
by the following control features: '

. a) the deﬁned location of the landfall point at the eastern terminus of the route;

b) the deﬁned location of the gas plant site at the western terminus of the route;

c) the presence of private lands, the ownership of which is currently subject to dispute
between an estate and various beneﬁciaries (the "Estate Lands“) to the northwest of the
initial portion of the route; and ‘

d) the presence of Land Title Clariﬁcation Areas, the ownership of which is currently in
question (the ’fLTC Lands"), to the south of the mid and latter portions of the route.

2.7 Description of Route Alignment

' The onshore portion of the pipeline would comence at the landfall point, and proceed in a
northeasterly direction along the northern most boundary of the lands owned by Nova Scotia Power
Inc. ("NSF") at the request of NSF. The route would cross a utility con-idor held by NSP, at
approximately a 90 degree angle. This initial portion of the route is handed along the north by the
Estate Lands. ~
The reute then would continue to a paint at the southeastern boundary of the Estate Lands, jog very
slightly to the north, and then enter lands owned by the Province of Nova Scotia. This mid portion of
the route is handed along the South by LTC Lands. The route then would proceed along the northern
bcundary of the LTC Lands to the gas plant site. Just prior to entry onto the gas plant lands, the
pipeline would jog slightly to the north in order to accommodate a creek crossing.

2.8 Board Comments on SOEI’s Detailed Route Selection Process
' 2.8.1 Consultation
It is regrettable that SOEI did not choose to consult directly and/or meaningfully wivh the holders 0f
mineral exﬁibration licences during the Blaming ghase of tﬁe Hetermination of the detailed route. The
establishment of positive worldng relationships with those parties who hold ﬁghts in the land is
' essential to me. ongoing operations of the pipeline. Looking forward in time, it will be necessary to ‘
' work together with the mineral exploration licence holders, mineral owners, the provincial crown and
surface rights owners to ensure that the resource development - both natural gas and other valued
resources - can coexist. This coexistence is neither unusual nor impossible‘ Unfortunately, SOEI may
have Comanced its relatimship with mineral explomtion liCenCe holders in a negative fashion.

W
3.1 Objections by Holders of Mineral Exploration Licences ‘
~ The Board received objections to SOEI’s detailed route from two holders of Mineml Exploration
Licences (the "Licences") issued by the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources (the "DNR").
The Board considered those objections in hearings held in Halifax, Nova Scotia on 11 and 12 August
1998.
3.2 General Board Comments with respect to Holders of Mineral
ExploratiOn Licences
A number of facts detennined in these two hearings are common to both of the objections.
- SOEI did not consult with the holders of the Licences during the course of its detailed
route selection process- “—
- The Licences, which give the holders the right to search and prospect for metals and to
apply for a mining lease within the areas described by the Licences, are valid and in good
‘ standing.
- A Licence, by its terms, was issued and is held Subject to the rights of the owner, occupant
or tenant of the land covered by the Licence and to the provisions of the relevant
provincial laws.
~ One of the important requirements applicable to the Licences is that, prior to carrying out
any exploration activities, the holders must obtain permission for surface access from the
, DNR. By letter dated 7 August 1998, courage! for Sable Offshore Energy Inc. was advised
by Rosalind C. Penfound, Executive Director, Land Services Branch of the DNR that the
local DNR ofﬁce for the Guysbmouglt area had been advised "that surface access for
mineral exploration on Crown land should not be given for any lands . . . in respect of
which certiﬁcates have been isSued by the National Energy Board " The 7 August
letter did not explicitly describe the Licences affected by this direction; nor was there any
reference to the proposed detailed route of the pipeline.
° No speciﬁc applications have been made for surface access by any of the affected Licence
holders; and, accordingly, there was no evidence in these proceedings that either of these ‘
Licence holders has been denied surface access.
The provincial Crown has the authority to deny surface access to a Licence holder upon application, 01
to revoke the Licences, thereby effectively extinguishing the rights of the Licence holders to object to
the detailed route of the pipeline. There was, however, no evidence that any of these actions had been
taken by the DNR in respect of any of the LiCence$ held by the objectors in these proceedings, In the
' 4"” Board’s view, unless and until such deﬁnitive actions are taken, the interests of the Licence holders,

*9 With respect to these objections. the Board is of the view that the failure to consult earl in the
p arming process with holders of Licences guts into question the integrity of the Emposed detailed
route selection process. Speciﬁcally, the Board questions whether involvement of the Licence holders

m the route selection process could have resulted m a different apphedtor detmled route. .
Be that as it may, the Board must now consider whether the respective detailed routes for which
approvals are requested are the best possible detailed routes, having regard to all relevant factors,
including the comparative merits ef any proposed alternatives and the interests of the Licence holders.
. 3.3 Speciﬁc Mineral Rights Cases
The objections for which a heating was held are summarized below and appear in the order in which
they were heard by the Board. . ‘
3.3.1 Kevin McAllister
Description of Proposed Route (PPBoR Sheet 1)
Mr. Kevht McAllister holds three Licences issued under the Nova Scotia Minerai Resources Act in the
vicinity of the pipeline landfall: at Ragged Point, Ragged Rock and at Dung Cove. The offshore
approach and proposed onshore route would traverse the Dung Cove Licence area, which spans the
‘ width of the 500 m wide corridor.
The onshore portion of the SOEI's proposed detailed pipeline route starts at landfall in Isaees Harbour,
approximately 3 km southeast of the village 0f Goldboro, in Guysborough County, NS. The detailed
route then proceeds in a northeast direction.
SOEI identiﬁed two control points for the preposed route: the point of landfall and the gas plant site.
The point of landfall was determined based on near shore hathymetry and the depth requirements of h
the pipe laying vessel, the requirements for a straight section of pipe at the near shore and landfall
locations, the minimum axe radius of the near shore pipe, and avoiding features such as archaeological
sites. recreational dive sites and ﬁsh habitat. Another constraint to the landfall location was the
avoidance of lands where ownership was in question. As the gas plant is already under construction,
its location is therefore a central point for the detailed route.
This portion of the route crosses mixed terrain including immature and mature deciduous forest and
several wetercovrees ineluding Betty’s Cove Brook and a wetland area.
Nature of Objection
Mr. McAllister objected to the proposed route on the basis that the alignment would adversely affect
his mineral exploratiOn activities. He else objected to the lack of consultation provided by SOEI to
him as a Licence holder

Alternate Route
No aitemate route was proposed. Mr. MeAllister stated that he did not have the expertise to put
forward an alternate route and that this would be the responsibility of 301-31.
Views of the Parties ' .
Mr. McAllister stated that the proposed easement would run between two of his Licence areas and
_ indicated that he believed that he would not be able to explore within the 100 metre easement. He
also stated that activities typically associated with exploration such as the use of heavy machinery, ‘
blasting and melting are incompatible with the presence of a pipeline. In addition, Mr. McAllister
expressed his belief that the presence of the pipeline would render the probability of a mining
' company developmg the Dung Cove mineral resource nil.
SOEI stated that the proposed route was determined having regard for its route selection criteria. The
proposed route would he the shortest possible route, thereby minimizing surface dismrbanee, length
and cost. It would align with the existing foundations and tie-in point for the slug catcher at the gas ‘
plant site. The proposed route would avoid a property for which the land title is currently under
dispute, and it would further parallel existing property boundaries for much of its length.
SOEI Stated that mineral claims/leases were considered as one of the constraint Critel'la selected during
the identiﬁcation of the preferred nearushore and onshore corridor, but that no alternate COJTidOI was
possible that could by~pass ail claims/leases. When selecting the proposed route, SOEI identiﬁed
existing mineral claims as a Class 3 constraint. which may require special construction practices and
which would be avoided where practical.
Mr. McAllister stated that pub: to receiving a Section 37 notice in March 1998, he was not aware that
SOEI intended to "go into that area, particularly Dung Cave" and therefore had not participated in any
of the public consultation proceedings. Mr. McAllister argued that SOEI should have considered
potential effects to the underlying mineral resources when determining the detailed route.
SOEI stated that although it was aware of Mr. McAllister’s Licences during the summer of 1996, it
did not contact him because, at that time, infortnation from the DNR indicated that there were no
Surface Access Agreements registered for the Licence areas.
Views of the Board
The Board notes that Mr. MeAllister’s Licence area extends across the entire corridor
in this area, so that his interests Would be affected wherever the detailed mute was
located in the corridor. The Board also notes Mr- McAllister's evidence that any route
that crosses his Licence area would be unacceptable to him- The Board is therefore of
the View that, had SOEI consulted with Mr. MeAlliater prior to detennining the
. detailed route, the proposed route would likely be no different.
The Board is of the View that all televant criteria were applied and weighted in an
appmpriate manner in the determination of the proposed route. The Board is satisﬁed,
. therefore, that the route pmposed by SOEI is the best possible detailed route. ,

relationships with those parties who held r1 ts in the 1 id is essential to the
ongoing operations of the pipeline."
(iv) "..... the interests of licence holders, while dependent on and related to the

' ' provincial Crown (or mineral owner) and surface rights owners, form separate

interests that, in the context of determining a detailed route under the Act, may not

be adequately addressed through contact only with mineral and surface rights

omers."

' . (v) "With respect to these objections, the Board is of the view that the failure to
consult eaﬁy in the planning process with holders ef Licences puts into question
the integrity of the proposed detailed route selection process. Speciﬁ cally, the
Board questions whether involvement of the Licence holders in the route selection
process could have resulted in a different applied-for detailed route."

(vi) "The board notes that Heartland’s Licence area extends across the entire corridor
in this area, and that its 'nterests wou d be af eeted wherever the detailed r0 te
is located in the corﬂ'dor."

[emphasis added]

15. A virtually identical process to that described above occurred, including identical ﬁndings

by the NEE in its Reasons for Decision MH-3-98 respecting M&NP’S pipeline-

16. The Municipality of the District of Guysborough has never denied Greyhawk, (or
Heartland before it) surface access to the subject lands.

17. And in any eVent, were Greyhawk unable to obtain surface access from the Mmlieipality,
pursuant to Section 100 of the Mineral Resources Act Greyhawk has the 11' ght to apply to
the Minister for a surface ﬁghts permit to pass over, enter upon and work the lands
comprising its Licence, and the minister may grant a surface rights pennit unto Greyhawk
upon such terms and conditions as the Minister determines. Further, there is no appeal
from the granting by the Minister of a surface rights permit (App endix IV).

18. Accordingly, the ultimate and ﬁnal detennination as to whether Greyhawk can pass over,
enter upon or work the lands covered by its Licence is made by the Minister, not by the
Municipality. ..

' 19. The Minister has never determined not to grant a surface access permit to Greyhawk (or
Heartland before it) respecting the lands held under the subject eXptoration Licence.

20. Greyhawlc submits that the NEB has already, thoroughly, considered the nature of mineral
rights in Nova Scotia and, in the result, determined that, for the purposes of the NEE Act, ‘
holders of mineral exploration Licences in Nova Scotia hold lands and/or rights in lands
and/or interests in lands. Any question in this regard which may have existed prior to
MH—4-98 and MH—3—98 is now resjudz‘cata-

Decision .
The Board finds that the detailed route proposed by SOEI is the best possible
route for the pipeline in this case, and that SOEI has committed to the most
, appropriate methods and timing of construction. ‘ ‘
3.3.2 Heartland Resources Inc.
Description of Proposed Route
Heartland Resources Inc- ("Heartland") indicated that it holds Licences which give it the right to
explom for gold deposits within a defined area that underlies the proposed route.
The onshore portion of SOEI’s prepoeed detailed pipeline route starts at landfall in Isaacs Harbour,
approxhnately three km southeast of Goldboro, in Guysborough County, NS. The detailed mute
would then proceed in a nonheast direction.
SOEI identiﬁed two control points for the proposed route: the point of Iandfall and the gas plant site. ‘
The point of landfall was determined based on near shore bathymetry and the depth requixements of
the pipe laying vessel, the requirements for a straight section of pipe at the near shore and landfall
locations, the minimum arc radius of the near shore pipe, and avoiding features such as archaeological
sites, recreational dive sites and ﬁsh habitat. Another constraint to the landfall location was the
avoidance of lands Where ownership was in question. As the gas plant is already under construction
its location is therefore a control point for the detailed route.
' This portion of the route crosses mixed terrain including immature and mature deciduous forest and
several watercourses including Betty‘s Cove Brook and :a wetland area.
Nature of Objection '
Heartland stated that SOEI’s proposed detailed route for the pipeline would sigrﬁﬁcantly impede its
ability to cany out its planned exploration program for the area and there would be a signiﬁcant effect
on the market value of its securities.
Alternate Route
An alternate route for the pipeline was proposed by Heartiand. The alternate route would start at
landfall on the west side of the 500 metre certiﬁcated een‘ider- At this point, it would bend in a
northeasterly direction, roughly parallel and adjacent to the corridor edge until it reached the gas plant
. site- The alternate route would remain entirely within the corridor.
Views of the Parties
Heartland stated that the construction of the pipeline would affect its planned exploration activities if
the construction occurred before September 1999. It stated that it planned to explore the area from
October 1998 until September 1999. t

With respect to timing of construction, SOEI expressed concern that delay of the conStruction would
impac: the start—up of the overall project and would be prejudicial to the success and feasibility of the
project. It noted that because Heartland does not have surface access to conduct exploration and that
it is not likely to receive surface access permission, a delay in the construction is not justiﬁed and
would not resolve issues regarding Heartland’s mineral interests.

Heartland argued. that SOEI’s consultation process failed to consider the interests of holders of
Licences.
SOEI argued that there are no current surface access permits granted to Crown lands in the area of the
proposed route. SOEI submitted that, based on correspondence to SOEI from the DNR, there WOuld
not be any surface access granted for mineral exploration on Crown lands to which certiﬁcates have
been issued by the Board.
SOEI stated that the proposed route was determined having regard for its route selection criteria. The
proposed route would he the shortest possible route, thereby minimizing surface disturbance, length
and cost. It would align with the existing foundations and tie—in point for the slug catcher at the gas
plant site. The proposed route would avoid a property for which the land title is cunently under
dispute, and it would ﬁn‘ther parallel existing property boundaries for much of its length.
~ Heartland submitted that the alternate route would not be signiﬁcantly longer than the proposed route.
In addition, the altemate route would still be Within the certiﬁcated corridor. The alternate route
would cause less of an impact on Heartland because it is located in an area that has lower potential for
exploration than the area of the proposed route.
SOEI argued that Heartland did not take into consideration factors other than those which would cause
the least impact to Heartland. Heartland did not consider the interests of other landowners or that
environmental constraints had been identiﬁed and weighed. SOEI submitted that it had significant .
concerns with the alternate route including: increased length to the pipeline and thereby increased '
surface disturbance; two ninety degree bends in the pipe; the crossing of additional lands that are
currently not part of the proposed route; increased constmction costs; eonstmetion across side slopes
beside Betty’s Cove Brook Which would contravene a condition imposed on SOEI by the Nova Scotia
Minister for the Environment; and construction difficulties at the control points.
View of the Board 2
7‘6 The Board notes that Heartland’s Licence area extends across the entire corridor in this
area and that its interests would be affected wherever the detailed route is located in
. the corridor.
Heartland’s request for a delay in construction to allow it to carry out its exploration
program is at this time an open—ended request for delay of the project. Heartland does
not presently have consent for surface access which would make the timing of any
. exploration program uncertain. In the Board’s view it would not be appropriate to
require SOEI to delay construction in these circumstances.

12;“1'232685 18: 54 982-2?5-3438 FIRST E&STEE‘N MGMT PﬁGE 44
The Board notes SOEI’s commitment to work with Heartland to mitigate the impacts
of the pipeline on future exploration and mining activities that may occur in the:
vicinity of the: easement- ‘
On the evidence concerning ﬁle proposed and alternate routes, the Board is persuaded
that Heartland’s alternate route poses patential problems which are not present on the
praposed route and that on balance the proposed route is superior to the alternate.
The Board is of the view mat all relevant criteria were applied and weighted in an
appropriate manner. The Board is satisfied, therefore, that the route proposed by SOEI
is the best possibie detailed route.
Decision .
The Board finds that the detailed route proposed by SOEI is the best possible
route for the pipeline in this case, and that SOEI has committed to the most
appropriate methods and timing of construction.

7.4.4 Social Factors
7.4.4.1 Land and Water Use
Constmcﬁon of the pipeline hem landﬁll to the tie-in with the MN? main natural gas hansmission
line has the potential to disrupt land and water use. These most directly impacted would include the
land owners, or users, and the municipality.
:1) Analysis .
A3 maimed in Section 4.4.1.4, the routing of the pipeline from landfall to the tie-in location is
largely through lands that have been distm'bed in the recent past, or are grown over with alder scrub. ’
No active logging is taking place on any of these lands. As depicted on Figure 4.15, the GCRDA, in
association with the Municipality. has designated and acquired 600 acres of land adjaeem to the
SOB! gas plant for the Goldboro industrial Park. The preposed right-of-way for the pipeline crosses
this area. The ﬁnal routing will be negotiated with the municipality to ensure minimal disruption to
potential industrial development sites.

secured, the development and ggemﬁog 9f the Project will have insigniﬁcant imgacm on land and
water use. This mediation is made with certainty. The decommissioning of the Project will have no
“es impact on land and water use. This prediction is made with certainty.
7.4.4.2 First Nation? Land a; Water Use
As indicated in Section 4.4.1.1, there is evidenee that the Mi’kmaq historically frequented axeas in
the vicinity of Country and Isaac’s harbours. Further, as referenced in Section 4.3.2.4, First Nations‘
peoples have acquired licenses to ﬁsh in the nearshore and oﬁ'shore waters, hmluding licenses to ﬁsh
in waters in proximity to the pipeline and its landfall. Consideration of effects, if any, on such
commercial lieenses are addressed in Sections 7.4.1.6 and 7.5.1.6, which address the Project’s
impact an the inshore and oﬁ'shore ﬁsheries respectively.

21. Greyka draws the Secretariat’s attention to the fact that, in EnCana’s Predeeessor,
PanCanadian Energy’s Octob er 2002 Comprehensive Smdy Report respecting the Deep
Panuke Project, PanCanadian states, among other things, that: a
(i) "Although there are no active mineral workings in the vicinity of the proposed
~ pipeline corridor, there are lands subject to mineral licenses (see Figure 4.15)
including licences on property that extends across the proposed pipeline corridor.
Access through all lands will have to be negotiated with the landowner, including,
where appropriate, the Crown. It will also be necessaty to notify and consult with
those parties who hold mineral licences." (Appendix V - Deep Panuke Volume 5 a
March 2002, 766).
(ii) PanCanadian will need to negotiate successfully With the land owners and those
who hold rights to land to ﬁnalize the alignment of the right-of-way. Once such ‘
rights of way have been successfully secured, the development and operation of
the project will have significant impacts on land and water use. This prediction is
made with celtainty." (Appendix V .. Deep Panuke Volume 5 March 2002, 7-36)-
(iii) At table 4.6 and with respect to the Economy, PanCanadian states: "Mineral
licenses will be important, particulaxiy if PanCanadian decides to use the same
pipeline route as SOEI."(Appendix V - Deep Panuke Volume 6 March 2002, 4—9).

18. It is very signiﬁcant that EnCana’s legal counsel, Mr. Grant, states in his December 6,

2006, submission that the Municipality has established a "pipeline conidor” and that the
EnCana pipeline is proposed to run parallel to the existing pipeline of Sable Offshore
Energy Inc."

19, In its Decisions MH—4-98 the NEB found: "The Board notes that Heartland’s licence area
extends across the entire corridor in this area and that its interests would be affected .
wherever the 80H” 5 pipeline is located in the corridor."

20. It is axiomatic that Greyhawk’s interests will similarly be affected wherever EnCana may
construct its pipeline within the corridor.

21. The Draft List of Issues identiﬁed "The potential impact on landowners and Comunities

affected by the selected onshore portion of the proposed pipeline."

22. While Greyhawk veﬁtably believes that it own lands for the pumoses of the NEB Act,

and that any question in this regard is resjudicata, Greyhawk fully anticipated that, like
SOEI and M&NP before it, EnCana would make submission(s) to the Secretariat to the
conhary. Mr. Grant’s letter of December 6, 2006, has conﬁrmed Greyhawk’s
expectation in this regard.
The NEE, havmg previously detennined that the interests of Heartland (now Greyhawk’s
interests) would be affected wherever SOEI’s and M&NP’S pipelines were located in the
eorridor(s), Greyhawk submits that the matter of "The potential impact of the construction and

A number of questions were raised regarding installation methods for platfonns and pipelines. that
cannot be answered in detail until further engineeting studies have been completed. . ‘
ENGO stakeholders expressed concern that the level of infauna data gathered from surveys of the '
benthie habitat are inadequate to understand and assess potential (henthie) envixonmemal effects. They
preposed that PanCanadian consider more detailed survey data acquisition and potential linkages or
collaboration with research institutions such as Dalhousie University and the Bedford Institute ""
Oceanography be developed to participate in analyzing enhanced data sets. ‘
Economy
Two views were expressed regarding the economic implications of pipeline routing. One view supported
the creation and maintenance of ”transportation corridors" in which pipelines and cables mid be
concentrated. This view is in line with the Energy Strategy launched by the pmvineini government,

' which calls for “eonidoﬁzation” of pipelines. A second view put forward by some local ﬁshers related
to the fairness of concentrating potential effects in one area. Fishers in the Goldboro area had already
had to cope with the effects of constructing the SOEI line perhaps it was now “someone else’s turn“.

_ With respect to offshore ﬁshing interests, the main concern raised was the effect of unhm'ied sections of
pipeline on ﬁshing Operations. Some captains will not ﬁsh over pipelines for fear of possible gear
%~ damage. The pipeline route then effective! becomes a defame exclusion zone. ~

Q’QPI‘EMQ 9
Proj ect consider not only existing protected areas, but also potential impacts on future capacity to
develop an effective network of marine protected areas.

For successful oceans management, it is integral that “planning for MPAs and planning
for marine resource use should continue in parallel, not as separate ventures” (Willison 2002: 19).
And again, this is the stated intent of our federal government, as set out in Canada’s Federal
Marine Protected Areas Strategy. One of the aims of this strategy is to establish “a network of
marine protected areas Within a broader sustainable ocean management planning framework”
(DFO 2005z7). And yet, while the development of projects for resource exploitation continues to
move forward, “protecting Canada’s threatened marine biodiversity has become a hostage of
political tardiness” (Willison 2002: 1 8). Marine protection measures, where they are being
implemented at all, are proceeding at slower than a snail’s pace, while resource exploitation
continues on relatively unchecked. These efforts need instead to be occurring in concert (if not
protection prior to exploitation, rather than the other way around). The development of the Deep
Panuke Project must take account of and make concessions to a broader protected areas planning
process. This can be achieved by making every effort to collaborate with those engaged in marine
conservation and conservation planning efforts throughout proj ect development to ensure that the
Proj ect can have minimal impacts on the development of a network of marine protected areas.

Moreover, one of the obj ectives of the Federal Marine Protected Areas Strategy is “to
establish a more systematic approach to marine protected area planning and establishment” (DFO
2005:3). Yet proj ects both for protection and exploitation continue to be analyzed largely on an
ad hoc and case-by-case basis, rather than in a more systematic and proactive manner. Among
other reasons, this can be problematic because establishing a system of marine protected areas is
not about only protecting individual sites of particular interest due to evident high biodiversity
and productivity. To be effective, protected areas networks need to include areas that are
important for a variety of purposes and uses at a variety of life stages for marine organisms, and
they also need to include buffer areas and connective corridors. Such important ecosystem
functions may not immediately be evident simply from limited site-speciﬁc surveys, in the
absence of a bigger-picture approach, which is why a higher level of systems planning is
required. In addition, systems planning for marine protected areas can be of great beneﬁt to
industrial interests as well. As stated by Smith et al. in a WWF-Canada report, “a well-planned
network of MPAs, as opposed to an open—ended case-by-case approach, can provide certainty to
industry and avoid stranding intellectual and capital assets by making clear what areas can and
cannot be developed, now and in the future” (2006223). By collaborating With those engaged in
marine conservation and conservation planning, there is a better chance of avoiding conﬂicts With
current and ﬁiture conservation initiatives.

An example of a potential conﬂict of this nature can be found in a report compiled jointly
by World Wildlife Fund (WWF) — Canada and the Conservation Law Foundation — USA. These
two organizations have undertaken efforts to begin to develop a systematic plan for a network of
marine protected areas in Maritime Canada and New England. According to their ﬁndings (CLF
and WWF 2006), one of the priority conservation areas to be included in such a network is a
25568ka area of the Scotian Shelf that extends from the shelf edge north to Sable Island Bank,
west of Sable Island (priority area #24). This is of concern, as the Project would appear to be in
the same Vicinity as this priority conservation area. This area has been identiﬁed as important for
a number of reasons, including being an important habitat area for both juvenile and adult ﬁsh of

/
WQPAWé 1°
a number of species, as well as an area of consistently high primary productivity. It is because of
such potential interactions and conﬂicts that proceeding with proj ects such as Deep Panuke in the
absence of an established protected areas systems plan or an ocean zoning scheme is highly
undesirable. This is also why collaboration With those engaged in marine conservation and
conservation planning should be an important part of project development for any offshore gas
proj ect. The area may constitute an important conservation opportunity that could be impacted by
the Proj ect, although this was not identiﬁed through the site~speciﬁc surveys that were carried
out. Impacts of the Project on this area and its status as a priority area for conservation must be
given due consideration.

The ES SIM process presents some potential solutions to issues such as these. However, as
examined in the section below, it too is slow in reaching the stage of development and
implementation where it may begin to have some real effect.

Until such time as a more adequate management and protection system is in place for the
Scotian Shelf region, to ensure that resource use is properly balanced with the maintenance of
healthy ecosystem functioning, industrial development should proceed only with great caution.
Without higher-level planning, case-by-case proj ect assessment will always be insufﬁcient to
assess the true impacts. In the meantime, if the proj ect is to proceed, then every effort must be
taken to coordinate the proj ect with conservation planning efforts.

b. Eastern Scotian Shelf Integgated Management Initiative (ESSIM)

The EA Report states that “The ESSIM Plan is not yet at the stage of identifying ocean
use zones or a marine protected areas system plan, but it is likely that such provisions will be
introduced in the future” (7-47). The recommended action would be not to proceed with large-
scale development and/or resource exploitation activities such as the Deep Panuke Proj ect until
such time as zoning is completed and a marine protected areas system plan is laid out. This will
ensure that the proj ect does not conﬂict unduly with other ocean users or interests, nor constitute
an obstacle in developing the most appropriate zoning options. Proceeding with development
prior to the establishment of a broader integrated management plan could result in future conﬂicts
or other undesirable impacts.

Similarly, the EA Report indicates that the EBSA program, though not yet completed,
hasn’t identiﬁed any conservation initiatives on the Scotian Shelf that would interact with the
Project. Again, following the precautionary approach would warrant waiting until the EB SA
program is completed to ensure that the Proj ect would not pose a risk to any EBSAs that may be
identiﬁed in or near the Proj ect area.

Furthermore, the intent of the ESSIM process is to establish an area-based management
approach where all ocean uses and values and the potential interactions between them can be
considered through proactive planning and management strategies, in contrast to traditional
sector—based management that proceeds on a more ad hoc, case-by-case basis. In this sense,
proceeding with the development of the Deep Panuke Proj ect before this framework can be
established does not reﬂect the goals and obj ectives of the ESSIM process. Instead, this

o
QQPAWé 11
constitutes a business-as-usual approach, rather than making real efforts to coordinate Proj ect
development Within the parameters of a broader, multi-sector strategy.
III. The marine environment

a. Produced water

In the currently proposed Proj ect, there will be greater volumes of produced water
discharged than in the 2002 Deep Panuke Proj ect. As noted in the EA Report, some research
has raised concerns about the impacts of alkylphenols in produced water. These compounds
have been shown to act as hormone mimics, and thus impact the growth and reproductive
success of marine ﬁsh and invertebrates. Modeling of produced water discharge distributions
and concentrations for the proj ect has shown that there should not be signiﬁcant impacts
associated with this. However, there is as yet a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the effects
of produced water. It should be recalled as well that an area in the Vicinity of the proj ect has
been identiﬁed through a WWF/CLF study as being a priority conservation area (CLF and
WWF 2006). In part, this is because it has been identiﬁed as including potential spawning areas
for haddock, yellowtail ﬂounder and silver hake (CLF and WWF 2006:173). Given that the
planktonic life stages of ﬁshes are more sensitive than adults to contaminants such as those
present in produced water discharges, this could be a concern. If there could in fact be
spawning areas in the Proj ect Vicinity, the potential impacts of the produced water discharged
could be more signiﬁcant than anticipated. Given that marine ﬁsh are a VEC, this matter merits
closer analysis. At the very least, vigilant monitoring of the dispersal patterns and impacts of
produced water, as well as an examination of the potential for spawning areas in the Vicinity of
the Project, must be carried out.

The EA Report also states:

One area of new research has focused on the potential impact of produced water on the

. benthos. These studies are at the forefront of research With respect to produced water and

potential impacts to the marine environment (Lee 2003; Lee et a1. 2003; Muschenheim et

al. 2003; Lee et al. 2005; Khelifa et a1. 2005). (8—57)
Another new area of research mentioned that is related to the impacts of produced water has to do
with the formation of a micro-layer on the ocean’s surface containing potentially toxic. metals (8—
73). EnCana must continue to remain aware of this and other similar research and its outcomes,
and in light of this research, to monitor the potential impacts of produced water from the Proj ect.
Mitigation measures or Project modiﬁcations should be made as necessary, depending on the
outcomes and recommendations of this research.

b. Drilling muds and cuttings

Drilling muds and cuttings that will be discharged from the Proj ect also contain small
amounts of toxic substances. Moreover, the new Project conﬁguration will result in muds and
cuttings being diSpersed over a larger total area. As stated in the EA Report, the discharged muds

I7
@QPAVQ 12
and cuttings are most likely to affect demersal ﬁshes because they will settle on the seaﬂoor or
remain in the benthic boundary layer (8-71). As stated above, an area in the vicinity of the Project
has been identiﬁed as a possible spawning area for some species of demersal ﬁsh, including
haddock and yellowtail ﬂounder (CLF and WWF 2006:17 3). Potential impacts of these
discharges on spawning success and recruitment levels must be carefully analysed. If the Project
goes ahead as planned, monitoring of potential impacts of this nature must be carried out and
mitigative or avoidance measures taken where appropriate.

0. Evaluation of gas reserves as an ecosystem component

Throughout the EA Report, no mention is made of the value of the natural gas itself as a
component of the ecosystem, or potential impacts of removing it from the ecosystem. Analyzing
the possible impacts of removing large quantities of natural gas from beneath the ocean ﬂoor
should be a part of the assessment of offshore gas projects such as Deep Panuke.

The EA Report states that “there are no known biologic communities associated with
authigenic-carbonates in the Study Area, nor are there any known areas that could potentially
support such communities” (5-11). However, it does not discuss what, if any, research has
actually been done on the possibility for such communities to exist in this area. Many areas of the
Scotian Shelf remain under-studied, and much is not yet known about the habitats and
communities that exist there. A discussion should be provided of what is known of the possibility
for gas seep-associated communities in the Scotian Shelf region.

d. Seascapes

The WWF and CLF report mentioned above also indicates that one of the notable
characteristics of the priority conservation area in the Vicinity of the Proj ect (priority area #24) is
that it provides representation of seven different benthic seascape types (2006: 1 73). Moreover, it
was the only area identiﬁed for protection that provides representation of two of those seascapes.
Given that this area has been identiﬁed as the best opportunity to provide protection to these two
seascape types, it would be highly unadvisable to bring about any disturbance or destruction of
these seascapes. The impacts that drilling, the laying of pipelines and ﬂowlines, and other Proj ect
activities could have on the benthos and the seascape in general should be re-evaluated based on
this context of regional importance.

e. Winter Skate

Winter skate is a Species at risk. The EA Report states that they may spawn on the Sable
Island Bank, although their spawning habits are not well known (8-72). Following the
precautionary principle, lack of knowledge should not be used as an excuse for inaction. It should
not be assumed that the Proj ect would not affect the winter skate. A winter skate research
program and/or a monitoring program in the vicinity of the Proj ect could be useful and would
help to ensure low impacts on this species at risk.

f. Impacts of industrial development in the Goldboro area on wilderness and wildlife

The EA Report states “the Proj ect will result in a higher level of road use in the Industrial
Park area and along Highway 316 during the construction phase. The Municipality has indicated
that Highway 316 may be re-routed to accommodate use of the industrial park” (9-2). Given that
the development of this Proj ect could be a signiﬁcant factor in requiring the re-routing of the
highway, impacts of highway re-routing must be considered as impacts resulting from this
Proj ect. The building of new roads can have signiﬁcant impacts on wilderness and wildlife. It can
result in habitat fragmentation, increased mortality of some species due to vehicle strikes,
inﬂuxes of invasive species, increased access for hunters and ﬁshers, and other types of pressures
and environmental degradation (CPAWS Wildlands League 2006). If this Project may require the
building of new roadways, this may have important impacts that need to be considered and
properly assessed.

g. Monitoring

In Table 5.2 in the EA Report, in response to a request for an EnCana—funded independent
environmental monitoring program, EnCana states that it Will develop the offshore EEMP in
collaboration with key regulatory agencies led by the CNSOPB (5-11). This doesn’t address the
desire for more independent monitoring and assessment. Offshore oil and gas environmental
monitoring programs could be considered both more trustworthy and more useful if there were
opportunities for involvement of and access to/use of results by academics, ﬁshers, ENGOs, etc.

IV. Public Consultation and Involvement

Although EnCana did make efforts to involve a variety of stakeholder groups in the EA
process and to provide information on the Proj ect to the public, as outlined in section 5 of the EA
Report, involvement in the EA process for this Proj ect has remained a fairly onerous task. The
public involvement process is complicated for those who are not intimately familiar with it. The
involvement of a number of agencies, all with some information on the Proj ect on their websites
(i.e., the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency, the Canada Nova Scotia Offshore
Petroleum Board, and the Review Secretariat itself) created some confusion in terms of knowing
where to ﬁnd all the necessary information on the Proj ect. Information on the project and the
process was presented in a very formal and technical manner, which can be intimidating for the
maj ority of the public who is not familiar with offshore oil development proj ects or the EA
process for such proj ects, but Who may have some concerns or interest in the Proj ect and its
possible impacts and outcomes. Participating in the EA process can be frustrating, ﬁrstly, because
analysing the documents is a time- and resource—intensive process. Secondly, the impression
created is that little will be accomplished through participation in the process. That is, it is
doubtful that any signiﬁcant concessions will be made based on the concerns and requests of the
groups involved. A more effective and successful process would better facilitate all levels of
public participation, making it more feasible from a capacity perspective and more hassle-free.
The agencies involved also need to be more welcoming of public comments, and make more
effort to take serious account of them. This will prevent groups and individuals from becoming

’7’, 1 4
«§§ng {
NOVASCIDTIACHAPTIR
disillusioned with the process. Public participation is a very important and necessary aspect of the
environmental assessment process, but it cannot be effective if no one, or very few, are actually
able or Willing to participate. .

Introduction

The Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS) is a national registered charity
founded in 1963. It has 13 chapters and 20,000 members across Canada, including the Nova
Scotia chapter (CPAWS-NS), incorporated in 1999. CPAWS works to ensure that nature comes
ﬁrst in the management of parks and protected areas, that additional protected areas are created,
and that Canada's biodiversity and wilderness are retained both on land and at sea. The society
achieves this through a combination of education, research, and advocacy. CPAWS works
cooperatively with other conservation-oriented groups, governments, First Nations, and
individual Canadians.

The Atlantic Ocean Committee of CPAWS-NS is working to secure the ecological
integrity of the marine environment of Nova Scotia by actions such as identifying unique and
sensitive marine sites to promote for protection, and raising awareness of the need for and
purpose of marine protected areas. The Committee also encourages government agencies to
follow through on policy and other legal commitments regarding protection and conservation of
the marine environment, such as Canada’s commitment to create a system of marine protected
areas.

The interests of CPAWS-NS in the Deep Panuke Offshore Gas Development Proj ect are:
ﬁrst, to examine the potential impacts of the Proj ect on existing protected areas in the vicinity;
second, to examine how this development could impact the establishment of future protected
areas, as well as protected areas network planning; lastly, to examine the potential impacts of the
Proj ect on marine wilderness and wildlife in general within and surrounding the Proj ect area. In
addition, some comments are made on the public involvement process for the Deep Panuke
Proj ect environmental assessment. '

1. Existing protected areas in the vicinity of the proj ect

a. The Gull}: Marine Protected Area

The Environmental Assessment (EA) Report for the Deep Panuke Offshore Gas
Development Project (the Proj ect) states that an Environmental Protection Plan (EPP) Will be
developed once the Proj ect design is ﬁnalized. At present, the only protection offered the Gully
MPA is the commitment made in the Code of Practice for the Gully Marine Protected Area not to
conduct any activities within the MPA boundaries. It is important that EnCana commit to a robust
monitoring program in the Vicinity of its operations to test air and water quality levels and
dispersal patterns of Proj ect emissions, as well as bio/ecological effects. This information will be
necessary in the environmental management of the Proj ect, and could also act as an early warning
system of any emissions that could affect the Gully, its inhabitants, or its environs. This
environmental data should be made available to individuals and organizations With an interest in
environmental quality and monitoring.

Such monitoring efforts are of growing importance, as Exxon-Mobil Canada is
discontinuing its monitoring stations near the Gully’s border. Vigilant monitoring of all
developments on the Scotian Shelf, along with prompt action where necessary, stringent

x,
Qig£$W§ 4
mitigation measures in place from the start, and a striving for ever higher environmental
standards, will help to conﬁrm and minimize the extent and severity of effects from oil and gas
development in the region. This will be critical for the success of both current and future
protected areas.

Further, it is to be expected that it will not be possible to develop a detailed and effective
EPP until the details of the Proj ect are ﬁnalized. However, this does not give much assurance to
stakeholders that their concerns will be adequately and appropriately addressed. It is stated in the
EA Report that the EFF “will be developed in consultation With the applicable regulatory
agencies to ensure that their concerns are addressed in the planning process” (4—1), and that “key
stakeholders” (4-6) will also be consulted. It is not clear Who will be considered a ‘key
stakeholder’, or how these stakeholders will be selected. There should instead be opportunities
for open public comment from any interested individual or organization during the development
stages of these plans.

The EA Report acknowledges that the endangered status of the northern bottlenose Whale
is due to the threats posed by oil and gas development in the area around the Gully, and that little
information is in fact available as to how such developments may affect this species (7-10). In
particular, marine noise from oil and gas development activities can negatively affect marine
mammals such as the northern bottlenose Whale. Nonetheless, the report concludes that the
distance of the Proj ect from the Gully will minimize the possibility for impacts on the whales.
However, little is known about what the cumulative effects of noise and other impacts from oil
and gas development in the Scotian Shelf region could be, and in particular, little is known of the
possible cumulative effects on the behaviour and health of the endangered northern bottlenose
whale. A broader perspective must be taken here. For instance, each new development on the
Scotian Shelf must be considered to impact cumulatively on the noise levels in this marine
region, and thus the impacts of each proj ect on the whole region must be seriously and
comprehensively examined. In the absence of a plan that sets out limits on factors such as total
allowable development or total allowable noise levels for the region, each additional proj ect must
be considered as adding to a total noise level, Which should then be reassessed as to its potential
impacts. The precautionary principle must be followed. We cannot assume that this Proj ect Will
have no impact on the Gullly and its resident population of endangered northern bottlenose
whales, not to mention other species in the Vicinity. At the very least, careful monitoring and
mitigation of noise levels at all stages of the Project will be necessary.

The EA Report also states that due to the distance of the proj ect from the Gully as well as
adherence to the Code of Practice for the Gully MPA, there are not likely to be any impacts of the
Proj ect on the Gully. Appropriate monitoring of the Proj ect Will be necessary to ensure that this is
the case.

In addition, the EA Report indicates that, according to the oil spill traj ectory modeling
that was done, it is very unlikely that accidental releases of condensate or oil would reach the
Gully. Given the importance and sensitivity of this protected area, a spill response plan should be
put in place nonetheless to address this situation in the case that it should occur.

b. Sable Island

As stated above, the EA Report for the Deep Panuke Proj ect indicates that an
Environmental Protection Plan (EPP) will be developed once the Proj ect design is ﬁnalized. At
present, the only protection offered Sable Island is the commitment made in the Code of Practice
for Sable Island not to conduct any activities within 2 km of the Island. As the EFF is developed,
there should be opportunities for public comment as well as consultation with regulatory
agencies, to ensure that the concerns of stakeholders are adequately and appropriately addressed.

The EA Report states that both air quality and spill modeling for accidental events
indicates that threats to and impacts on Sable Island and receptors on Sable Island would not be
signiﬁcant. It is important that EnCana commit to a robust monitoring program in the vicinity of
its operations to test air and water quality levels and dispersal patterns of Proj ect emissions, as
well as bio/ecological effects. This information will be necessary in the environmental
management of the Proj ect, and could also act as an early warning system of any emissions that
could affect Sable Island, its inhabitants, or its environs. This environmean data should be made
available to individuals and organizations with an interest in environmental quality and
monitoring. It Will also be important that EnCana collaborate With the ongoing monitoring efforts
on Sable Island, and lend its support to these monitoring efforts. It may be appropriate to
collaborate on the deve10pment of monitoring programs on Sable Island to ensure that they will
be effective speciﬁcally for monitoring emissions from the Deep Panuke Proj ect. Regular
communications With the Sable Island monitoring station will allow EnCana to keep abreast of
monitoring results and Will enable it to manage its operations accordingly and ensure the
effectiveness of the monitoring regime, as well as the environmental management of the Proj ect.

The EA Report mentions the Sable Island Air Monitoring Station. However, it does not
elaborate on the role and ﬁmction of the Station. More information should be provided on the
nature of the monitoring that is carried out by this Station, and what information this will provide
with regard to emissions from the Deep Panuke Proj ect.

According to the EA Report, it is not expected that any receptors on Sable Island itself
would be at risk from any accidental releases from the Proj ect. However, the Report does not
address the possibility of impacts on receptors that move between the Island and the surrounding
marine environment, and the possible extent and likelihood of such impacts. For example, what
could be the impacts on Sable Island, its ecosystems, and the populations that make use of the
Island’s habitats if a release were to interact with seals or seabirds at sea that also inhabit the
island? Or what is the possibility that an accidental release could affect ﬁsh or other marine
organisms in the Vicinity that typically would be fed upon by Sable Island’s seal and seabird
populations? Broader ecosystem considerations such as these, rather than analyses of individual
species and speciﬁc locations in isolation, will provide a more accurate impacts scenario for
possible accidents or malfunctions of the Proj ect and thus should be examined.

Sable Island is considered critical habitat for the endangered roseate tern. These birds feed
on small ﬁsh and have been found to hunt for food as far as 20km from their colony (HWW
2007). This means that individuals nesting 0n Sable Island may occasionally be found
signiﬁcantly closer to the Proj ect area, which is located 48km from Sable Island. Monitoring for
this species should be done, and response plans for accidents and malfunctions must take into

’7
QQPAVQ 6
account the possible presence of individuals of this species within about 28km of the Project.
Given the endangered status of this species, losses even of individuals would be a signiﬁcant
impact.

Also, there must be a spill response plan in place to address the possibility of an
accidental release from the Proj ect that threatened to enter the vicinity of Sable Island.

The EA Report states the following regarding oil and gas activity in the Scotian Shelf
region:

As of the end of May 2006, 204 wells had been drilled in the offshore of Nova Scotia

since 1967 (CNSOPB 2006). In addition to seismic and drilling programs, SOEP

continues to operate offshore natural gas facilities south of Sable Island which include
central processing, wellhead, and compression platforms (Thebaud) and several
unmanned satellite platforms (Venture, South Venture, North Triumph, Alma) connected
to the Thebaud complex by interﬁeld ﬂowlines. A 660 mm [26 inch] export pipeline

extends from Thebaud to the SOEP gas plant in Goldboro, N.S. (7-46)

And yet, the conclusion is that “the cumulative environmental effects of the Proj ect in
combination With other projects or activities that may effect, or are currently effecting, Sable
Island are considered not signiﬁcant” (2002 CSR, 6-181). As the Sable Island Bank continues to
be developed by oil and gas interests, this increasing industrial activity increases the risk of
impacts on Sable Island. In the absence of an overarching plan to manage such developments en
masse, or a clear knowledge of what limits and restrictions need to be in place in order to ensure
the protection of Sable Island, its ecosystems and inhabitants, a precautionary approach must be
taken. At the very least, thorough environmental monitoring must be undertaken and high
environmental standards must be upheld during all stages of exploration, construction, operation,
and decOmmissioning. .

The EA Report states that the ﬂaring of acid gas during an accidental event or

malfunction could lead to a maximum ground level concentration of $02 on Sable Island of

' approximately 0.001 mg/m3 . According to the Report, this level of $02 is not expected to
signiﬁcantly impact plants or animals on Sable Island. It should be speciﬁed what “non-
signiﬁcant” (e.g. sub~lethal or otherwise) impacts could result from such levels of 802. For
example, is it possible that impacts could occur if organisms were exposed to these levels of 802
at vulnerable life stages? If such an event were to occur during the nesting season of the
endangered roseate tern or another species, would this possibly affect the health, normal
development, or survival rate of the hatchlings? Further, when 802 combines with water, it forms
sulfuric acid. Would these levels of SO; potentially affect the freshwater ponds on Sable Island?
What about the coastal waters that surround Sable Island? Not enough information is provided in
the EA Report on the possible sub-lethal or environmental effects of these SO; levels.

The EA Report also states that a subsea or surface blowout of a production well or subsea
blowout of the acid gas inj ection well could result in levels of HgS on Sable Island that exceed
permissible levels, although they would not be high enough to result in wildlife mortality. The
2002 CSR also states that “birds are more sensitive than mammals to the effects of low levels of
H28 exposure” (6«1 53). What effects could occur from such an event on the endangered roseate

or
tern, particularly if it were to occur While eggs or young were present on Sable Island? Are there
other sub-lethal effects that such concentration of HZS could have on plants, animals, freshwater
environments, or other ecological aspects of Sable Island? The EA Report does not provide a
sufﬁciently comprehensive discussion of the possible impacts of such accidental events on Sable
Island and the surrounding marine environment.

c. The Haddock Box a

The EA Report states that the Proj ect is not expected to interact with the Haddock Box,
which is located 49km west of the Proj ect. However, Sable Island is located approximately the
same distance away (48km east of the Proj ect), and modeling and a more detailed analysis of the
potential for interaction with the Island due to various emissions and accidental discharges from
the Proj ect are carried out. Given that both Sable Island and marine ﬁsh are identiﬁed as VECs,
and that the Haddock Box is an important area for a commercial species of marine ﬁsh that is
currently generally in a depleted state (as well as other species), the lack of attention paid to the
Haddock Box is inappropriate. Moreover, part of the explanation given in the EA Report for Why
there is not likely to be any impact on Sable Island from accidental releases of diesel or other
harmful substances is because “prevailing water currents would take the dispersed condensate
cloud in a southwest direction away from Sable Island” (3-9). This is potentially a concern given
that the Haddock Box is located in a southwesterly direction from the Proj ect, Which suggests
that currents could carry harmful substances released from the Proj ect into this area.

It is inadequate to dismiss the possibility of effects of the Proj ect on the Haddock Box
simply because of the distance that separates them. The potential for interactions must be
examined and elaborated more fully. If there is in fact a low likelihood of interaction, then a more
detailed analysis of why this is the case must be provided.

d. Country Island

As the EFF is developed, there should be opportunities for public comment as well as
consultation with regulatory agencies to ensure that the concerns of stakeholders are adequately
and appropriately addressed. Further, it is important that EnCana commit to a robust monitoring
program in the Vicinity of its operations to test air and water quality levels and dispersal patterns
of Project emissions, as well as bio/ecological effects. This information Will be necessary in the
environmental management of the Proj ect, and could also act as an early warning system of any
emissions that could affect Country Island, its inhabitants, or its environs. This environmental
data should be made available to individuals and organizations with an interest in environmental
quality and monitoring. Careful monitoring and maintenance of the pipeline to Goldboro will be
particularly important in the case of Country Island.

The EA Report indicates that modelling shows that it is very unlikely that condensate
from a blowout or oil from platform spills would reach Country Island. However, it is the
pipeline to Goldboro that would be nearest to Country Island, and there appears to be no
modelling or analysis of the potential fate of condensate or other materials that could be released
through an accident or malfunction in the pipeline near Country Island. In the modelling of

.47
QQPAW§ 8
effects from failure of the SOEP option pipeline, it is estimated that the condensate could travel
up to 5.5km. If a condensate cloud released from the pipeline near Country Island travelled that
far, it could reach Country Island. If there is a possibility that there could be an accidental release
from the pipeline near Country Island, then the impacts of this must be examined. If such an
occurrence is unlikely to occur, then an explanation of Why this is the case should be provided.

Although no nearshore pipeline construction is to occur between April 19 and J une 20,
which covers the period When the endangered roseate tern typically prospects for nests and lays
eggs on Country Island, checks should be made before the commencement of as well as during
construction activity to ensure that this is in fact the case. If after J une 20 there may still be some
possibility of disturbing roseate tern activity on Country Island, construction must be postponed.
Likewise, if there is any tern nesting activity on the Island prior to April 19, construction activity
must be halted in advance of this date. Monitoring of the tern colony must also be carried out
throughout the construction period, and if any disturbance appears to be resulting, construction
must be halted until a suitable solution is found. The EA Report states that the EEMP for the
Proj ect will include a monitoring program for the roseate tern. There should be an opportunity for
comment on this program from the public as well as from relevant organizations and agencies
(e.g. Canadian Wildlife Service, Bird Studies Canada, Roseate Tern Recovery Team, etc).

Although no foraging grounds for the roseate tern have been identiﬁed near the pipeline
landfall area, monitoring must be done to ensure that this is the case, and any possible interaction
with foraging grounds that is identiﬁed must be immediately and appropriately remedied.

Even though construction of the SOEP option export pipeline Will eliminate the need to
construct a new pipeline in the Vicinity of Country Island and its population of endangered
roseate terns, the SOEP pipeline itself remains in this Vicinity. Since EnCana will be using this
pipeline to transport its product to shore, it must still take some responsibility in the case that
there should be an accident or malfunction resulting in a release from the SOEP pipeline. Any
potential impacts on Country Island and the roseate terns due to accidents or malfunctions of the
SOEP pipeline should also be considered to be impacts associated with this Proj ect, as the Deep
Panuke Proj ect Will result in increased use of the pipeline to transport gas to shore.

II. Protected areas network planning and estabiishment

a. Protected areas planning

While the EA Report addresses the potential for impacts on existing protected areas in the
vicinity of the Proj ect, existing marine protected areas by no means yet constitute an adequate
level of protection for the Scotian Shelf marine region, or a completed protected areas network.
Much more remains to be done to safeguard the health and biodiversity of our oceans, and
Canada’s federal government has indeed committed to doing more. Canada’s Oceans Act (1996)
requires the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to establish a system of marine protected areas
(MPAS) in Canada. Canada has also committed to a number of international agreements with a
goal of establishing a network of marine protected areas by 2012, including the Convention on
Biological Diversity, and agreements reached at the World Summit on Sustainable Development.
Because of such legislated goals and commitments, it is necessary that the assessment of this

7.4.4.1 Land and Water Use .

i Construction of the pipeline from landfall to the tie~in with the M&NP main natural gas ummnission
line has the potential to disrupt land and water use. Those most directly impacted would include the
land owners, or users, and the municipality.

’ 11) Analysis
' As indicated in Section 4.4.1.4, the routing of the pipeline from landfall to the tie-in location is

. largely through lands that have been disturbed in the recent past, or are grown aver with alder scrub.
No active logging is takintg place on any of these lands. As depicted on Fign‘e 4.15, the GCRDA, in
association with the Municipality, has designated and acquired 600 acres of land adjacent to the

' SOEI gas plant for the Goldboro Industrial Park. The preposed tight-of-way for the pipeline crosses
this area. The ﬁnal routing will be negotiated with the municipality to ensure minimal disruption to
potential industrial development sites. .
Altheug there are no active 111139131. workin s in the 'cini of the ' line eonidor, there
~ are lands subject to minty! licenses see Figure 4. ' ' ‘ ‘ that extends...
_.. .. across the proposed ipeline conidor. Access through all lands will have: otiated wi the _

7.4.4.2 First Nations’ Land & Water Use
As indicated in Section 4.4-1.1, there is evidence that the Mi’lunaq historically ﬁequented areas in

, the vicinity of Country and Isaac’s harbours. Further, as referenced in Section 4.3.2.4, First Nations’
peoples have acquired licenses to ﬁsh in the nearshore and offshore waters, including licenses to ﬁsh
in waters in proximity to the pipeline and its landfall. Consideration of eﬂ‘eets, if any, on such .
eommercial licenses are addressed in Sections 7.4.1.6 and 7.5.1.6, which address the Project’s
unpact on the inshore and offshore ﬁsheries respectively. ‘

Halifax, NS . ‘
. B3] 3N6 ‘ JAN 2 9 2007
. Dear Deep Panuke Public Review Secretariat, ﬂfgtﬁcsqéﬁéﬁg
' Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the environmental assessment (BA) for the
proposed Deep Panuke offshore gas development proj ect submitted by Encana in November
2006. a
In 2001 , WWF-Canada opened the Atlantic Region Ofﬁce in Halifax to advance its conservation
obj ectives in the Northwest Atlantic Marine Ecoregion. Our ultimate goal in the ecoregion is to
conServe the full range of biodiversity, restore ecosystem health, and ensure resource use is
sustainable. Our immediate priorities include protecting habitat through representative networks
of marine protected areas (MPAs) and working toward sustainable ﬁsheries by reducing
excessive bycatch. We are also continually working with government and stakeholders to help
make the transition from single-species and sector—based management approaches to a more
proactive, integrated, and ecosystem-based approach throughout the ecoregion.
After reviewing the EA, WWF-Canada has serious concerns regarding the overall process and
the potential impacts of the proposed proj ect on marine species, habitats and ecosystems. Our
maj or concerns are presented below.
Major industrial development should not precede ocean use and conservation gianning
The proposed prOj ect illustrates the need for large-scale conservation planning for Nova Scotia
waters. Systematically assessing the conservation needs of a region will identify sensitive
habitats and species and give decision makers an opportunity to implement necessary protection
, measures prior to any new industrial development. As stated in the EA, the Eastern Scotian Shelf
Integrated Management (ES SIM) initiative is well underway and an Integrated Management
(1M) Plan has been developed for a broader area that encompasses the proposed proj ect. The
conservation planning aspects of BS SIM include the identiﬁcation of Ecologically and
Biologically Signiﬁcant Areas (EBSAS), which are ecOlogically important areas that may require
special management attention. Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) will propose a preliminary
list of EBSAs in March 2007. A study by WWF-Canada, in partnership with the Conservation
Law Foundation (CLF and WWF-Canada, 2006), determined that the proposed proj ect location
overlaps with an area that exhibits important ecological characteristics that suggest it will qualify
as an EBSA for reasons including its persistent high primary productivity, high demersal ﬁsh
diversity, and importance to groundﬁsh during vulnerable life stages (see below).

This maj or industrial development has the potential to do serious damage to the communities of
Sable Island Bank and therefore should not proceed prior to a more comprehensive assessment of
conservation needs and the implementation of necessary management measures — both of which
will be accomplished through ESSIM. .
. As partners in ES SIM and stewards of the ESSIM plan, the offshore energy industry, the i a
. regulatory agency and the federal government (along with WWF-Canada and a range of other
oceans stakeholders) have all expressed a commitment to the approach and objectives of the
' ESSIM plan. ‘As such, there is an onus on us as stakeholders to make decisions in accordance
. with the spirit of the plan. 0
Networks of marine protected areas (MPAs) are now recognized as perhaps the most effective
' tool for protecting sensitive marine habitats and species, and will be a foundational tool for '
achieving the objectives set out in the ESSIM plan. WWF-Canada believes that sensitive or
unique areas as well as representative areas should be protected through regional-scale networks.
Canada has committed to establishing MPA networks throughout its waters by 2012. Protecting
important habitats and Species through a systematic planning process would illustrate proper
application of the precautionary approach and be consistent with WWF-Canada’s Conservation
F z'rst principle, Which requires that conservation steps be sequenced in advance of development
while options still exist.
The proposed project location is an imgortant area for larval and juvenile ﬁshes
The EA did not recognize and adequately address the importance of the proposed proj ect site to
groundﬁsh on the eastern Scotian Shelf.
The location falls with the gyre that occurs on the western half of Sable Island Bank. This area is
known as the larval retention zone and has the highest diversity of larval ﬁsh in the Scotia-Fundy
region (Shackell and Frank 2000). The impacts of the noise and discharges from offshore gas
development on larval ﬁsh are not well know so this project could have a signiﬁcant impact on
the overall health of the already severely altered eastern Scotian Shelf ecosystem. ‘
The proposed proj ect site is also an important nursery area for haddock and the depleted eastern
Scotian Shelf population of cod. Both of these are important commercial species that are
currently under moratoria. An analysis of DFO trawl survey data indicate that the proposed
proj ect location overlaps with the area of highest juvenile haddock abundance on the eastern
Scotian Shelf (King 2004). J uvenile cod are also abundant in this area.
In summary, our major concerns regarding this project are:
0 That it is preceding prior to the identiﬁcation of EBSAs and the implementation of the
ESSIM Plan; and
o The EA did not recognize the potentially signiﬁcant impacts of this development on the
groundﬁsh communities — that include ecologically and economically important species,
such as cod and haddock — of the eastern Scotian Shelf.
We recommend that the proposed proj ect should not proceed prior to implementation of the
conservation planning aspects of the ESSIM Plan.

questions regarding our submission or would like to discuss our concerns with this proposed
proj ect.

Mineral Rights Objections ‘
' 3.1 Objections by Holders of Mineral Exploration Licences ‘
The Board received objections to SOEI’s demiied route from two holders of Mineral Exploration
Licences (the 'Iicenees“) issued by the Nova Seotie Department of Natural Resources (the "DNR");
The Board considered these objections in hearings held in Halifax, Nova Scotia on 11 and 12 August ‘
1998. '
3.2 General Board Comments with res eet to Holders Mine 1
, Exploration Licences
“MH—
A number of facts detettmn‘ ed in these two hearings are common to both of the objections. ~
. SOEI did not consult with the holders of the Licences d ' the course 0 ' '1
route selection process.
.-—-—--—""'*—‘
'- The Licences, which give the holders the right to search and prospect for minerals and to
apply for a mining lease within the areas desMhed by the Licences, .are valid and in good
standing. .
- A Licence, by its terms, was issued and is held subject to the rights of the owner, occupant
or tenant of the land covered by the Licence and to the provisions of the relevant
provincial laws.
- One of the important requirements applicable to the Licences is that, prior to carrying out
any exploration activities, the holders must ebtein permission fer surface access from the
DNR. By letter dated 7 August 1998, counsel for Sable Offshore Energy Inc. was advised
. ' by Rosalind C. Penfound, Executive Director, Land Services Branch of the DNR. that the
local DNR ofﬁce for the Guysborough area had been advised "that sm'faee access for
mineral exploration on Crown land should not be given for any lands . . . in pespeet of
' Which certiﬁcates have been issmed by the National Energy Board ” The 7 August
letter did not uplinitiy describe the Licences affected by this direction; nor was there any
reference to the proposed detailed route of the pipeline.
- No specific applications have been made for sm'faee access by any of the affected Licence
holders; and, accordingly, there was no evidence in these proceedings that either of those
Licence holders has been denied surface aeeees.
The provincial Crown has the authority to deny surface access to a Licence holder upon application, or
to revoke the Lieences, thereby eﬁeetively extinguishing the rights of the Licence holders to object to
the detailed route of the pipeh’ne. There was, however, no evidence that any of these actions had been
7% 1 taken by the DNR in respect of any of the Licences held by the ohjeeters in these proceedings. In the
' Board’s view, unless and until such deﬁnitive actions are taken, the interests of the Licence holders,

- while dependent on and related to the provincial Crown (or mineral owner) and surface tights owners, '
h _ f2_nh...me@tws that, in the context of determining a detailed route under the ACI, may not be

adequately addressed throu contact only with mineral and surface rights owners.

3 With respect to these objections, the Board is of the view that the failure to consult early in the

' ' ”‘7‘ ”W
' plannmg process mth holders of Lteences puts into WW

route selection procesat. S eciﬁcall MW
in the route selection process could hggeresulted in a different lied- or eta: ed route.

_ MM
Be that as it may, the Board must now consider whether the respective detailed routes for which
approvals are requested are the best possible detailed routes, having regard to all relevant factors,
including the comparative merits of any preposed eltematives and the interests of the Licence holders.

f_____________._.—.
3.3 Speciﬁc Mineral Rights Cases
The objections for which a hearm' g was held are smearized below and appear in the order in which
they were heard by the Boatd.
3.3.1 Kevin McAllister
, f"—""'ES= :
Description of Proposed Route (PPBOR Sheet 1)
Mr. Kevin MeAllister holds three Licences issued under the Nova Scotia Mineral Resources Act in the ,
vicinity of the pipeline landfall: at Ragged Point, Ragged Rock and at Dung Cove. The offshore
approaeh and proposed onshore route would haverse the Dung Cove Licence area, which spans the
’ width of the 500 m wide corridor. .

' The onshore portion of the SOEI’s proposed detailed pipeline route starts at landfall in Isaaes Harbour.
approximately 3 km southeast of the village of Goldboro, in Guyshorough County, NS. The detailed
route then proceeds in a northeast direction.

SOEI identiﬁed two control points for the proposed route: the point of landfall and the gas plant site.
The point of landfall was deternh'ned based on near shore bathymetry and the depth requirements of
the pipe laying vessel, the requirements for a Straight section of pipe at the near shore and landfall
locations, the minimum arc radius of the near share pipe, and avoiding features such as archaeological
sites, recreaﬁtmal‘ dive sites and ﬁsh habitat. Another constraint to the landfall location was the
avoidance of lands where ownership was in question. As the gas plant is already under eenstruetion,
its location is therefore a comm! point for the detailed route.

This portion of the route crosses mixed terrain including immature and mature deciduous forest and
several watercourses including Betty’s Cove Brook and a-wetland area.

Nature of Objection

Mr. MeAllister objected to the proposed route on the basis that the alignment would adversely affect
his. mineral exploration activities. He also objected to the lack of consultation pmvided by SOEI to
him as a Licence holder . ‘
MH-4-98 9

ElleEIKZII? 81:26 982-2?5-3438 FIRST EﬁSTER’N MGMT PAGE 19
With respect to tinting of constructian, SOEI expressed concern that delay of the construction would .
impact the startwup of the overall project and would be prejudicial to the success and feasibility of the

. project. It noted that because Heartland does not have surface access to conduct explomtion and that
' it is not likely to receive surface access pemﬁssion, a delay in tl'te‘construcﬁon is not justiﬁed and
would not resolve issues regarding Heartland’s mineral interests.
’ Heartland argued that SOEI’s consultation process failed to consider the interests of holders of
Licences. ‘ .
SOEI argued that there are no current surface access permits granted to Crown lands in the area of the
proposed route. SOEI submitted that, based on concepondence to SOEI from the DNR, there would
' not be any mntace access granted for mineral exploration on Crown lands in which certiﬁcates have
' been issued by the Board.
80151 stated that the proposed mute was determined having regard for its route selection miteria. The
proposed route would be the shortest possible mute, thereby minimizing surface disturbance,1ength
and cost. It would align with the existing foundations and tie-in point for the slug catcher at the gas
plant site. The proposed route would avoid a property for which the land title is currently under
dispute, and it would further parallel existing property boundaries for much of its length.
Heartland submitted that the alternate route would not be signiﬁcantly longer than the proposed mute.
In addition, the alternate route would still be within the certiﬁcated corridor. The alternate mute
would cause less of an impact on Heartland because it is located in an area that has lower potential for .
exploration than the area of the proposed route.
SOEI argued that Heartland did not take into consideration factors ether than those which would cause
the least impact to Heartland Heartland did not consider the interests of other landowners or that
environmental eonsu-ajnts had been identiﬁed and weighed. SOEI submitted that it had signiﬁcant
eoneerns with the alternate route including: increased length to the pipeline and thereby increased
sm'faee disturbance; two ninety degree bends in the pipe; the crossing of additional lands that are
cmrently not part of the preposed mute; inmased construction costs; construction across side slopes
be5ide Betty’s Cove Brook which would contravene a condition imposed on SOEI by the Nova Scotia
Mister for the Environment; and construction difﬁculties at the control points.
' Views of the Board
m
I The Board notes that Heartland’s Licence area extends across the emm: corridor in this
t a W W W afracedvﬂzerewrthmmikmmm
( ‘ﬂle'eéi‘i'idor.
W
Heartland’s request for a delay in construction to allow it to earn; out its exploration ~
program is at this tithe an open-ended request for delay of the project. Heartland does
not presently have consent for smface access which would make the timing of any
exploration program uncertain. In the Board’s view it would not be appropﬁate te
requtre' SOEI to delay construction in these eucum' stances.

Dear Sirs/Mesdames:

Re: Letter of Comment - Public Review of Encana’s Panuke Offshore Gas Development
Proj ect Hearing GH—2—2006

In accordance With paragraph 4 - "Joint Directions on Precedure - Encana Corporati on — Deep Panuke

Offshore Gas Development" we respectfully provide the following observations and comments, fur the

Secretariat’s review and consideration:

1. By Agreement effective April 3, 2006, Greyhawk Ridge Minerals Inc. ("Greyhawk") acquired
from Heartland Resources Inc. ("Heartland") all of Heartland’s rights and interests, and assumed
all of Heartland’s obligations and liabilities, relating to exploration Licence No. 05867 (formerly
Explomtion Licence No 04094) covering lands on, over or under which we understand EnCana
proposes to construct its on—land pipeline.

2. Licence No. 04094 was issued to a company associated With Heartland, more than twenty~five
years ago, by the Province of Nova Scotia under the Mineral Resources Act ("Act"), and more
than $850,000.00 has been expended in exploration of the lands comprising the Licence since that

. time.

3. . The Act grants unto a licence holder the right to prospect and search for minerals 0n the lands, to
extract minerals f0? test purposes, and to apply for a mining lease for all or a part of the area held
under a licence. Prior to carrying out these activities, a licencee is required to obtain access to the

‘ subject lands. If the landowner does not grant access to the licencce, then pursuant to Section
100 of the Act, a licence holder may apply to the Minister for a surface rights permit to pass over, 0
enter upon, and work such lands. The Minister may grant a surface rights permit upon such tenns
and conditions as the Minister determines. Pursuant to subsection 100(6) of the Act, there is no
appeal from the granting by the Minister of a Surface rights permit.

4. The Minister has never denied surface access to Greyhawk (er Heartland before it) respecting the
1ands held undEI the Licence.

in the route seleetion process could have resulted in a different applied-for detailed route. .

. Be that as it may, the Board must now consider whether the respective detailed routes for which
approvals are requested are the best possible detailed routes, having regard to all relevant factors,
including the comparative merits of any proposed alternatives and the interests of the Licence holders.

Ii 4.3 Speciﬁc Mineral Rights Cases

Ii The mineral rights holders’ objections for which a hearing was held are summarized below and appear

i in the order they were heard by the Board.

g 4.3.1 Orex Exploration Inc.

I Description of Proposed Route (PPBnR Sheet 1)

Orex holds Exploration Licence No. 00502 in the county of Guysborongh, NS on land which spans the
entire width of the approved corridor between KP 2.0 and KP 5.0. '

The proposed route would travel west to avoid a wet area near KP 2.0. After crossing an unnamed
watercourse, the route would proceed towardsthe crossing of the Goldboro Branch Road. The route
would then proceed in a northwesteriy direction to a control point located at K? 4.1 between a
provinciaﬂy-mapped peat wetland and various abandoned drill sites and mine shafts.

' M&NP submitted that the proposed route was determined based on M&N?’s detailed route selection
eriterisL The criteria incorporated the pﬁmary principle of minimizing the overall length of the
pipeline and a number of seemdary principles. The proposed route would avoid wetland areas located
at approximately KP 1.0 and KP 4.5, abandoned drill sites and mine shafts, mining areas, 6016 Emok
Lake (thereby minimizing interference with a Great Blue Heron colony) and Gold Brook. A control
point occurs at KP 6.3, where the easements required for the construction of the natural gas pipeline

' and the NGLs pipeline would diverge.

= Nature of Objection

L Orex submitted that locating the pipeline anywhere along the corridor would prevent Orex from being

! able to undertake an open pit gold mining project.

. - Views of the Parties . '
Heartland indicated that it has held EXpleration Licences in the area since 1981 and has actively
explowd for gold deposits since that time. Heartland stated that it had commissioned a consulting
geologist and a mining engineer and both recommended that exploration be continued on the subject
lands. It believes that the lands alcmg the proposed route hold signiﬁcant potential for the
' development of economic gold deposits and it has identiﬁed several exploration targets in the area.

' Heartland stated that commotion of the pipeline would affect its exploration plans if the construction
occurred before September 1999. It stated that it would be able to complete its planned exploration
activities over the alternate route by this date. Heartland stated that although it has held the ~ -

, Exploration Licence for this area for several years, market conditions and the availability of funds now
favoured commencement of exploration.
M&NP argued that the proposed route reasonably considers active mining and WWW.
being conducted on the land. It stated that Heartlané’s ﬂlmtion activities wouldjothﬁgﬁﬁmggd
. the presence of the Eroposed Bipeline.
M&NP prephred a comparison chart of the proposed versus alternate routes for the pipeline. The
almate would increase the length of the pipeline by about 600 metres, thereby increasing the surface
disturbance and the cost of the pipeline. The alternate mute would also require the crossing of Betty’s
Cove Brook which is located in an area where mine railings are present. It was eoneemed that the
crossing of the brook would release contaminants from the railings. The proposed route, however, did
not cross any brooks. M&NP further assessed factors such as archaeology, raptors, ﬁsh and ﬁsh
habitat, rare odonates, acid rock drainage and mine workings. The factors were either not preSent or
not a concern along the proposed route. The status of these factors for the alternate route was either
not known 0r had high potential for being encountered. In light of the comparisons, M&NP did not
consider the altemate route to be viable.
Heartland did not believe the additional length of the altemate route (i.e. 600 metres) to be signiﬁcant
and noted that the alternate Would still be Within the certiﬁcated con'idor. It believed the alternate
route wmﬂd minimallx hnpact its exploration activities because the alternate would cross areas that are
either not promising for eXploraﬁon or w 1e ave eady been explored.
Heartland was also concerned about the lack of consultation by M&NP. Heartland indicated that it
was not contacted during the route selection praeess and therethre was not given an opportunity to
provide its input into the most appropriate detailed route for the pipeline-

The Board is satisﬁed that the alternate route suggested by Heartland poses potentially
_ serious problems which do not exist on the prapesed route. These include increased
surface disturbance, the crossing of Betty’s Brook with the potential for the release of
cantaminants and the potential for abandoned mhle shafts or old drillin sites.

h ' 5. In 1998, Sable Offshore Energy Inc. ("80131") and Maritimes 8:. Northeast Pipeline Management
‘ Inc. ("M&NP") constructcd natural gas pipelines and related infrastructure on the lands which
‘ comprised Licence No. 04094. In the result, and pursuant to Section 35 of the National Energy
Board Act ("NEE Act"), the National Energy Board ("NEE") convened and held Detailed Route
. Hearings MH-4—98 and MH-3-98 in August, 1998.
h 6. In its Reasons for Decision Hearing Orders MH~4~98 and MI—I-3-98, among other things, the
N133 found:
‘ (a) "..... the intemsts of licence holders, While dependent on and related to the
' . provincial Crown (0r mineral owner) and surface tights owners, fbrm separate
. . I integestg that, in the context of detenuining a detailed route under the Act, may
. not be adequately addressed through contact only with mineral and surface rights
. owners-" [emphasis added] ‘
(b) “The board notes that Heartland’s Licence area extends acress the, entire conidor
in this area, and that its interests would be affected wherever the detaiied
route is located in the corridog.” [emphasis added]
Accordingiy, it is resjudz'cam that the mineral exploration Licence (and related mineral
claims) held by Heartland (and now Greyhawk) are: interests for the purposes of the NEB
Act and that these interests weuid be affected by a pipeline crossing the lands comprising
the Licence.

7. Section 75. Of NEE Act provides:

"Damages and compensation

75 , A company shall, in the exercise of the powers granted by this Act 01' aSpecial Act,
do as little damage as possible, and shall make full compensation in the manner provided
in this Act and in a Special Act, to all persons interested, for all damage sustained by them
by reason of the exercise of those powers.“

8. Notwithstanding the provisions of the NEE Act , that the: NEB determined that Heartland held a
separate interest, and that Heartland’s interest would be affected wherever SOEI’S and M&N'P’s
detailed routes were located in the corridor, SOEI and M&NP have refused to compensate
Greyhawk (and Heartland before it).

9. As Greyhawk advised the Secretariat in its letter dated December 13, 2006, it is apparent that, "if
left to its own desires" (as was the ease with SOEI and M&NP before it), EnCana fully intends to
ignore any damages Gteyhawk and other mineral rights holders may suffer as a reault 0f the
construction and operation of the onshore portion of its pipeline. That this is the case is
evidenced by the fact that, by its letter to the Secretariat dated December 6, 2006, EnCana sought
to have the Secretariat exclude "The potential impact of the construction and operation of the
pipeline on mineral rights holders" as (me of the issues to be examined by the Secretariat in the
Public Review process. ‘

BIEQSHQBB? 131:25 982-275-3438 FIRST EQSTERN MGMT PﬁGE E14
. . 3
10- Greyhawk ﬁnds EnCana’s disposition in this regard most troubling. Not only does the WEB Aer
' . require EnCana to make full compensation to all persons interested, for all damage sustained by ‘
them by reason of the exercise of powers granted under the NEB Act, undertakings to do so are
. commonly given and form a part of the proponents undertaking in NEE and Provincial regulatory ‘
’ hearings regarding pipelines. Some such examples follow;
. ' _ (i) ggH—l—WS (Ecothills 8: Yukon Pipeline} ‘
"Foothills also developed a position on compensatitm. It’s overall philosophy
was that a person adversely affected by its project should be compensated in such
a manner that he is equally as well off after the construction of the pipeline as he ‘
' was initially. As well, the person should not suffer in any way because of any
above-ground facilities constructed by the company, nor should he suffer in any
‘ way should the pipeline cause him damage during operations."
(ii) giﬂ-B—ZOOO (Rick’s Nova Scotia (30.!
"Rick’s stated that it had additional contact with two registered n'appers affected
by the preposed line, namely Mr. Morin and Ms. Rothlisberger and her family".
With respect to Mr. Moﬁn: "Ricks submitted that it would keep him poeted, work
closely with him on this project, and compensate him if what it proposed doing
caused him ﬁnancial harm. "
(iii) OH-Z-SO [htcmrovigcjal Eipeljneg)
"8.2.8.2 Compensation IPL (NW) indicated it would compensate individuals for
losses suffered as a result of construction, Operations or maintenance of the
project."
(iv) GH-4—99 (Maritimes & Eogtheagt Eipeline}
"Nonetheless, the right-of-way affects a total of 363 landowners and interested
garties, and would remove 150 ha of forest from production." To minimize such
losses, all affected woodlot owners would be compensated for their entrant and
' future losses at fair market value. Other general mitigatjve measures proposed to
address land and resource uses include: .
0 provision of fair and reasonable compensation".
(v) GH-6-90 (ﬂestcgasr jgjransmigsignl
"Westeoast testified. that it will deal with hunting and trapping losses resulting ‘
from eonsmction ofthe applied-for facilities. It also testiﬁed that it has an
unqualiﬁed responsibility for damages to third parties resulting from its activities
and for damages resulting from failures along its pipeline system-
View of Interested Parties
The Band believed that, should the Adsett Pipeline be approved, a
condition should be included in the certiﬁcate requiring Westcoast to
provide full compensation for damages suffered by the Band as a result of ‘
the pipeline.

enforeable tngough the courtg, for damages resulting directly from its ‘
mnelme activities and therefore does not propose to so condition a
certiﬁcate, should the facilities be approved" [Emphasis added}
11- Greyhawk understands and acknowledges that detail relating to compensation may be beyond the

mandate of the Secretariat. However, Greyhawk understands that the Secretariat‘s mandate

includes ensuring that all requirements of the NEB Act, including the requirement that a proponent

granted a certiﬁcate and powers under the N83 Ac: make full compensation to all persons ‘

interested, for all damage sustained by them by reason of the exercise of those powers, are ‘

adhered to by the proponent, and that the public interest is served.

12, As the Secretariat correctly notes in its notice to A1] Parties to the Deep Panuke Coordinated
Review Process, dated 18, December, 2006, Greyhawk asks that the Secretariat consider the
potential impact of the construction and operation by EnCana of the pipeline on mineral rights

' holders so that (as was and is the case reapeeting 80131 and M&NP), mineral rights holders will a
not have to Spend eight years+ and resort to the courts, with tens of thousands of dollars of legal

' fees, in an effort to receive fair compensation for the damages they may suffer as a result of

EnCana’s construction and operation of its pipeline.
In our view, it is unrealistic, and ﬁnancially prohibitive for most small, mineral rights holders in
Nova Scotia to have to incur the legal and court costs which flow from the negotiation, ~
arbitration, and appeal provisions under the NEE Act, in an effort to receive fair compensation for
damages they suffer as a result of multi-billion dollar international corporations deliberately
choosing to ignore their Obligation, under the NEE Act, to compensate interested persons who
suffer damage as a resukt of the construction and operation of their pipelines.
Surely, that was not the intent, of Parliament when it drafted the NEE Act, net is it in the public
interest. .

. 13. Absent undertakings and assurances from EnCana to the Secretariat that Bneana will fairly
compensate mineral ﬁghts holders for the damages they may suffer as a result of EnCana’s a
construction and operation of its pipeline, such that they will be equally as well off after the
construction of the pipeline as there were initially, Greyhawk tespectt‘ully asks that the Secretariat
require, as a condition of any certiﬁcate(s) or permit(s) granted EnCana to construct and operate
its pipeline, that EnCana fairly compensate mineral rights holders for the damages they may suffer
as a result of the construction and operation of EnCana’s pipeline.

14. Greyhawk believes that, permitting EnCana to proceed with the construction and operation of its
proposed pipeline without EnCana undertaking and committing that it will fully comply with all
requirements of the NEE Act, including the requirement to make full compensation to all persons
interested, for all damage sustained by them by reason of the exercise of the powers granted
EnCana under the NEB Act , including mineral rights holders, may well result in the Secretariat’s
approval process being invalid.

15. Greyhawk realizes it is possible that persons may have acquired mineral exploration licences since
Encana ﬁrst announced its proposed gas project in 2002, for "opportunistic reasons".

' BIJQEUQBI? 81:25 982-2?5-3438 FIRST E&STER‘N MGMT PAGE BE:
. . Accordingly, Greyhawk believes it appropriate and reasonable that compensation not apply to any
party who acquired mineral rights subsequent to EnCana publicly announcing its pmposcd project
in year 2002. ‘ ' ‘

. Re: Review of Encana Corporation’s Environmental Assessment Report for the
' . ' Deep Panulce Offshore 635 Development Project GH-2-2006 and EnCana ‘5 '
. responses to Environment Canada Information Request No. 1.
I , The-Environmental Assessment (EA) Report appears not toidehtify potential Nova
Scotia Environment and Labour (NSEL) approval requirements. NSEL administers the
_ EA process and issues approvals pursuant to Part IV of the Environment Act (Act), and

issues approvais pursuant to Part V of the Act. '

' The requirement for a Class I provincial EA is based on whether the proposed project ’
' involves either of the foliowihg onshore activities: ‘

1- An onshore pipeline 5 km or more in length, excluding a pipeiine of any length ’ .
carrying natural gas with a maximum operating pressure below 500 peig (3450 <
kPa), water, steam or domestic wastewater. ' ~
The EA Report states that the onshore portidn of the pipeline will be

, approximately 2 to 4 km in length. If this increases to 5 km or more in
length, with 500 psig or more, then a Class 1 EA will be triggered.

2. An enterprise, activity, project or structure or work which disrupts 2 ha or'mere of

‘ ' . any wetland. ,
It is understood. from the EA Report that the final onshore pipeline routing
is still uncertain and therefore the area of impact to wetlands has not yet
been determined. If 2 he or more are to be disrupted! then a Class I EA will
be triggered.

Part V Water Approvals are required to alter a wetland of any size. “Alteration” means

the ﬁlling, draining, flooding or excavating of a wetland. Water Approvals are not

required from NSEL where wettanci'e are located on Federal lands (section 3 (3)

. Activities Designation Regulations) or First Nation lands.
NSEL considers a number of issues such as Specieeat risk, grhundwater, surface
, water, air quality, in any approval. EnCane is required to provide NSEL with the
following information for any wetland alteration:
Wetlands information: . '
o wetland delineation (location, size, boundaries) ‘ '
. maps and photos clearly indicating the location of the proiect, the wetiand and
other natural features ‘
_ 0 description of the wetlands ecological character

Attention Ms.Debi Noye
Dear Ms. Noyc:
Re:      Cross Examination of Wayne Lockerby by Robert Grant obf EnCana Corporation,
         on March 7,2007 - Public Review of Eucnna's Deep Portuke Offshore Cns
                                   -
         Development Projcctm Hearing GH-2-2006
By this letter 1 raise a concern and request, which I respectfully ask that you place before the
Commissioner and the NEB Member.
As you are aware, on the afternoon of March 7,2007, on bellolf of Greyhawk Ridye Minerals
Inc., and in accordance with sections 3. and 5.(1) or the Joim Directions on Procetlure CJDOP"),
I made an Oral Statement to the Comrnissio~~cr    and the NEB Mei~lber.Thereafter. I was
effectively cross-examined by Mr. Robert G~~anl:   on behalf of EnCana.
Section 3. of the JDOP piwides that the Coml'llissioner,the NEB Menlber, Encarla, and any
other party with Imve, will be "dlowed to ask questions of the person making ~e statement"
I raise the matter of what is the scope OK and what are reasonable qucssrions? In m y view,
reasonable questions are questions directly related to nly oral statement. They cennot be far
tanging, unlimited, and ask that I confirm the wording of selected parabgaphs of documents
which I neither authored nor agree with.
In his cross-examination, the nlajority of Mr. Grant's questions of me related to three do cum^,
t h e being: i) the Decision of an Arbitration Commiuee which is presently the subject of an
appeal bcfore the federal court, based on errors offact and of law; ii) a letter from the
                                                                                                PAGE  83
Mullicipality of the District of Guysborotcgh addressed to the Deep Pafluke Coorc!inated Public
Review Secretariat, and iii) Recommendatio~~s     submitted by the Nova Scotia Environmental
Assessment Board to the Eiova Scotia Millister of Environment and Labor respecting Keltic
Petrachemical Inc.'s proposed LNG and petrochemical projcct.
It would appear from the testimony of Mr. Alan Ruffman, that all !hree dthese docuinents were
tendered as evidence by EnCana after I met with EnCana repm~tativeson March 2,2007,at
which time EnCana sought information h m me as to what my oral presentation at the Hearing
would be. As you know, Mr.Ruffinan, wllo is totally at arms length to me and who I had never
met, expressed that testimony relating to these exhibits should bc strickei~from tl;e public record.
 1 fiily agree. These exhibits, while long h o w n to EnCana,wcxr not filed by EnCana within the
time h c provided by the JDOP, Rather, tltcy were only filed by EnCana (and not provided to
me) after I met with EnCana on March 2,2007 and afier, upon questioning, I disclosed to
&Cana the sub6tance ofGreyhawk's forthcoming oral presentation.
It is my view that t~ccrptsfrom these docu~nmta,potentially .f~vorablcb EnCana, were "cheny
picked" by Mr. Grant and projected on a "scrccn' (while excerpts, potentially fa\forablclo
Greyhawk, were intentionally suppressed by Mr. Grant). In cross exan~ination,I was only asked
by Mr. Grant to confim that the verbiage he rccjted xcilrately reflnted the words which
appeared on the screen. it is axiomatic that, baniny m r s in Mr. Grant's recital of the words
which appeared on the "screen", the words he recited were the words which appatred on the
"xreed"     That,
             !    and only that. I agreed to, 1did not agree with the substance of ony of the
statements or mnckiisions contained therein.
Nolye of the three referenced documents (exhibits), respecring which I was asked to confirm the
wording of, were authored by me. Based on m y past experience with SOEI and M&NP, their
lawyers would have objected to any document being introduced as evidence, absent the author of
same being available for examination. Yet,it appears that these docim~entswere accepted as
evidence with Gruyhawk not having been given an opportunity to comment upon. or object to,
same. And Greyhawk does object. Unfortunately, unlilce EnCru~a,Greyhawk docs not have the
ability to pay rhousands of dollarslday to retail1 legal counsel. T do believe that, were Greyhawk
able to afford a lawyer to represen1 its interests, Greyhawk would have Jigaroudy objected to
these exhibits being introduced as evidence, outside of the tune frame provided by the JDQP, and
absent the authors of same being available for cross examination.
                                                        4
Having regard to the foregoing, I rcspmtiuflyask that the Co~~mmisdonw      and the NEB Member
attaclz no weight whatsoever to, and strike any and all refermce and testimony respecting, the
Decision ofLe Arbitration Committee, the letter from the Mu~~icipality     of tlre District of
i3uysbomugh addressed to the Deep Panuke Coordinated Public Review Secretariat, md the
Recommendations submitted by the Nova Swtia Environrnontal Assessment Board to the Nova
Scotia Ministor of Enviponmcnt and Labor respecting Keltic Petrochemical lnc.'s proposed LNG
and Petrochemical Project, fion the Deep Panuke Project Hearing public record.
                                                FIRST ECSSIRW  Mmr
1 would be pleaad to provide any funher information you may desire in this regard, and I look
forward to hearing from you in this matter.
Respectfully submitted.
