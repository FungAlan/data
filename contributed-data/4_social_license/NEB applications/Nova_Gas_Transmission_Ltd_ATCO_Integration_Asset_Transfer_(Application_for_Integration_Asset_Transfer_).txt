Attention: Ms. Sheri Young
Secretary of the Board
Dear Ms. Young:
Re: NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. ("NGTL")
Integration Asset Transfer Application ("Application")
Hearing Order GH-002-2014
Board File OF-Fac-Gas-N081-2013-17 01
ATCO Pigelines ("APH Letter of Comment
In accordance with Hearing Order GH-002-2014, AP hereby provides its Letter of
Comment with respect to the Application.
As the Board is aware, AP is the other natural gas transmission company
involved in the Integration initiative ("Integration"). AP is the transferor of the AP
assets being acquired by NGTL and the transferee of the assets being sold by
NGTL, all of which are the subject of the Application.
AP supports the Application. As the record demonstrates, the AP assets to be
transferred to NGTL have been properly maintained under the jurisdiction of the
Alberta Utilities Commission ("AUC") and have been subject to NGTL's due
diligence review.
As noted in paragraph 28 of the Application, the AUC has approved the transfer
of the AP assets to NGTL in conjunction with Integration. Approval of the
Application by the NEB is required to allow the asset swap contemplated by
Integration to proceed.
The NEB has previously endorsed the commercial aspects of Integration and
determined that the related asset swap appeared to be reasonable, while
deferring its ultimate decision on the swap pending receipt of the more detailed
Application, which is now before the Board:
The Board notes that NGTL presented the Settlement and the
Integration Agreement as a consolidated package and that
certain parties commented that their support for the Settlement

was conditional on the integration of the Alberta System with the

AP. Opportunity was provided for parties to comment on the

commercial implications of the Integration Agreement for the

rate design. No parties to this proceeding requested that the

Board reject the Integration Agreement. As noted earlier, the

Board has considered the Settlement and Integration

Agreement as a consolidated package. Accordingly, the Board

approves the Integration Agreement between NGTL and AP

insofar as its commercial implications are incorporated in

NGTL’s rate design methodology and services, including:

o the inclusion in NGTL’s annual revenue requirement of

the AUC-approved AP annual revenue requirement; and
o the process to implement integration and transition AP’s
customer contracts to NGTL.

In relation to NGTL’s request for approval in principle of the

Asset Swap, the Board takes note of the intent of the Integration

Agreement to create an integrated seamless Alberta natural gas

transmission service to customers. The Board will not make any

findings regarding the Asset Swap, which would be premature,

but considers that the Asset Swap appears reasonable and

offers the opportunity for operational efficiencies, reduced costs

and enhanced flexibility for coordinated system expansion,

which are usually indicative of public interest...‘
As NGTL notes in the Application (para. 32), the transfer of assets is proposed to
be accomplished through four separate "trenches" or closings. In approving AP's
asset transfer application, the AUC noted:

59. ...AP explained that it will not be requesting further

approvals for the Asset Swap, but will be applying for the

required pipeline and facility license transfers 30 days in

advance of the closing of each tranche. The Commission

considers that AP’s proposed timeline to address pipeline and

facility license transfers is reasonable. The Commission directs

AP to provide written notice to the AUC that the tranche is ready

to close 30 days prior to each tranche closing date in

accordance with Section 6(f) of the Transitional Operating

Agreementz
AP submits that NGTL's mirror request of the NEB, to approve the asset swap
with a requirement for NGTL to notify the NEB at least 30 days in advance of the
‘ NEB RHW-1-2010 Decision, p. 12.
2 AUG Decision 2012-310, para. 59, pp. 13-14.

closing of each tranche, is a reasonable and practical method of implementing
the swap.
In closing, AP notes that the asset swap is integral to completing Integration and
achieving some of its efficiency benefits. As such, AP respectfully submits that
approval of the Application is in the public interest.
Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact the
undersigned.
Yours truly,
S.J. Mah
