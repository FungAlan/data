       the Project
EPAC represents over 200 companies, the large majority being oil and gas production companies operating in
BC, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Annual investment by EPAC companies in drilling new wells and
constructing related facilities approaches $14 billion dollars or approximately one third of all non-oilsands
upstream investment in Western Canada. Our members operate 130,000 wells attached to 6,500 facilities
and collectively produce over 1.0 million boe/day of natural gas, crude oil and liquids.
Growing supply in the northwest part of the NGTL System in Alberta and BC and growing demand in
northeast Alberta has supported requests to NGTL for additional FT-R and FT-D service in those respective
areas and underpins the Project.
The NGTL System is a critical and central component of the upstream and midstream infrastructure in BC and
Alberta. Capacity availability and access to the NIT hub and the NGTL System for EPAC member companies,
particularly those with growing production volumes, pursuant to commercially reasonable tolls and tariff
terms is essential to the viability and success of the upstream sector.

1.     The need for the Project
Tourmaline Oil Corp. is one of the largest natural gas producers in Canada and is growing at a rapid pace since
starting up in 2008. We have large land positions in Alberta and BC, and are one of the largest shippers on the
current TransCanada Nova system. Over the past few years we have noticed a significant change in the
environment for pipeline transportation, and it is becoming increasingly more difficult to secure firm service.
The proposed expansion of the NGTL system is an important part of TOU’s growth plan, playing a key role in
meeting our growing supply. This expansion project would be an asset for both NGTL and the Alberta Oil and
Gas industry, by enhancing the system integrity and viability and freeing up more transportation for
producers such as Tourmaline to expand. The current economic environment is very competitive, and with
the present restrictions and bottle necks due to lack of service, we believe we have not been able to reach
our full potential as a natural gas player. As one of TransCanada’s larger customers we feel we would provide
a valuable perspective for the deliberation of the 2017 NGTL System expansion, and we hope you consider
our application.

 5.     The potential environmental and socio-economic effects of the Project, including those to be
       considered under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012.
7.     Potential impacts of the Project on Aboriginal interests.
10. Contingency planning for spills, accidents, or malfunctions, during construction and operations of the
       Project.
12. The terms and conditions to be included in any recommendation or approval the Board may issue for
       the Project
When there is a potential for disturbance or damages to the environment, now and in the future in the
construction of pipelines or expansion of oil and gas facilities, these actions impact Section 35 rights of
Aboriginal people under the Constitution of Canada whereby the rights of hunting, fishing, gathering, and
spiritual healing plant areas are diminished in size, and the native grasses and plants are infected with tame
grass and are over grown with noxious weeds that are than sprayed with harmful herbicides that do even
more damage to the land, air, and water. We the Aboriginal peoples of Canada being stewards of the land,
must insure that there is limited damage or the potential of greater damage to our traditional land use areas
must not be allowed to happen and must insure that damages be negated wherever possible. The East Prairie
Metis Settlement has not been given a notice by NGTL in regards to Consultation, Accommodation, or
Mitigation on this project and have that right to be Consulted. You cannot have Consultation without
Accommodation. The proposed pipeline expansion will effect either by accident or through the disturbance
to the land itself areas that fall within the East Prairie Metis Settlement Traditional Land Use areas. The East
Prairie Metis Settlement must have the chance to visit the sites, access the areas with our Elders and Spiritual
Healers to determine the impact this project may have in regards to the above concerns. There are in these
areas overlapping interests from other aboriginal groups but only the East Prairie Metis Settlement can speak
on behalf of the East Prairie Settlements Members thereby triggering this request for intervention

Environment Canada participation will be based on matters directly related to the Department’s mandate.
The Environment Canada mandate is determined by the statutes it administers including the Department of
the Environment Act; the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999; the Species at Risk Act; the
Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994; and the pollution prevention provisions of the Fisheries Act.
Environment Canada also has a lead role in supporting the Government of Canada’s implementation of the
Federal Policy on Wetland Conservation. Environment Canada’s legal authorities related to environmental
emergencies are inherent to the Department’s creation in 1971 under the Department of the Environment
Act. Since that time, the Department’s legal authorities related to environmental emergencies have been
broadened by the pollution prevention provisions of the Fisheries Act; the Migratory Birds Convention Act,
1994; the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA), 1999; the Emergency Management Act, 2007; and
the Federal Policy for Emergency Management (2009) (federal departmental planning responsibilities for
prevention/mitigation of, preparedness for, response to, and recovery from emergencies).

1.     The need for the Project
Advantage Oil & Gas (Advantage) would like show support regarding NOVA Gas Transmission (NGTL) 2017
NGTL System Expansion Project (the “Project”). Advantage is familiar with the project and is a contracted
shipper on the aforementioned pipeline system.
As a substantial Montney natural gas and producer, Advantage is acutely affected by the increase in demand
to transport gas on the NGTL system.
Advantage has contracted long-term firm-service commitments with NGTL in order to secure, and reliable
egress of product. We also expect the demand for transportation capacity to further increase, making the
Project necessary for sustained economic development of the Montney resource.

RE: National Energy Board Hearing Order GH-002-2015
NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL)
Application for the 2017 NGTL System Expansion (Project)
The Explorers and Producers Association of Canada Letter of Comment
The Explorers and Producers Association of Canada (“EPAC”) was granted the opportunity to participate
in the National Energy Board (“Board") GH-002-2015 proceeding in respect of the NOVA Gas
Transmission Ltd. (“NGTL”) Application for the 2017 NGTL System Expansion (the “Project”) (the
“Application”).1 This letter constitutes EPAC's Letter of Comment in respect of the Application.
Subject to the detailed comments below, EPAC fully supports and urges Board approval of the
Application as the incremental take-away capacity to be added in the Upstream James River Area2
(“UJRA”) of the NGTL System as part of the Project is urgently required by producers. The UJRA
includes the Montney, Horn River, Liard, Duvernay and Deep Basin development areas. The production
and supply from these areas have been growing since approximately 2010 and are forecast to grow
significantly over the next 10 years, more than offsetting the reduction of conventional gas production
from the entire Western Canada Sedimentary Basin.3 Gas produced from these areas is the most
competitive Canadian supply in the North American gas market and it is imperative that development of
this resource is not stifled or constrained due to both a lack of pipeline capacity and the inefficient use of
existing pipeline capacity.
EPAC producers respectfully submit that in approving the Application the Board must be mindful that
notwithstanding the incremental capacity that the Project will bring, producers have faced and will
continue to face systemic pipeline access issues on the NGTL System. The ability of producers in the
UJRA to obtain open access transportation service, that is comparable to other shippers on the NGTL
System, has been and will continue to be significantly constrained due to both a lack of timely and
necessary optimization and expansion of the system and the objective of NGTL to not unnecessarily
overbuild the system“. Notwithstanding that the latter is an appropriate subject for concern on the part of
NGTL, in the submission of EPAC this concern is unfounded in respect of the UJRA and as a result
NGTL has been unable to meet its contractual and transportation obligations owed to shippers on the
NGTL System.

EPAC
EPAC advocates on behalf of its member companies on issues affecting their business to ensure the
interests of its membership are considered. EPAC’s producer members are active in every region of
Western Canada and every resource play being developed. EPAC producer members include ten of the
top 25 natural gas producers in Canada and its members represent one third of the total annual upstream
spending in Canada’s conventional (non-oilsands) resource sector. Currently, EPAC members produce
over 1.0 MMBOE/ day from facilities in British Columbia. Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.
In the past three years EPAC member companies have invested from $10 to $15 billion annually to
develop and bring on stream new energy resources in Western Canada.
EPAC members are currently very active in the Montney, Horn River, Liard, Duvernay and Deep Basin
development areas and are fully dependent on obtaining open access transportation service on the NGTL
System.
List of Issues
In preparing this Letter of Comment, EPAC has framed its comments under the issues identified by the
Board in the List of Issues for the Application.5 In doing so, EPAC has focused its comments on those
issues that are currently of most importance to its members, namely the need for the Project (Board Issue
no.1). Further, the comments herein are the views of EPAC’s membership generally and are not
necessarily attributable to all members, or any single member, of EPAC.

The Experience of EPAC Members

EPAC’s comments herein arise in the context of the following general experience of EPAC members
holding Service Agreements6 on the NGTL System. Specifically:

. NGTL is unable to meet its capacity obligations under Service Agreements for FT-R Demand
Rate7 service (“FT-R Service”) in the UJRA in light of 2015 integrity and operational issues and as
a result EPAC members have not been able to obtain their full contract capacities, when they
have sought to, due to a lack of capacity and flexibility on the NGTL System. Notwithstanding
NGTL’s inability to provide service to meet full contract capacities, EPAC members have been
obligated to pay their full FT-R Service contract amount.

. NGTL is unable to permit the transfer of FT-R Service in the UJRA due to a lack of capacity and
flexibility on the NGTL System.

0 NGTL is substantially unable to make any lT-R Rate8 service (“lT-R Service”) available in the
UJRA.

. NGTL’s ability to add significant capacity to the NGTL System is primarily dependent on large
scale project applications which take an extended amount of time to develop, advance and
ultimately construct, with the result that new Service Agreements for FT-R Service often will not
result in service commencing for upwards of four years.

CANADA'S OIL &GAS ENTREPRENEURS‘.TM
The overall result is a complete lack of flexibility in the NGTL System for the provision of FT-R Service
and lT-R Service holders in the UJRA and a bar for shippers who require new FT-R Service in the UJRA
and who must wait upwards of four years for such service.
Issue Number 1: Need for the Project
The incremental take-away capacity to be added in the UJRA of the NGTL System as part of the Project
is urgently required by producers and for this reason the Board should approve the Application. Nothing
illustrates the need for the Project more than the following excerpt from the Application:
The FT-R contracts supporting the Project are the aggregate contract levels at the meter stations
within the UJRA shown in Figure 5-2 (Segments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 26). The aggregate
contracts associated with supply in the UJRA originate from all current and proposed receipt
stations in the design area. Many of the pipeline segments that comprise the UJRA have been
fully contracted since 2013 while others have been near fully contracted since 2010.
Specifically the Gordondale Segment (Segment 4) and the Grand Prairie Segment (Segment
7) were fully contracted in September 2013, the Western Alberta System Exchange Segment
(Segment 5) became fully contracted in March 2014 and the Central and Lodgepole Segments
(Segments 8 and 9) became fully contracted in July 2014. The Upper Peace River Mainline and
Northwest Mainline Segments (1 and 3) have been near fully contracted levels (95%) since
November 2010.9 [Emphasis added]
This excerpt also illustrates the systemic issues facing users of the NGTL System who seek timely access
to the system; and.the lack of a timely response by NGTL to ensure sufficient capacity. Specifically,
notwithstanding that since 2010 some of the segments of the NGTL System in the UJRA have been near
fully contracted and others have been fully contracted since 2013, it was not until the filing of the
Application in 2015 that NGTL took steps to address the need for new incremental take-way capacity —
most of which will not be in service until April 2017 if the Application is approved.10
Systemic Pigeline Access Issues on the NGTL System:
EPAC submits that the systemic pipeline access issues facing users of the NGTL System is, at least, in
part the result of the conservatism built into the forecasting methodology employed by NGTL to determine
what capacity is required and should be built. In the context of the UJRA, NGTL has used a “flow-through
design condition” methodology for determining the Project facilities in the UJRA and in doing so it has
substantially discounted actual contract demand as evidenced by capacity that is contracted under
Service Agreements for FT-R Service. It justifies this on the basis that it does not want to unnecessarily
overbuild the NGTL System.
In the Application, NGTL describes its forecasting methodology and how it determined the capacity
required in the UJRA. Specifically, NGTL states:
The Flow-Through design condition occurs when total area supply (sum of all receipts) exceeds the
total area demand (sum of deliveries). The Flow-Through condition prevails in the UJRA. Gas is
transported out of that area to meet NGTL System demands. When applying the Flow-Through
design condition, design flows are based on maximum day receipt and minimum day
deliveries in the UJRA. This forms the most constraining condition expected to occur and is
therefore used to determine facility requirements.

1° NGTL Application (81-01 /A4K1J4) at p 48.

CANADA'S OIL & GAS ENTREPRENEURSTM
The UJRA provides a majority of the supply for the NGTL System and nearly the entire area is
currently fully contracted. Additional facilities are required to meet increasing design ﬂows that are
supported by incremental contracted supply.
To obtain a maximum day receipt forecast, NGTL applies a peaking factor to the annual average
receipt forecast. This peaking factor is based on NGTL’s experience with flows on the NGTL
System and reflects the historically observed amount by which peak values exceed the
average flow.
NGTL also determines whether these peaked receipt ﬂows exceed the expected downstream
deliveries. If that is the case, NGTL applies a suppIy-demand balancing assumption in its design to
match supply to its forecasted downstream demand (i.e., what NGTL actually expects to flow) to
avoid unnecessarily overbuilding the System.
The Receipt Design Flow for the UJRA was generated by applying peak factors and the
supply-demand balancing assumption to the forecasted supply profile, which represents the
best prediction of receipt distribution in the area... The winter season is the most constrained
season as this is when system demand and the corresponding receipts are the greatest. The
winter suppIy-demand balancing factors between Winter 2017 and Winter 2018 vary from
78%-84%....“ [Emphasis added]

Notwithstanding NGTL’s desire to avoid unnecessarily overbuilding the NGTL System, which EPAC fully
supports, its current forecasting methodology renders NGTL unable to meet its contractual and
transportation obligations for not only those shippers holding FT-R Service but also for those shippers
seeking IT—R Service. The inadequacies in NGTL’s forecasting methodology are, two-fold.
First, although NGTL describes that the UJRA is “fully contracted” in fact NGTL has “oversold” the NGTL
System capacity. In the Peace River Area (the “PRA") of the NGTL System (which includes the UJRA),
the system is currently over contracted by approximately 1,800 MMof/d (or 20%) meaning the NGTL
System in the PRA is capable of only transporting approximately 80-85% of the FT-R Service capacity
currently contracted.12 Unfortunately, this short-fall in capacity will not be addressed through the Project,
but instead will be further impaired. After the Project is in service, the PRA will be over contracted by
approximately 2,700 MMcf/d (or approximately 25%), resulting in the NGTL System in the PRA being
capable of only transporting approximately 75-80% of the FT-R Service capacity contracted.13
Second, by using a “peaking factor" that is based on “the historically observed amount by which peak
values exceed the average flow”14 in the UJRA, the resulting forecast numbers would appear to be
inherently flawed. As noted above, incremental take-way capacity on the NGTL System has been
required in the UJRA since at least 2010 and as a result both the historical average flow and the historical
peaking factors used by NGTL very likely under-estimate the actual demand for capacity since there has
been a historical shortfall in such capacity. This underestimation of demand is demonstrated by the
simple fact that, despite the additional incremental capacity from the Project, the amount of over-
contracting of the NGTL System in the UJRA is increasing instead of decreasing, which will further
exacerbate the problem with using historical average flow and historical average peaking numbers to
determine the amount of new capacity required.

CANADA'S OIL & GAS ENTREPRENEURS}TM
For the reasons above, EPAC respectfully submits that the forecasting methodology employed by NGTL
under—estimates the amount of new incremental takeaway capacity required on the NGTL System — at
least in so far as it is used for areas of the system that are seeing continuous and significant year-over-
year growth in Service Agreements for FT-R Service — when there is a clear lag (e.g. four or more years)
in new capacity coming into service. In areas on the NGTL System like the UJRA, NGTL should be
required to build capacity that meets or exceeds its FT-R Service obligations. In not doing so, NGTL fails
to meet its obligations under its Service Agreements; fails to provide sufficient flexibility so as to permit

FT-R Shippers to transfer their contracted capacity under the NGTL Tariff; and it substantially fails to

make any IT-R Service available.

Need for Urgency in Resolving Cagacity Issues on the NGTL System:

Notwithstanding that many of the pipeline segments that comprise the UJRA have been fully contracted

since 2013 while others have been near fully contracted since 201015, NGTL has been extremely slow to

take steps to address the clear need for new incremental takeaway capacity. The fact that it can take

upwards of four years to obtain new FT-R Service is, in the submission of EPAC, unacceptable. Such a

delay has serious and real implications to producers seeking to obtain access to the NGTL System and

has serious and real implications to resource development in the UJRA.

Since 2010 NGTL has sought to implement most, if not all, of the new incremental takeaway capacity on

the NGTL System through large scale projects and applications to the Board."5 These applications take a

significant amount of time to develop, advance and ultimately construct. As an example, the Project

Description for this Application was first filed with the Board in December 2014 and if the Application is

approved, the facilities will not be in-service until at least April 2017.17 Using only large scale projects and

applications leaves NGTL unable to respond in a timely manner to the needs of shippers and to the
urgent need to address the clear and persistent short-fall in takeaway capacity, particularly in the UJRA.
Based on NGTL’s apparent preference for large scale projects, it does not appear that NGTL conducts
any optimization studies to see if there are smaller discrete de-bottlenecking projects that could be
completed on the NGTL System to provide incremental takeaway capacity in a much shorter time frame.18

EPAC believes that an efficiency and optimization review of the NGTL System should be conducted with

the purpose of identifying inefficiencies and bottlenecks on the system and recommending efficiencies

and smaller debottlenecking projects that can be implemented in a timely manner.

Such a review is not intended in any way to supplant or duplicate the larger project application process

that NGTL has in place, but instead would be complimentary in that it would look for discrete and creative

ways to provide new incremental takeaway capacity in a more timely manner.
Concluding Comments and Recommendations for the Board’s Consideration

The incremental take-away capacity to be added in the UJRA of the NGTL System as part of the Project

is urgently required by producers and for this reason the Board should approve the Application. In

addition, EPAC respectfully submits that in approving the Application the Board should direct NGTL:

‘6 Notably National Energy Board proceedings: GH-2-2010 (Horn River); GH-2-2011 (Northwest Mainline
Expansion); GH-001-2012 (Northwest Mainline Komie North Extension); GH-003-2014 (Wolverine River Lateral
Loop — Carmon Creek Section); and GH-002-2015 (2017 NGTL System Expansion).

‘7 NGTL Application Appendix 56 (81-06 / A4K1J9) at p 6.

18 Such projects could take the form, if applicable, of applications made pursuant to section 58, versus 52, of the
National Energy Board Act and for this reason take much less time to complete.

CANADA'S OIL &GAS ENTREPRENEURSTM
. To conduct and implement an efficiency and optimization review of the NGTL System to identify
inefficiencies and bottlenecks on the system and to recommend efficiencies and smaller
debottlenecking projects that can be implemented in a timely manner. The review should be
conducted within six months of the Board’s decision on the Application. NGTL should file, with
the Board, a report outlining how it conducted the review and the resulting recommendations.
Concurrently with that filing, NGLT should confirm which of the recommended efficiencies and
debottlenecking projects it will implement along with the associated timelines to complete these
projects.
. To, in preparing and filing its next system expansion application, design the NGTL System in the

UJRA so as to result in the system having takeaway capacity equivalent to at least 100% of the
FT-R Service capacity contracted. This will permit NGTL to meet its FT-R Service obligations in
the UJRA, something it has not been able to do, and should result in sufficient flexibility in the
system so as to permit the transfer of FT-R Service and the provision of lT-R Service.

EPAC submits that the first recommendation above will, at least in part, address the required urgency in

resolving capacity issues on the NGTL System. It is further submitted that the second proposed

recommendation will ensure that the systemic pipeline access issues facing users of the NGTL System

are addressed and ultimately resolved. It is simply unacceptable for NGTL to continue to plan and

operate the NGTL System in a manner that results in over contracting its FT-R Service in the PRA by

approximately 25% and the NGTL System being capable of only transporting approximately 75-80% of

the FT-R Service capacity contracted in the PRA. The incremental takeaway capacity for the UJRA

raises the appropriate question of where the incremental gas can be marketed. As noted previously, gas

produced from the UJRA is the most competitive Canadian supply available to the North American market

and, as such, will find a market. It is vital that development of this resource not be constrained due to

lack of pipeline capacity and inefficiencies in utilization of existing capacity.

Conclusion

For the reasons outlined above, EPAC urges the Board to approve the Application as the incremental

takeaway capacity to be added to the UJRA of the NGTL System is urgently required. In doing so, EPAC

respectfully requests that the Board consider the recommendations outlined above.

Sincerely,

The Explorers and Producers Association of Canada

NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL)
Application for the 2017 NGTL System Expansion (Project)
The Explorers and Producers Association of Canada Letter of Comment
The Explorers and Producers Association of Canada (“EPAC”) was granted the opportunity to participate in
the National Energy Board (“Board”) GH-002-2015 proceeding in respect of the NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd.
(“NGTL”) Application for the 2017 NGTL System Expansion (the “Project”) (the “Application”). This letter

 constitutes EPAC’s Letter of Comment in respect of the Application.
Subject to the detailed comments below, EPAC fully supports and urges Board approval of the Application as
the incremental take-away capacity to be added in the Upstream James River Area (“UJRA”) of the NGTL
System as part of the Project is urgently required by producers. The UJRA includes the Montney, Horn River,
Liard, Duvernay and Deep Basin development areas. The production and supply from these areas have been
growing since approximately 2010 and are forecast to grow significantly over the next 10 years, more than
offsetting the reduction of conventional gas production from the entire Western Canada Sedimentary Basin.
Gas produced from these areas is the most competitive Canadian supply in the North American gas market
and it is imperative that development of this resource is not stifled or constrained due to both a lack of
pipeline capacity and the inefficient use of existing pipeline capacity.
EPAC producers respectfully submit that in approving the Application the Board must be mindful that
notwithstanding the incremental capacity that the Project will bring, producers have faced and will continue
to face systemic pipeline access issues on the NGTL System. The ability of producers in the UJRA to obtain
open access transportation service, that is comparable to other shippers on the NGTL System, has been and
will continue to be significantly constrained due to both a lack of timely and necessary optimization and
expansion of the system and the objective of NGTL to not unnecessarily overbuild the system .
Notwithstanding that the latter is an appropriate subject for concern on the part of NGTL, in the submission
of EPAC this concern is unfounded in respect of the UJRA and as a result NGTL has been unable to meet its
contractual and transportation obligations owed to shippers on the NGTL System.
EPAC
EPAC advocates on behalf of its member companies on issues affecting their business to ensure the interests
of its membership are considered. EPAC’s producer members are active in every region of Western Canada
and every resource play being developed. EPAC producer members include ten of the top 25 natural gas
producers in Canada and its members represent one third of the total annual upstream spending in Canada’s
conventional (non-oilsands) resource sector. Currently, EPAC members produce over 1.0 MMBOE/ day from
facilities in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.
In the past three years EPAC member companies have invested from $10 to $15 billion annually to develop
and bring on stream new energy resources in Western Canada.
EPAC members are currently very active in the Montney, Horn River, Liard, Duvernay and Deep Basin
development areas and are fully dependent on obtaining open access transportation service on the NGTL
System.
List of Issues
In preparing this Letter of Comment, EPAC has framed its comments under the issues identified by the Board
in the List of Issues for the Application. In doing so, EPAC has focused its comments on those issues that are
currently of most importance to its members, namely the need for the Project (Board Issue no.1). Further,
the comments herein are the views of EPAC’s membership generally and are not necessarily attributable to
all members, or any single member, of EPAC.
The Experience of EPAC Members
EPAC’s comments herein arise in the context of the following general experience of EPAC members holding

 Service Agreements on the NGTL System.
Specifically:
• NGTL is unable to meet its capacity obligations under Service Agreements for FT-R Demand Rate service
(“FT-R Service”) in the UJRA in light of 2015 integrity and operational issues and as a result EPAC members
have not been able to obtain their full contract capacities, when they have sought to, due to a lack of
capacity and flexibility on the NGTL System. Notwithstanding NGTL’s inability to provide service to meet full
contract capacities, EPAC members have been obligated to pay their full FT-R Service contract amount.
• NGTL is unable to permit the transfer of FT-R Service in the UJRA due to a lack of capacity and flexibility on
the NGTL System.
• NGTL is substantially unable to make any IT-R Rate service (“IT-R Service”) available in the UJRA.
• NGTL’s ability to add significant capacity to the NGTL System is primarily dependent on large scale project
applications which take an extended amount of time to develop, advance and ultimately construct, with the
result that new Service Agreements for FT-R Service often will not result in service commencing for upwards
of four years.
The overall result is a complete lack of flexibility in the NGTL System for the provision of FT-R Service and IT-R
Service holders in the UJRA and a bar for shippers who require new FT-R Service in the UJRA and who must
wait upwards of four years for such service.
Issue Number 1: Need for the Project
The incremental take-away capacity to be added in the UJRA of the NGTL System as part of the Project is
urgently required by producers and for this reason the Board should approve the Application. Nothing
illustrates the need for the Project more than the following excerpt from the Application:
The FT-R contracts supporting the Project are the aggregate contract levels at the meter stations within the
UJRA shown in Figure 5-2 (Segments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 26). The aggregate contracts associated with
supply in the UJRA originate from all current and proposed receipt stations in the design area. Many of the
pipeline segments that comprise the UJRA have been fully contracted since 2013 while others have been
near fully contracted since 2010. Specifically the Gordondale Segment (Segment 4) and the Grand Prairie
Segment (Segment 7) were fully contracted in September 2013, the Western Alberta System Exchange
Segment (Segment 5) became fully contracted in March 2014 and the Central and Lodgepole Segments
(Segments 8 and 9) became fully contracted in July 2014. The Upper Peace River Mainline and Northwest
Mainline Segments (1 and 3) have been near fully contracted levels (95%) since November 2010. [Emphasis
added.]
This excerpt also illustrates the systemic issues facing users of the NGTL System who seek timely access to
the system; and the lack of a timely response by NGTL to ensure sufficient capacity. Specifically,
notwithstanding that since 2010 some of the segments of the NGTL System in the UJRA have been near fully
contracted and others have been fully contracted since 2013, it was not until the filing of the Application in
2015 that NGTL took steps to address the need for new incremental take-way capacity – most of which will
not be in service until April 2017 if the Application is approved.
Systemic Pipeline Access Issues on the NGTL System:
EPAC submits that the systemic pipeline access issues facing users of the NGTL System is, at least, in part the
result of the conservatism built into the forecasting methodology employed by NGTL to determine what
capacity is required and should be built. In the context of the UJRA, NGTL has used a “flow-through design
517 Tenth Avenue SW                                                                 Telephone/Téléphone : (403) 292-4800

 condition” methodology for determining the Project facilities in the UJRA and in doing so it has substantially
discounted actual contract demand as evidenced by capacity that is contracted under Service Agreements for
FT-R Service. It justifies this on the basis that it does not want to unnecessarily overbuild the NGTL System.
In the Application, NGTL describes its forecasting methodology and how it determined the capacity required
in the UJRA. Specifically, NGTL states:
The Flow-Through design condition occurs when total area supply (sum of all receipts) exceeds the total area
demand (sum of deliveries). The Flow-Through condition prevails in the UJRA. Gas is transported out of that
area to meet NGTL System demands. When applying the Flow-Through design condition, design flows are
based on maximum day receipt and minimum day deliveries in the UJRA. This forms the most constraining
condition expected to occur and is therefore used to determine facility requirements.
The UJRA provides a majority of the supply for the NGTL System and nearly the entire area is currently fully
contracted. Additional facilities are required to meet increasing design flows that are supported by
incremental contracted supply.
To obtain a maximum day receipt forecast, NGTL applies a peaking factor to the annual average receipt
forecast. This peaking factor is based on NGTL’s experience with flows on the NGTL System and reflects the
historically observed amount by which peak values exceed the average flow.
NGTL also determines whether these peaked receipt flows exceed the expected downstream deliveries. If
that is the case, NGTL applies a supply-demand balancing assumption in its design to match supply to its
forecasted downstream demand (i.e., what NGTL actually expects to flow) to avoid unnecessarily
overbuilding the System.
The Receipt Design Flow for the UJRA was generated by applying peak factors and the supply-demand
balancing assumption to the forecasted supply profile, which represents the best prediction of receipt
distribution in the area… The winter season is the most constrained season as this is when system demand
and the corresponding receipts are the greatest. The winter supply-demand balancing factors between
Winter 2017 and Winter 2018 vary from 78%-84%.... [Emphasis added.]
Notwithstanding NGTL’s desire to avoid unnecessarily overbuilding the NGTL System, which EPAC fully
supports, its current forecasting methodology renders NGTL unable to meet its contractual and
transportation obligations for not only those shippers holding FT-R Service but also for those shippers
seeking IT-R Service. The inadequacies in NGTL’s forecasting methodology are, two-fold.
First, although NGTL describes that the UJRA is “fully contracted” in fact NGTL has “oversold” the NGTL
System capacity. In the Peace River Area (the “PRA”) of the NGTL System (which includes the UJRA), the
system is currently over contracted by approximately 1,800 MMcf/d (or 20%) meaning the NGTL System in
the PRA is capable of only transporting approximately 80-85% of the FT-R Service capacity currently
contracted. Unfortunately, this short-fall in capacity will not be addressed through the Project, but instead
will be further impaired. After the Project is in service, the PRA will be over contracted by approximately
2,700 MMcf/d (or approximately 25%), resulting in the NGTL System in the PRA being capable of only
transporting approximately 75-80% of the FT-R Service capacity contracted.
Second, by using a “peaking factor” that is based on “the historically observed amount by which peak values
exceed the average flow” in the UJRA, the resulting forecast numbers would appear to be inherently flawed.
As noted above, incremental take-way capacity on the NGTL System has been required in the UJRA since at
least 2010 and as a result both the historical average flow and the historical peaking factors used by NGTL
517 Tenth Avenue SW                                                                  Telephone/Téléphone : (403) 292-4800
Calgary, Alberta T2R 0A8                                                             Facsimile/Télécopieur : (403) 292-5503
                                                                                                http://www..neb-one.gc.ca
517, Dixième Avenue S.-O.                                                                                   1-800-899-1265
Calgary, (Alberta) T2R 0A8                                                                                                4
 very likely under-estimate the actual demand for capacity since there has been a historical shortfall in such
capacity. This underestimation of demand is demonstrated by the simple fact that, despite the additional
incremental capacity from the Project, the amount of over-contracting of the NGTL System in the UJRA is
increasing instead of decreasing, which will further exacerbate the problem with using historical average flow
and historical average peaking numbers to determine the amount of new capacity required.
For the reasons above, EPAC respectfully submits that the forecasting methodology employed by NGTL
under-estimates the amount of new incremental takeaway capacity required on the NGTL System – at least
in so far as it is used for areas of the system that are seeing continuous and significant year-over-year growth
in Service Agreements for FT-R Service – when there is a clear lag (e.g. four or more years) in new capacity
coming into service. In areas on the NGTL System like the UJRA, NGTL should be required to build capacity
that meets or exceeds its FT-R Service obligations. In not doing so, NGTL fails to meet its obligations under its
Service Agreements; fails to provide sufficient flexibility so as to permit FT-R Shippers to transfer their
contracted capacity under the NGTL Tariff; and it substantially fails to make any IT-R Service available.
Need for Urgency in Resolving Capacity Issues on the NGTL System:
Notwithstanding that many of the pipeline segments that comprise the UJRA have been fully contracted
since 2013 while others have been near fully contracted since 2010 , NGTL has been extremely slow to take
steps to address the clear need for new incremental takeaway capacity. The fact that it can take upwards of
four years to obtain new FT-R Service is, in the submission of EPAC, unacceptable. Such a delay has serious
and real implications to producers seeking to obtain access to the NGTL System and has serious and real
implications to resource development in the UJRA.
Since 2010 NGTL has sought to implement most, if not all, of the new incremental takeaway capacity on the
NGTL System through large scale projects and applications to the Board. These applications take a
significant amount of time to develop, advance and ultimately construct. As an example, the Project
Description for this Application was first filed with the Board in December 2014 and if the Application is
approved, the facilities will not be in-service until at least April 2017. Using only large scale projects and
applications leaves NGTL unable to respond in a timely manner to the needs of shippers and to the urgent
need to address the clear and persistent short-fall in takeaway capacity, particularly in the UJRA.
 Based on NGTL’s apparent preference for large scale projects, it does not appear that NGTL conducts any
optimization studies to see if there are smaller discrete de-bottlenecking projects that could be completed
on the NGTL System to provide incremental takeaway capacity in a much shorter time frame. EPAC believes
that an efficiency and optimization review of the NGTL System should be conducted with the purpose of
identifying inefficiencies and bottlenecks on the system and recommending efficiencies and smaller
debottlenecking projects that can be implemented in a timely manner.
Such a review is not intended in any way to supplant or duplicate the larger project application process that
NGTL has in place, but instead would be complimentary in that it would look for discrete and creative ways
to provide new incremental takeaway capacity in a more timely manner.
Concluding Comments and Recommendations for the Board’s Consideration
The incremental take-away capacity to be added in the UJRA of the NGTL System as part of the Project is
urgently required by producers and for this reason the Board should approve the Application. In addition,
EPAC respectfully submits that in approving the Application the Board should direct NGTL:

 • To conduct and implement an efficiency and optimization review of the NGTL System to identify
inefficiencies and bottlenecks on the system and to recommend efficiencies and smaller debottlenecking
projects that can be implemented in a timely manner. The review should be conducted within six months of
the Board’s decision on the Application. NGTL should file, with the Board, a report outlining how it
conducted the review and the resulting recommendations. Concurrently with that filing, NGLT should
confirm which of the recommended efficiencies and debottlenecking projects it will implement along with
the associated timelines to complete these projects.
• To, in preparing and filing its next system expansion application, design the NGTL System in the UJRA so as
to result in the system having takeaway capacity equivalent to at least 100% of the FT-R Service capacity
contracted. This will permit NGTL to meet its FT-R Service obligations in the UJRA, something it has not been
able to do, and should result in sufficient flexibility in the system so as to permit the transfer of FT-R Service
and the provision of IT-R Service.
EPAC submits that the first recommendation above will, at least in part, address the required urgency in
resolving capacity issues on the NGTL System. It is further submitted that the second proposed
recommendation will ensure that the systemic pipeline access issues facing users of the NGTL System are
addressed and ultimately resolved. It is simply unacceptable for NGTL to continue to plan and operate the
NGTL System in a manner that results in over contracting its FT-R Service in the PRA by approximately 25%
and the NGTL System being capable of only transporting approximately 75-80% of the FT-R Service capacity
contracted in the PRA. The incremental takeaway capacity for the UJRA raises the appropriate question of
where the produced gas can be marketed. As noted previously, gas produced from the UJRA is the most
competitive Canadian supply available to the North American market and, as such, will find a market. It is
vital that development of this resource not be constrained due to lack of pipeline capacity and inefficiencies
in utilization of existing capacity.
Conclusion
For the reasons outlined above, EPAC urges the Board to approve the Application as the incremental
takeaway capacity to be added to the UJRA of the NGTL System is urgently required. In doing so, EPAC

          Possible Conditions for Comment
  We represent the East Prairie Metis Settlement ("EPMS") with regard to the above-captioned
  matter, and have been instructed by our ciient to provide you with the views of EPMS regarding
  the appropriate conditions to be placed by the National Energy Board ("NEB") NGTL regarding the
  Project. Our client's comments relate to the possible conditions set out in Appendix 1 to Hearing
  Order GH-002-2015, which was issued by the NEB on November 30, 2015.
  The foundation for the comments set out below is the Commentary to NGTL 2017 Pipeline
  Expansion ("Commentary") prepared by Robert L'Hirondelle, EPMS Consultation Officer, a copy
  of which is attached as Attachment "A" to this letter. In terms of the organization of this letter, we
 will begin with a summary of the concerns set out in the Commentary, and this will be followed by
 suggestions as to how these concerns could be reflected and potentially addressed in conditions
  imposed by the NEB on NGTL regarding the Project. However, before beginning this process it is
 appropriate to provide you with an introduction to EPMS.
 East Prairie Metis Settlement
The characterization of EPMS as a community that holds and may exercise Aboriginal rights is
 recognized as a matter of provincial law, the Constitution Act, 1982, and common law.
 EPMS is one of the eight Metis Settlements that obtained constitutional recognition and protection
in the Constitution of Alberta Amendment Act, 1990 ("CAAA").1 This constitutional recognition
reflects the historic fact that the Metis communities that find modern expression in the Alberta
Metis Settlements pre-existed the Province of Alberta, a pre-existence that exceeds the creation
of the Province by more than a century. While the recognitions in the CAAA had no direct

relationship with the subject of Aboriginal rights (the determination of such a matter being beyond
the constitutional authority or competence of a province), the reason identified to justify the CAAA
in 1990 (the fact that the Metis Settlements were the successors of Alberta Metis communities
that pre-existed the settlement and creation of Alberta), would in 2003 be identified by the
Supreme Court of Canada in its Powley decision2 to be the common law basis for the
contemporary existence of Metis Aboriginal rights-bearing communities.3
As a result of the interaction of subsections 35(1) and 35(2) of the Constitution Act, 1982, Powley
and the subsequent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Haida4, the obligations of the
Crown (either federal or provincial as dictated by constitutional jurisdiction)5 to communities in the
situation of EPMS with regard to decisions such as those required with regard to the Project can
be summarized very briefly.
    1.       The Constitution Act, 1982 recognizes and affirms the Aboriginal rights of Canadian
             Aboriginal peoples.6
    2.       Metis     are  included     among    the Aboriginal        peoples      whose Aboriginal         rights    are
             recognized and affirmed.7
    3.       The clearest examples of the Aboriginal rights that are possessed and exercised by
            Aboriginal communities are traditional harvesting activities such as those underlying the
             concerns expressed in the Commentary.8
    4.      The duty of the Crown to consult with Aboriginal peoples arises when the Crown has
             knowledge, real or constructive, of the potential existence of an Aboriginal right and

       Aboriginal rights are neither frozen nor necessarily limited to traditional harvesting practices, this topic will not
       be pursued since the concerns of EPMS as set out in the Commentary are expressed in the context of
       harvesting.

               contemplates conduct (including decision-making regarding the activities of third
               parties) that might adversely affect it.9
 In the specific context of EPMS, we and our client are of the view that the recognition in the CAAA
 of the pre-existence of Alberta Metis communities at the time of the creation of Alberta renders
 unnecessary the need for further evidence in support of the conclusions that EPMS is a
 contemporary Metis community that possesses Aboriginal rights10 and that EPMS is entitled to
 consultation by the Crown whenever the latter considers actions or decisions that might infringe
 these rights. However, we have been directed by our client to make reference to the relevant
 historical evidence.
Although EPMS was established as a corporation in the Metis Settlements Act11 in 1990 and had
earlier been designated as a "colony" by Order-in-Council,12 these actions recognized rather than
created EPMS. Rather, the M6tis who comprised the historic Metis community of EPMS were
persons who had occupied a broad expanse of west-central and north-west Alberta as early as
the 1790s. From then until the early twentieth century, these Metis made up a community
distinguishable from the First Nations or persons of European ancestry. The Metis were crucial to
the fur trade of western and northern North America, and constituted a majority of the population
of a wide network of fur trade establishments at fixed points scattered as far afield as the Great
Lakes and the drainage basins of the Winnipeg, Saskatchewan, Peace, Athabasca, Mackenzie
and Columbia Rivers, as well as the trade and travel routes connecting these fixed points and the
hinterlands of them in which trapping and hunting, the first step in a multinational commercial
enterprise took place.13
Historic traditional land use ("TLU") studies reveal that the ancestors of the current members of
EPMS operated within and surrounding a trapezoid-shaped network, the fixed points of which
were Edmonton, the two ends of Lesser Slave Lake, and Jasper. However, in identifying these
fixed points, it must not be assumed that the lines connecting these points established the
boundaries of the network. Rather, each of these fixed points also acted as the centre of a
circular-shaped area that comprised its hinterlands, some of which were within the trapezoid and
others outside it. Accordingly, the hinterlands of the community extended north of Lesser Slave
Lake and south of Edmonton, Jasper, and the line connecting the two. Accordingly, the location of

 EPMS near High Prairie places it in the northern part of its larger historical community that takes
 in both the Swan Hills and the eastern slopes.
The requirement in Powley that a historic Metis community exist prior to the date of "effective
European control" is easily met. This community took shape well before the arrival of any
permanent residents of European ancestry or indeed any of the symbols of a colonial presence
other than a few dozen fur trade employees and a handful of missionaries. The first visit by a
representative of the Northwest Mounted Police passed through the Lesser Slave Lake region in
1897 and there was no police presence in Jasper until the next decade. At the turn of the
twentieth century the only Dominion Lands Office anywhere near the area was in Edmonton, and
outside of Edmonton and Saint Albert in the southeast part of the regional community, the only
land survey before 1910 was that of the riverlots in Grouard. As for the requirement of a
contemporary Metis community linked to the historic one, the threshold for satisfying this standard
is not high14 and the recognition of EPMS as a "colony" in the 1930s and the continued existence
of EPMS renders any further discussion of the topic moot.
Expanding upon the Robert L'Hirondelle Commentary
The concerns expressed in the Commentary prepared by Robert L'Hirondelle on behalf of EPMS
are discussed in somewhat mored detail below.
     1.        The construction of the Project will ease access to areas within the Traditional Territory
               of EPMS; for non-Aboriginal seasonal hunters, which will limit the availability of wildlife
              to EPMS harvesters if sustainable wildlife populations are to be maintained.
    2.        The impact of reduced numbers of wildlife that are available for harvesting by EPMS
               members far transcends the financial cost of replacing harvested meat and other
              animal products from commercial sources. The necessary change to a less healthy diet
              will have a direct impact on the health of the community and the cultural damage
              resulting from the removal of a purpose for the inter-generational transfer of harvesting
              skills (and the respect and reverence for all elements of the environment, including the
              animals harvested) will be irreparable.
    3.        Even in absence of ail-too familiar and increasingly-frequent catastrophic ruptures of
              and discharges from pipelines, even routine activities associated with the construction
              of pipelines can mean disaster for plants, animals, and humans.
              •    Beyond obvious surface disturbance of the rare areas where specialized conditions
                  to allow individual plants valued for food and medicinal purposes to flourish, routine

                pipelines can have less obvious but equally significant (and long-term) impacts
                below ground. Should the unique composition of soil necessary for particular
                vegetation be disrupted by a process as routine as mixing topsoil and subsoil as part
                of the breaking and re-packing of the soil, the possibility of reclamation may be
                precluded.
           •    An even greater threat is presented by the possible routine introduction of
                contaminants into soil and part of the construction and maintenance process. This
                can be done accidentally through such things as the introduction of non-native
                contaminants on the tires or underside of motorized vehicles or negligently through
                a lack of consideration of the complete chemical compensation of "forestry mixture"
                used to stimulate regrowth.
           •    This type of contamination may not be obvious for years or even generations,
                particularly if the regrowth of vegetation appears to proceed impressively. However,
                the long-term result may be the introduction of a noxious substance into the food
                chain, moving from plants to animals and ultimately to humans, particularly
                Aboriginal persons and communities whose lifestyle is grounded in the harvesting of
                wildlife for subsistence purposes.
            •   Monitoring regarding these concerns must be required by the NEB through
                conditions placed on NGTL regarding the Project. Based on past experience, EPMS
                and other Aboriginal communities cannot have any confidence in a monitoring
                process regarding these matters unless the design and implementation of the
                monitoring process and Elders and other members of EPMS as well as subject
                matter experts representing EPMS have a prominent role in this design and
                implementation.
SPECIFIC IMPACT OF EPMS CONCERNS ON CONDITIONS
EPMS asks that the NEB in moving from the suggested conditions circulated on November 30,
2015 to conditions that will ultimately be imposed on NGTL regarding the Project, the suggestions
set out below in the context of the suggested conditions be reflected in the ultimate conditions.
     1. Issues relating to soil contamination and soil disruption should be addressed in the
        reclamation plan referenced in Condition 7(b).
    2. A plan to monitor and prevent against the introduction of noxious substances into the food
        chain should be a required element of the Environmental Protection Plan described in
        Condition 7.

                                                   - b -
     3.  NGTL, in its TLU report referenced in Condition 9(c) should be required to include inter
         alia details regarding how the specific concerns raised by EPMS regarding soil
         contamination (and its potential impact on the food chain) and soil disruption and what
         actions would be taken to prevent or mitigate these were addressed directly with EPMS
         (although EPMS would be happy to see the requirement relate to all Aboriginal
         communities).
     4. The concerns expressed by EPMS regarding soil contamination (and its potential impact
         on the food chain) and soil disruption and the success or failure of measures taken to
         prevent or mitigate these should be referenced in the Post-Construction Monitoring
         Reports mandated by Condition 31 (b).
As a general recommendation, EPMS believes that there should be more provision for Aboriginal
 involvement in the design and implementation of monitory processes referenced throughout the
suggested conditions.
We do not wish to create the impression that the concerns of EPMS regarding the Project are
limited to those referenced in this letter. However, given the crucial importance of these issues
and the lack of attention to these subjects by either industry or the regulatory process in the past,
we have been directed by our client to limit our comments to those set out herein.
Yours truly,

Subject: Health Canada’s Letter of Comment on the Environmental Impact Statement to
the National Energy Board (N EB) for the 2017 NGTL System Expansion (GH-002-2015;
OF—Fac-Gas-N081-2014-20 02)
Dear Ms. Young:
As a registered Commenter, Health Canada (HC) respectfully submits this Letter of Comment to
the National Energy Board (N EB) on the proposed 2017 NGTL System Expansion (the Project)
for consideration.
HC is the federal department responsible for helping Canadians maintain and improve their
health. Its participation in the enviromnental assessment process as a Federal Authority as
deﬁned by Section 20 of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act 2012 (CEAA 2012), is to
provide the NEB in its capacity as Responsible Authority with specialist or expert information or
knowledge in its possession with respect to the Proj ect. Accordingly, HC provided its expertise
in the areas of air quality, drinking and recreational water quality, noise, contamination of
country foods, and human health risk assessment. Consistent with subsection 5(1)(c) of CEAA
2012, HC focused its review on impacts of the Project on the health of Aboriginal peoples, and
paid special attention to health concerns raised by Aboriginal peoples during the environmental
assessment process.
HC has reviewed the following documents: (1) Project’s Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)
and Environmental and Socio-Economic Assessment (ESA) dated March 01, 2015; (2) '
information requests and responses up until November 23, 2015; and (3) NEB Possible
Conditions for Comment1 dated November 30, 2015. The review was completed in relation to
the following issues on the List of Issueszz

0 The potential environmental and socio-economic effects of the Proj ect, including those to
be considered under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012.

0 Potential impacts of the Project on Aboriginal interests.
HC notes two key areas of concern with regards to the application speciﬁc to our areas of
expertise: air quality and noise. Speciﬁc information gaps or areas of clariﬁcation are identiﬁed
as identiﬁed below and in more detail in Table 1.
With regards to air quality, quantitative air dispersion modelling was not conducted for the
construction and decommissioning phases of the pipeline or compressor stations. It is HC’s view
that these two areas should be assessed as there are likely emissions during these two phases of a
project. Omission of the construction and decommissioning stages from an air quality assessment
could lead to an underestimation of risk to human health. Further, as indicated in subsection A2.4
of the NEB ﬁling manual3 (Table A-l), detailed information on speciﬁc biophysical or socio-
economic components should be considered for all phases of an applied project including
construction, operation, maintenance and abandonment. While the chemicals of potential
concern (COPCs) evaluated for the project included N02, PM2_5 and CO, there is no discussion
about other potential COPCs such as PAHs that may be associated with on-land vehicle exhaust.
The assessment also lacks information on releases of greenhouse gases associated with logging
and open burning during land clearing operations and compressor stations. HC advises that
events like facility and equipment failures should be considered in the worst case scenario in the
air dispersion model predictions. There are also several deﬁciency areas that require clariﬁcation
which are outlined in Table 1 below, including the need to justify the qualitative assessment of
N02, VOCs and 802.
With regards to noise, HC recommends that the noise assessment include noise from
construction of the pipeline and compressor. HC also advises that horizontal drilling noise and
non-continuous sources of noise (e.g. auxiliary power units) are included in the assessment.
Additional support is recommended for several conclusions made in the noise assessment, along
with the needs for clariﬁcation on statements made by the proponent regarding mitigation
speciﬁcations that have been incorporated in the noise modelling.
In terms of the NEB Possible Conditions for Comment], HC suggests an additional condition for
the Board’s consideration. The air quality assessment states that the manufacturer has committed
to meeting the air emissions of comparable compressor turbine units. HC advises that post-
implementation air quality monitoring be conducted to verify whether the proposed equipment
air emissions stay below the appropriate standards.
Thank you for providing HC with the opportunity to comment on the EIS and BSA for the 2017
NGTL System Expansion. If you have any questions regarding HC’s response or if you identify
any other speciﬁc human health concerns with respect to this project on which you would like to

Table 1: BC Comments on the EIS for 2017 NGT L System Expansion
HC - 1 Air Quality ESA, Section 6.4.2, The ESA Appendix 4, Section 3 states that concentrations of $02 and VOCs are not expected to
Page 6-59 result in long-term increases within the Air Quality RSA and therefore assessed qualitatively.
ES A Appendix 4 HC recommends including a rationale for only completing a qualitative assessment, including the
Section 3 0 Page 10 data supporting the assumptions that emissions of $02, VOCs and PM are negligible during the
' ' construction phase. This may take the form of previous assessments done for a similar project,
which show these emissions to be minor, or it may come from other data or literature sources.
ESA Appendix 4 states that 802 should not be emitted during the operations phase since the
available fuel gas composition shows very low sulphur content. However, sweet natural gas will
be compressed at the compressor stations and fired by the combustion equipment (e.g. boilers);
burning gas with very low sulphur content will still generate 802. Also, Table A4 in Appendix A
does not show the sulphur content (% mol) to support the statement that 802 will not be emitted
and should be corrected to specify the exact sulphur content of the gas. Therefore HC suggests
revising this assertion to clearly indicate the source of the low sulphur fuel, and the proportion of
equipment using sweet natural gas versus diesel (which results in greater 802 emissions) to
provide a more quantitative prediction of construction emissions of $02 and hence related human
health effects. HC also recommends that the proponent indicate how they will monitor 802
emissions during operation.
Regarding VOCs, it would be pertinent to have more precision in terms of volumes generated in
the past for this type of project. The assessment states: “that since VOC emissions constitute a
small portion of vented gas, approximately 8%, and given the historic venting volumes, VOC
emissions were considered to be negligible.” The statement “historic venting volumes” does not
provide a basis for comparison and does not indicate what impacts the current amount of VOC
releases may have. Therefore, more information is required to support the assertion that VOC
emissions are negligible and that they will not contribute to increasing the risks to human health.

HC - 2 Air Quality ESA, Appendix 4, Quantitative air dispersion modelling was not conducted for the construction phase of the
Section 2.1, Page 5 pipeline or compressor stations. It is good practice to provide data to support assumptions (e.g.
ES A Appendix 4 only small detectable quantities of CO and NOx; infrequent use of large diesel-operated
Section 3 5 1 Page equipment), therefore reference to assessments of similar projects or other such data would be
14 ' ' ’ useful. It would be expected that the emission profiles between the construction and operation
, phases would be sufficiently different to justify and expect that both phases be assessed
separately. For example, there may be more vehicle activity during construction and potentiall
more particulate matter, dust concentrations and NOx in the vicinity of the project that could
reach levels associated with potential health risks.
For the decommissioning phase, quantitative assessments on similar projects should also be
provided to support the assumption of minimal emissions in the EA. It is mentioned that the
activities of this phase are similar to the construction activities and are also short-term in nature.
Therefore, it would be beneficial to identify the duration of the decommissioning activities and the
measures which may be incorporated to monitor and control particulate matter (PM) and other
emissions generated from heavy machinery during demolition.
HC - 3 Air Quality ESA, Section 6.4.2, The application does not provide information on project’s contribution to regional ozon
Page 6-59 formation. HC recommends that the proponent should at the very least qualitatively characterize
ES A Appendix 4 the potential for ozone formation by including a discussion of the NOxNOCs balance in the area
Section 3 0 Page 10 and what the expected direction of ozone formation would be as a result of changes to NOx/NOZ
' ’ and other precursors during construction and operation phases.

HC- 4 Air Quality ESA, Section 6.4.3, The Government of Canada is in the process of establishing Canadian Ambient Air Quality
, . Page 6-60 Standards (CAAQS), which will replace the outdated National Air Quality Objectives (NAAQO). It
is expected that the CAAQS will be substantially more stringent than the NAAQO. HC supports
ESA, Appendix 4, the use of the US EPA 1-hour NAAQS for N02 (188 pg/m3) because it is based on a more
Section 3.1, Page 10 current database similar to that being used in the CAAQS process.
The new CAAQS for N02 also recognizes that there is no population health threshold for human
health effects; therefore, any increase in exposure will result in an incremental population risk."’5
In other words, N02 is considered to be a non-threshold substance, meaning that health effects
may occur at any level of exposure. As well, PM2.5 has no population health threshold for human
health effects. Therefore, guideline values should not be construed as limits to which polluting
up to is allowed. It should be acknowledgeable that health risks exist below the guidelines. In
addition, the principles of keeping clean areas clean and continuous improvement are operative,
thus proposed mitigation measures should not be confined to meeting the standards, but should
also be targeted towards reducing population exposure to CACs associated with the proposed
project.
HC suggests that PM10 be included in the assessment as associations have been observed
between ambient levels of PM10 and a range of health outcomes. PM10 is also considered a non-
threshold substance, as health effects may occur at any level of exposure.

HC - 5 Air Quality ESA, Appendix 4, The assessment notes that brief episodes of high ambient air concentrations of particulate matter
Section 3.5.1, Page is likely to occur in close vicinity to project construction activities which is stated to be common to
14 any typical construction activity. The assessment notes that these elevated dust levels will
decrease rapidly with distance due to gravitation settling and will likely decrease to background
levels within a few hundred metres and would not occur at sensitive receptors. HC is of the
opinion that data supporting these conclusions be provided, including an assessment of elevated
dust levels and the distance of release. The assessment should include the predicted COPC
concentrations for the maximally exposed population, for the most sensitive receptors, and at the
point of maximum impingement. As PM2,5 has both long-term and short-term health impacts and
has no population health threshold for human health effects, it is imperative that the 24-hour
CAAQS for PM2_5 be adhered to.
H0 — 6 Air Quality ESA, Appendix 4, It is important to clearly describe the location and distance from the project site(s) to all potential
Section 3.4.1 human receptors (permanent, seasonal or temporary) with their respective number of people;
taking into consideration the different types of land uses (e.g. residential, recreational, industrial
etc.); and identifying all sensitive people (e.g. schools, hospitals, retirement complexes 0
assisted care homes, aboriginal places of worship). The types of residents and visitors in a
particular area will depend on land use, and may include members of the general public and/o
members of specific population subgroups (Aboriginal peoples, campers, hunters, etc.). HC
recommends that this information be specified in the assessment, as it is not currently provided.
HC — 7 Air Quality ESA, Appendix 4, Events like facility and equipment failures can lead to increased concentrations of pollutants in
Section 3.5.4 the air. It may be informative in terms of “worst-case scenario” to include these possible events in
the air dispersion model predictions.
HC - 8 Air Quality ESA, Appendix 4, The COPCs evaluated for the project included N02, PM2_5 and CO. There is no discussion about
Section 3.1 other potential COPCs such as PAHs which may be associated with on-land vehicle exhaust. HC
advises that these additional COPCs be evaluated.
HC - 9 Air Quality ESA, Appendix 4, With regards to background concentrations, PAHs were not measured. Excluding PAHs (e.g.
Section 3.2 benzo(a)pyrene) from monitoring measurements could underestimate population exposure and
risk during the construction and operations phases.

HC -10 Air Quality ESA, Appendix 4, It is expected that during construction of the pipelines and compressor stations, there will be
Section 3.1 emissions of greenhouse gases associated with logging and open burning during land clearing
operations. These activities could also represent a potentially significant source of PM and NOx.
It is HC’s view that these emissions be addressed, as they are not currently considered in the
assessment.
HC - 1 1 Air Quality ESA, Appendix 4, The assessment states that the manufacturer has committed to meeting the air emissions of
Section 3.5.4, Page comparable compressor turbine units. HC advises that air quality monitoring be conducted to
16 help verify whether the proposed equipment air emissions stay below the standards.
HC recommends that this foliow-up air quality monitoring be considered as a condition in the
NEB List of Conditions.1
HC - 12 Noise ESA Appendix 5, The assessment states that since construction will be temporary and short-term in nature, noise
Section 4.4, Page 14 from construction was omitted from the noise modelling. HC strongly advises that the proponent
model construction noise, as the assessment states that it anticipates that many of the activities
during construction will result in short-term sound levels that may be higher than 50 dBA during
the daytime at 1.5 km from the site. Depending on whether the construction noise is actually
short term (i.e. < 1 year), these noise levels will likely exceed a measured noise level (MNL) of
47 dBA (not short term) and may exceed the preferred MNL of 57 dBA (short term). This is
consistent with concerns from elevated noise levels during construction from Doig River First
Nation.6
HC - 13 Noise ESA, Section 6.6.2, Horizontal directional drilling is expected to occur 24 hours per day. However, in the noise
Page 6-71 assessment, horizontal drilling noise was not considered because it is considered short-term in
nature compared to the total duration of the project construction phase. It is HC’s opinion that
even in a short term exposure scenario (i.e., less than 2 months), it is reasonable to expect
widespread complaints in a normally quiet rural area, if the day-night sound level (Ldn) of the
project noise exposure is greater than 57 dBA.7’8 The assessment provides no indication of the
noise level, nor the duration of the “short term” exposure for there to be a reasonable
consideration of the proponent’s conclusion, regardless of the criterion used. Thus, HC suggests
that horizontal drilling noise be included in the noise assessment.

HC - 14 Noise ESA, Section 6.6.2, HC recommends that noise be calculated for receptors in the vicinity of the pipeline sections, as
Page 6-71 they are not currently considered. As stated in the assessment, a total of 15 residences were
identified within 1 km of the Bear Canyon Section, 50 residences were identified within 1 km of
the McLeod River Section and two trapper cabins located less than 1 km from the Pelican Lake
Sections.
HC — 15 Noise ESA, Appendix 5, The proponent states that the majority of acoustic emissions during normal operations will
Section 1.2, Page 3 originate from proposed compressor station operation, specifically turbo—compressor units,
primary power units, suction and discharge piping, ventilation fans, electric motors and cooling
bays. While the effects of these sources are audible nearby the site, the proponent notes that
due to their limited effect at 1.5 km, these sources were not modelled for noise. It is HC’s opinion
that the proponent should provide evidence to reasonably support the omission of these sources
from the modelling. ‘
HC - 16 Noise ESA, Appendix 5, Auxiliary power units (APUs) were not included as a noise source in the noise modelling because
Section 2.3, Page 6 only continuous noise sources were considered. HC recommends that non-continuous noise
sources such as impulsive and intermittent noise should be included in the noise modelling.
Planned and regular events can be a significant contribution to complaints or long term
annoyance and if they are an integral part of the project, they should be included. The AER
Directive considers events occurring more than four times per year to be Planned, as would be
planned maintenance or planned operational events such as blowdowns. If APUs are used in
such planned events, HC advises that they should be included in the noise modelling.
HC - 18 Noise ESA Appendix 5, The proponent has noted that they are committed to managing noise issues and responding
Section 4.6, Page 16 promptly to any noise complaints, as requirements in the AER Directive 038 for comprehensive
sound level monitoring at residential locations are complaint-driven.7 HC recommends clarifying
how noise-complaints will be addressed, including a description of a complaint resolution
process.
HC - 19 Noise ESA Appendix 5, The noise assessment concludes that "mitigation speciﬁcations have been incorporated in the
Section 5, Page 17 noise modelling”. HC notes that this appears to be a statement of methodology that was not
made earlier in the noise assessment and should be clarified by the proponent. With the addition
of more noise sources as suggested by HG, this may lead to higher noise values which may
warrant additional mitigation. Thus the feasibility of the statement may be difficult to judge withou:
the presentation of the unmitigated results. HC recommends that the proponent clarify the
mitigation specifications incorporated in the noise modelling.

Dear Ms. Young:
RE:     Hearing Order GH-002-2015 – NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd.
        2017 NGTL System Expansion Project
Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), a Commenter in the National Energy Board
(NEB) review of the NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (the Proponent) 2017 NGTL System
Expansion Project (the Project), provides this Letter of Comment as per Hearing Order GH-002-
2015, Procedural Update No.2, issued November 17, 2015. This letter includes advice and
recommendations related to species at risk, migratory birds, as well as information regarding
ECCC’s role in emergency response and management of pipeline accidents or malfunctions.
This letter also contains ECCC’s response to an information request (IR) issued by the NEB on
October 21, 2015.
ECCC’s review focused on portions of the Project Application, Environmental and Socio-
economic Assessment (ESA), as well as various intervenors’ Information Requests that were
related to ECCC’s mandate including; the protection of migratory birds as identified under the
Migratory Birds Convention Act (MCBA), the protection of species at risk as identified under the
federal Species at Risk Act (SARA), and the conservation of wetlands that provide habitat for
numerous species of migratory birds. Additional information regarding ECCC’s mandate is
found in Attachments A and B.
Expert Advice and Recommendations:
ECCC provides the following advice and recommendations with respect to our mandated
responsibilities regarding the environmental effects of the Project:
 Boreal Caribou Habitat
The Boundary Lake section of the pipeline will intersect critical habitat for the Chinchaga caribou
herd and the Pelican Lake section will intersect critical habitat for the East Side (ESAR) and
West Side Athabasca River (WSAR) herds.
                                           www.ec.gc.ca
 ECCC recognizes within Table 7.10-2: Mitigation for Wildlife and Wildlife Habitat (ESA Section
7, Exhibit B2-14), the Proponent’s commitment to “minimize clearing requirements within
caribou range by narrowing the width of the pipeline right-of-way to the extent practical by
utilizing shared workspace, avoid clearing large-diameter trees on the edge of the right-of-way
and minimize extra temporary workspace; where practical, locate temporary yards, camps and
lay-downs outside of caribou range; prepare a Caribou Habitat Restoration and Offset Measures
Plan (CHROMP) for the Project” and to “Implement measures listed in Habitat Loss/Alteration,
Access Management/Line-of-Sight and Barriers/Filters to Wildlife Movement”.
ECCC requests the opportunity to review and comment on the Caribou Habitat
Restoration and Offset Measures Plan. ECCC recommends that offsetting measures
occur within each of the project affected caribou ranges. ECCC recommends that offset
ratios be vigorous and functionally additive. Because restoration and offsetting activities
are limited by their success in implementation, effectiveness and delay (lag); offsets
ratios must be designed to ensure that critical habitat is effectively protected. ECCC
recommends a 4 hectare offset for every 1 hectare of critical habitat destroyed.
In Table 7.10-8: Residual Effects for Wildlife and Wildlife Habitat (ESA Section 7, Exhibit B2-14)
and in Table 8.11-18: Cumulative Effects for Wildlife and Wildlife Habitat (ESA Section 7, Exhibit
B2-14), the Proponent states that the Project effects and contribution to cumulative effects,
respectively, on boreal caribou in the Chinchaga, ESAR and WSAR ranges are not significant.
ECCC disagrees with this assessment. The Project will destroy critical habitat. It is ECCC’s
position that the Project’s contribution to direct and indirect effects on caribou is additive and
significant, and the additive cumulative effects of this Project with other past, proposed and
reasonably foreseeable activities is significant. Each of these caribou ranges are considerably
below the 65% undisturbed habitat threshold required for recovery and survival. The Chinchaga,
ESAR and WSAR ranges are 76, 81 and 69% disturbed, respectively, and are deemed
unsustainable (Recovery Strategy for the Woodland Caribou, Boreal Population, 20121). All
remaining habitat for these ranges is considered critical habitat until otherwise identified in a
provincial range plan. No range plans have been released to date. The Project will remove
critical habitat and there will be a considerable time lag before this habitat can be restored.
ECCC considers any direct or indirect destruction of boreal caribou critical habitat
significant and recommends that the ESA be amended to reflect this. The Proponent’s
response to NEB IR 1.13 (Exhibit B8-01) does not address these concerns.
 Migratory Birds
The Proponent has stated throughout the ESA that “The migratory bird nesting period occurs
between May 1 and August 10. The current construction schedule avoids activities within this
period. In the event that there are schedule changes and construction activities are planned
during the migratory bird nesting period, NGTL will consult with ECCC.” (e.g., 4.4.1.2
Construction Scheduling)
ECCC would like to clarify the Proponent’s statement by stating that modelled nest
record data identifies a high risk of encountering nesting birds between May 1 and
August 10 in the Project area. Outside of these dates, there is a moderate to low risk. If
an individual has knowledge of an active nest, at any time of the year, it must be
protected with a species appropriate buffer until the young have fledged. Please consult

Mitigation for Wildlife and Wildlife Habitat (ESA Section 7, Exhibit B2-14). Namely, that in the
event a Canadian toad or western toad breeding pond is discovered, the Proponent will:
     o discuss appropriate mitigation with Alberta Environment and Parks;
     o not mow/brush vegetation within wetland riparian (fringe) areas during operation;
     o obtain the appropriate permit in the event that amphibians may need to be moved off
          the construction footprint during construction; and
     o if an amphibian salvage from a breeding pond is required, contact the appropriate
          regulatory agency for permitting requirements and discuss the salvage plan with
          Alberta Environment and Parks prior to this activity.
NEB’s Request to a Federal Authority
This letter confirms ECCC’s receipt of the NEB’s IR pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Canadian
Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 dated October 21, 2015. The NEB requested:
confirmation that the contents of the Recovery Strategy for the Woodland Caribou are current
and accurate; any additional information with respect to the Chinchaga, ESAR and WSAR
caribou ranges that has been accumulated by ECCC subsequent to the Strategy’s publication;
and any additional information regarding species other than caribou that have been identified
pursuant to the Species at Risk Act.
The Recovery Strategy for Woodland Caribou, Boreal Population (the Strategy) was
published October 5, 2012 and remains valid. ECCC has not accumulated new
information regarding the Chinchaga, ESAR and WSAR caribou ranges since the
publication of the Strategy. Range plans for the Chinchaga, ESAR and WSAR have not
yet been completed. Range plans are the responsibilities of the provinces and the NEB is
advised to contact the Province of Alberta (Alberta Environment and Parks) in this
regard.
In previous sections of this letter, ECCC provides comments with respect to woodland
caribou and western toad. Project construction is proposed to take place during the
winter and as such will not affect active nests of any SARA-listed migratory bird species.
No critical habitat has been identified for SARA listed migratory bird species, nor for
plants, mammals other than caribou, nor herptiles in the Project area at the timing of this
letter.
Closing Comments
The foregoing comments are intended to provide expert advice to decision-makers and
information on federal legislative requirements to the Proponent but are not an
acknowledgement, permission, approval, authorization, or release of liability related to any
requirements to comply with federal or provincial statutes and regulations. Responsibility for
achieving regulatory compliance and cost effective risk and liability reduction lies solely with the
Project Proponent.
                                                                                                   3
 I trust these comments will assist the NEB in the review of the 2017 NGTL System Expansion
Project. lf you have any questions or require clarification, please contact Matthew Boeckner by

                               Relevant Sections of ECCC’s Mandate
1. Species at Risk
SARA is directed towards preventing wildlife species from becoming extinct or lost from the wild,
helping in the recovery of species that are at risk as a result of human activities, and promoting
stewardship. SARA prohibits the killing, harming or harassing of listed species; the damage and
destruction of their residences; and the destruction of critical habitat. The prohibitions apply to
all Threatened, Endangered and Extirpated species listed on Schedule 1 of SARA on federal
lands. The prohibitions apply only to migratory birds (under the MBCA) and aquatic species
(under the Fisheries Act) on lands that are not federal lands, unless an Order is made pursuant
to SARA.
Subsection 79(2) of SARA requires that, where a federal environmental assessment is being
carried out in relation to a project that may affect a listed wildlife species or its critical habitat,
the person responsible for ensuring the assessment is conducted must identify potential
adverse effects on the listed wildlife species and its critical habitat; and if the project is carried
out: ensure that measures are taken to avoid or lessen those adverse effects and to monitor
them, and ensure that such measures are consistent with any applicable recovery strategy and
action plans.
Critical habitat as identified under SARA is that habitat necessary for the survival or recovery of
a species and has been identified for Boreal Woodland Caribou in the Recovery
Strategy. Section 58 of SARA prohibits the destruction of any part of the critical habitat of any
listed endangered or threatened species on federal lands, and any listed aquatic species or
migratory birds anywhere in Canada. The intent is for provinces and territories to provide
effective protection for those portions of critical habitat that occur on non-federal lands. If there
are situations where critical habitat is considered/determined to be not effectively protected,
SARA (ss. 61(4)) requires that the Minister of the Environment recommend to the Governor in
Council an order protecting that habitat.
2. Migratory Birds
Section 6 of the MBR prohibits the disturbance, destruction, or taking of a nest, egg or nest
shelter of a migratory bird. Possession of a migratory bird, nest or egg without lawful excuse is
also prohibited. Section 5.1 of the Act prohibits the deposition of substances harmful to
migratory birds in waters or areas frequented by migratory birds or in a place from which the
substance may enter such waters or such an area.
Regulations pursuant to the MBCA provide for the conservation of migratory birds and the
protection of their nests and eggs. Section 5 of the Migratory Bird Regulations (MBR) prohibits
the hunting of a migratory bird except under authority of a permit, where hunt means “chase,
pursue, worry, follow after or on the trail of, lie in wait for, or attempt in any manner to capture,
kill, injure or harass a migratory bird, whether or not the migratory bird is captured, killed or
injured”.
3. Wetlands
The Federal Policy on Wetland Conservation promotes the wise use of wetlands. The objective
of the Policy is to promote the conservation of Canada’s wetlands to sustain their ecological and
socio-economic functions, now and into the future. The Policy goals promote the maintenance
of the functions and values derived from wetlands throughout Canada, recognition of wetland
                                                                                                     6
 functions in resource planning and economic decisions, enhancement and rehabilitation of
wetlands in areas where continuing loss or degradation of wetlands or their functions have
reached critical levels, and utilization of wetlands in a manner that enhances prospects for their
sustained and productive use by future generations.
4. Emergency Response and Management
A pipeline accident or malfunction causing a spill could result in the release of deleterious
substances to receiving waters. The responsibility for the administration (including the
enforcement) of the pollution prevention provisions of the Fisheries Act (including subsection
36(3)) has been assigned to the Federal Minister of the Environment and Climate Change.
Subsection 36(3) of the Fisheries Act specifies that, unless authorized by federal regulation, no
person shall deposit or permit the deposit of deleterious substances of any type in water
frequented by fish, or in any place under any conditions where the deleterious substance, or any
other deleterious substance that results from the deposit of the deleterious substance, may
enter any such water. In general, any substance with a potentially harmful chemical, physical or
biological effect on fish or fish habitat may be considered deleterious. The act of depositing a
deleterious substance should be considered a violation of the Fisheries Act, regardless of
whether the water itself is made deleterious by the deposit. Subsection 36(3) of the Fisheries
Act makes no allowance for a mixing or dilution zone.
Through legislation, such as the Department of the Environment Act, Canadian Environmental
Assessment Act, 2012 (CEAA 2012), the Fisheries Act, and the MBCA and, subject to various
interagency agreements, ECCC is mandated to see that the environment is appropriately
protected in the event of an environmental emergency. Additional information on the scientific
advice and support that ECCC’s Environmental Emergencies Program can provide to Lead
Agencies in the event of a pipeline accident or malfunction is in the attached document “ECCC’s
Support Services for Pipeline Accidents and Malfunctions”.
                                                                                                7
                                           Attachment B
              ECCC’s Support Services for Pipeline Accidents and Malfunctions
In the event of an environmental emergency, ECCC’s Environmental Emergencies Program
efforts are aimed at reducing the consequence to the environment and human life or health. In
addition to the Department of the Environment Act, the key Acts that govern ECCC’s role in
environmental emergencies and that allow it to deliver its mandate are listed below:
 Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999
 Fisheries Act – Pollution Prevention Provisions
 Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994
Environmental emergencies (such as spills and other pollution incidents) need strong
leadership, clear communication and decision-making processes, as well as role clarity for their
successful management and quick resolution. For these reasons, ECCC employs the concept of
Lead Agency and Resource Agency. The Lead Agency is generally described as the
governmental authority that regulates or has legislative authority over the management of an
incident. The Lead Agency model helps all agencies involved in response efforts to organize
their actions in a coordinated fashion. The concept is flexible and adaptable according to the
source of pollution, the circumstances of the incident and the capacity of the different agencies
involved to assume this function. It should be noted that the Lead Agency can change during
the course of an incident. Regardless of which government department assumes the role of
Lead Agency, ECCC will assume the role of Resource Agency and provide its scientific and
technical expert support services to all partners that have requested it and where ECCC’s
support can enhance the protection of the environment. For cross-jurisdictional pipeline
incidents in Canada, the Lead Agency is the National Energy Board (NEB).
ECCC fulfills its Resource Agency role supporting Lead Agencies from its National
Environmental Emergencies Centre (NEEC) located in Montreal, Quebec. NEEC personnel are
available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to provide to responders and other implicated agencies
scientific and technical advice such as:
 spilled material properties, fate and behaviour analysis, hydrologic spill trajectory modelling,
    atmospheric transport and dispersion modeling, spill clean-up priorities and spill
    countermeasures (including spill treating agents);
 meteorological, sea-state and ice forecasts and warnings;
 scientific support team with personnel trained in emergency response and utilizing
    specialized equipment (portable instruments and mobile laboratories);
 identification of environmental sensitivities, areas and priorities;
 deterrence strategies to keep migratory birds from becoming oiled, and determining
    appropriate response for the humane treatment of captured birds and ‘species at risk’;
 priority assessment for shoreline protection and cleanup using the Shoreline Cleanup and
    Assessment Technique (SCAT);
 evaluation of spill countermeasures, containment, recovery, treatment and disposal
    techniques; and
 post-emergency analyses and providing advice on ecosystem recovery objectives.
NEEC personnel typically provide scientific and technical advice to lead agencies via telephone;
however, they can also travel to incident scenes and provide their services on-site when:
 the Lead Agency or any other organization having authority requests NEEC’s presence on-
    site;
                                                                                                 8
     remotely available information does not allow NEEC personnel to determine and monitor if
     the environment is being adequately protected;
    coordination and delivery of ECCC’s services would be enhanced by NEEC’s on-site
     response presence; or
    on-site response would fulfill specific training needs for NEEC personnel.
In fulfilling this advisory role, NEEC personnel work closely with scientists from other ECCC
programs and branches such as the Canadian Wildlife Service and the Meteorological Service
of Canada. They also collaborate with personnel from key partners such as the Canadian Coast
Guard, Transport Canada, Health Canada, Public Safety Canada, Fisheries and Oceans
Canada, and provincial/territorial departments of environment.
NEEC’S Environmental Emergencies Officers (EEO) are designated as enforcement officers
with limited enforcement powers and limited Peace Officer powers specific to CEPA, 1999, and
also as Inspectors under the Fisheries Act. If the responsible party fails to take appropriate
actions as required by these Acts, EEOs have the authority to direct the person to take those
measures, or to take the remedial measures so that the environment is appropriately protected
and adverse effects of an environmental emergency are mitigated, if required.
If a pipeline incident results in a spill into a marine environment, ECCC can play a front-line role
in the early detection of such spills through aerial surveillance and satellite imagery (a
collaborative program between ECCC and Transport Canada), thus enabling a more rapid and
effective incident response effort. During the response to an environmental emergency requiring
multi-agency cooperation, an Environmental Emergencies Science Table (Science Table) can
be convened by NEEC to provide response advice to the Lead Agency.
The Science Table is not a spill response organization in that it does not involve hands-on spill
clean-up operations, nor does it own or maintain clean-up equipment; rather, it is an advisory
mechanism that brings together relevant scientific and technical experts in the field of
environmental protection in the event of an environmental emergency response. The
participants to any given Science Table can be comprised of representatives from all levels of
government, Aboriginal representatives, local communities, industries, environmental non-
government organizations, and academic institutions, provided that they have relevant scientific
and technical expertise or jurisdiction over the response effort.
ECCC can convene and chair the Science Table when requested by the Lead Agency and
when at least one of the following criteria is met:
 the environmental emergency is major in terms of impacts/potential impacts on the
     environment and/or complexity/severity;
 the incident has an international or cross-jurisdictional component; or
 the need to coordinate information impedes the Lead Agency from fulfilling its response
     monitoring role.
The Science Table brings the necessary expertise together specific to the incident at hand,
develops a consensus on protection and clean-up priorities, adapts the scale of response to a
particular environmental emergency, and provides a forum for rapidly moving information to
minimize damage to human life or health, or the environment; all while maximizing the use of
limited response resources. These discussions can occur on-site, or by telephone or
videoconference.
                                                                                                   9
 The Science Table then supplies the Lead Agency with consolidated scientific and technical
advice pertaining to environmental concerns, priorities and strategies, thus enabling and
optimizing the environmental response. It is a flexible process and is designed to work in
emergency management structures such as the Incident Command System.
                                                                                        10
