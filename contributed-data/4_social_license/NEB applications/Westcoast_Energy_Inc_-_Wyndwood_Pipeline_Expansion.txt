Black Swan Energy is a Calgary based private energy company backed by CPPIB, Warburg Pincus and Azimuth
Capital Management, with $850 million of committed equity capital. We are focused on liquids rich Montney
gas in northeast British Columbia and hold a substantial, contiguous position in the Aitken Creek area with
over 341 sections and approximately 78 Tcf OGIP and 16 – 44 Tcfe recoverable resources. The infrastructure
and transportation currently available in the area is insufficient to handle increased volumes of gas of this
magnitude which has impacted the rate at which we are developing our lands and investing in our asset. Our
results have been positive and if sufficient infrastructure were to be in place to handle more volumes we
could and would accelerate our drilling program. Spudding our first well in Q4 2012, Black Swan has drilled 52
 Montney horizontal wells to date, and we are currently producing 85 MMcf/d through regional facilities. We
produce 50 MMcf/d through the 100% owned and operated Black Swan Aitken Creek North Gas Plant which
will be expanded to 110 MMcf/d by mid-2017, and the remaining gas, approximately 35 MMcf/d, flows
through the Westcoast Energy Inc. McMahon Gas Processing Plant. Black Swan continues to leverage the
scale of its assets to make commitments to take on incremental long term firm processing and transportation
capacity commitments. The timing of the Wyndwood Expansion project is imperative to our business plan as
no incremental firm egress is available to us on the Spectra Fort St. John T-North system. As an existing T-
North shipper with committed volumes on this project, Black Swan supports the proposal by Westcoast
Energy Inc. for the Wyndwood Pipeline Expansion as outlined in this application, and we intend to monitor
the proceeding.
