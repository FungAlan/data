Dear Madam,
I am writing regarding Enbridge‘s proposed Line 9 Reversal (A30643) ﬁled with the
National Energy Board in August.
I do not believe that the request for 3 facilities exemption order is appropriate for
this project, and urge the NEB to instead require Enbridge to provide a more
detailed application and to hold public hearings on the proposal.
I am concerned that the project would increase the amount of tar sands oil in
Ontario, which creates more greehhouse gas emissions than conventional oil and is
more corrosive and dangerous to tranSport. It would also threaten Ontario's energy
security by limiting our sources of oil.
Please urge the NEB to use its regulatory authority to ensure a transparent,
comprehensive review of the proposed pipeline reversal that considers the interests
of ﬁrst Nations, the environment, landowners and the public.
I look forward to your reply at your earliest convenience. Thank-you for your kind
attention.

Re. Enbridge Line 9 Reversal Phase ‘1 Project

Dear Me. Erickson: ' ‘

I represent The Tutela Heights Phelps Road Residents Association, a group of residents from Brant
County committed to supporting local food & healthy communities, fostering integrated rural/urban
planning, protecting prime farmland & preventing urban sprawl.

Brant County is just downstream of Line 9.

We have become made aware of the proposal by Enbridge to reverse the ﬂow of oil in Line 9. and to
operate the pipeline at higher pressures with potentially more acidic and corrosive materials flowing
through it. Given the companys recent history of spills. in particular the Kalamazoo River spill in
Michigan, we believe that this proposal warrants the disclosure of more information to the public,
including an independent assessment of pipeline safety with regards to Line 9 in particular. These issues

- are all of critical interest to our members and to residents of Brant County.
We are thetefore concerned that Enbridge has applied for this project in such a manner to limit public
participation by applying for an exemption under section 58 of the National Energy Board Act. and call
upon the National Energy Board to instead ensure a full consideration of all the issues through a robust
process, including public hearings.

Dear Ms. Erickson:
Re: Line 9 Reversal - Phase 1 Project (A30643)
The Conservation Law Foundation was founded in 1966 to use law, science, policy making and the
business market to ﬁnd pragmatic, innovative solutions to New Engia nd‘s toughest environmental
problems. Among the iss ues we focus on is the need to meet our region’s energy needs in ways that do
not contribute to environmental pollution and climate change. To that end, we submit these brief
comments on Enbridge's August 8, 2011 application to reverse a portion of Line 9 In Ontario.
Recent media reports have indicated that Enbridge is holding talks with the Portland-Montreal Pipe Line
company to bring all in an Easterly direction to the port in Portland, Maine. These intentions are not
currently reﬂected in Enbridge's disclosure documents now befou'e the National Energy Board, thereby
precluding pro per regulatory and public oversight. We also question the compa ny's modelling of
conventional crude types in the reversed pipeline should the true Intention be to continue on to
Portland for export, which stro ngly implies the the cwde types are likely to be diluted bitumen, derived
from oil sands. As you should be aware, tar sands oil is a heavy crude that is signiﬁca ntiy more acidic
and corrosive than standard oil. Pu mping it at a high temperature and high pressure for long dista nces
Is a risky proposition at best and exposes the environment along the current route of the Portiand-
Montreal pipeline to unnecessary risk.
We therefore call upon the Board to not grant Enbridge an exemption under section 58 of the Mariana!
Energy Board Act, and instead require the company to make full disclosures of its plans and to su bject
those pia ns to a transparent evaluation and thorough public hearings.
Very truly you rs,

“mm m9 1) e Boar s on d guard against project Spt mg
In 2008, Enbridge had indicated clear public intention to build the Trailbreaker pipeline,
transporting oil sands products from Alberta, throughChicago, southern Ontario, and
ultimately, to Maine. The ﬁrst step in this process would have been to reverse Line 9.1
The Line 9 reversal is precisety the nature of this application.
In its application, Enbridge has indicated that this project is being undertaken to ”meet
business demands ofshippers", but little detail is provided beyond this statement. Given
that there is increasing concern about pipeline practices, safety, and risk, we are of the
view that pipeline projects, even those that utilize existing infrastructure, should be
evaluated in as thorough and transparent a manner as possible.
We note that the Board has addressed the matter of "project splitting” in other
circumsta nces to ensure that the Board’s review of proposed activities is fulsome and i
appropriate. For example, in the Sumas 2 case, the proponent power company sought to i
sever a power plant located just south of the Canadian border from a project to bring
power from that power plant to a Canadian substation. The Board held that the potential

enviro nmentai effects from the power plant were to be considered in its decision
regarding the project application.2 The Federal Court of Appeal upheld the Board’s
jurisdiction to consider the environmental impacts from the power plant and affirmed |
g that the Board must consider all the factors it considers releva nt.3
More recently, Nova Gas Transmission (NGTL) is seeking to expand its Alberta pipeline
: system by adding pipelines in remote northeast British Columbia and northwest
E I‘Jilberta.‘1 NGTL's application included 3 pipeline loops that would tie into its main i
pipeline system, which was also to be the subject of futu re regulatory approval I
L1- applications to the Board for its Northwest System Expa nsion Projects. This latter project
I: would see even more pipeline loops being built. In this case, the Board has required
NGTL to explain the relationship between ”the Project as described in the Project
3 Description and NGTL’s Northwest System Expansion Projects.”s
In requiring NGTL to provide additional information, the Board relied on The Canadian
Environmental Assessment Agency’s Operational Policy Statement, which states that:
i: ” projects shouid be grouped together or filed as distinct applications based
on their interrelatedness or distinctions from one another. Project components
may be considered connected actions, for instance, if any of the following are
true:
o where one is automatically triggered by another;
j . where one cannot proceed without the other; or
i o where both are part of a iarger whole and have, if considered separately, no
g; independent utility.”
! -
5 We request that the Boa rd exercise its jurisdiction to more fully evaluate this proposal,
as we are concerned that the Lin 9 reversal is really part of a larger whole, and may not
have any independent utility.

' 2) The Trailbreaker project would be fundamentally different from the
| . current approval
' Reversing the flow of a several hundred kilometer pipeline appears to indicate that the
~ commercial foundation for the pipeline is fundamentally different than that which was
i . previously approved. We are of the view that additional information as to why this 1
. : reversal is required should be considered as part of any Board reguiatory review, and we
' question whether Enbridge should be required to seek a section 52 certificate of public
' convenience and necessity for this project.
. Further, because Enbridge’s application is primarily framed as an application for an
exemption from the general approval provisions for co nstruction and operation of
s pipelines, we are particularly concerned that the broader implications of this proposal be
3 evaluated. As evidenced by the August 26, 2011 letter, there are reasons to be
5? concerned about any changes in activity around this pipeiine, both from a project
I splitting perspective, and, because of its age, about pipeline integrity.
3 This application should not be evaluated by way of regulatory exemption. Rather, the
scope of the review should be expanded considerably to fully evaluate the entire
; . proposed undertaking. We request that the Boa rd ask Enbridge to provide additional
information on the nature of the project and the need for the project.
We are of the view that Enbridge’s Line 9 reversal is of sufficient public interest as to
warrant an oral public hearing, and warrants an opportunity for interested parties,
concerned citizens and potentially affected la ndowners to make information requests,
file evidence, and participate in an oral hearing.

It has come to our attention that Enbridge Pipeline Inc. (‘Enbridge’) has embarked
on Phase 1 of the Line 9 Reversal, which will re-commission and reverse the ﬂow of oil
through Line 9 running from Sarnia to Westover.
Based on the information available to us at this time, we wish to inform you that we are
concerned about the project’s potential risks, implications and impacts on the lands,
waters, rights and interests of the Haudenosaunee. We respectfully request that the
National Energy Board (‘NEB’) uphold the honour of the crown and engage with the
Haudenosaunee who have treaty rights in the speciﬁed project area.
The Haudenosaunee Confederacy Chiefs Council (‘HCCC’) has legislated the
Haudenosaunee Development Institute (‘I-IDI’) to represent HCCC interests in the
development of lands within areas of Haudenosaunee jurisdiction, including but not
limited to the land prescribed by the Haldimand Proclamation and the 1701 Treaty Area.
HDI has established and administers a regulatory framework which identiﬁes, registers
and regulates deveIOpment in compliance with a number of regulatory obligations
including the Haudenosaunee Green P1an(‘I-IGP’) and the Haudenosaunee Deve10pment
Protocol (‘HDP’) which are attached.

HDI is also charged with ensuring that the perpetual care and maintenance of the
Haudenosaunee is maintained with respect to Haudenosaunee interests.
The pipeline ROW crosses the Grand River and is within the above-speciﬁed areas of
Haudenosaunee jurisdiction. The Crown and crown agencies have constructive
knowledge of the geographic extent of these treaty areas and the basis for the
Haudenosaunee’s assertion of root title, rights and interest within these areas. As such,
the HDI asserts that Enbridge’s Line 9 project has the potential to adversely impact upon
the established and asserted rights of the Haudenosaunee.
We understand that Enbridge has asked the NEB for permission to reverse the ﬂow of its
Line 9 oil pipeline, which currently carries oil from Montreal to Samia. Under this
application, Enbridge purports to ship conventional oil from Sarnia, across the Grand
River to storage facilities at Westover. We understand Enbridge could or may
subsequently opt to ship synthetic crude or oil sands oil through this line and could opt to
ship this synthetic crude to Montreal and into markets in Maine. We have several
concerns that relate to both substantive and procedural aspects of the project and
Enbridge’s application.
The community of Ohsweken is located on the banks of the Grand River located
immediately downstream of the Line 9 crossing. In addition to having interests in relation
to the ownership of and jurisdiction in relation to the Grand River, the Haudenosaunee of
Ohsweken rely on this river for a range of environmental, cultural, spiritual, socio-
economic purposes. Our community obtains its drinking water and potable water supplies
directly from the Grand River.
Based on available information, we understand that Bnbridge’s Line 9 is a relatively old
pipeline built in 1975 using polyethylene tape as a coating — the same material used in the
Enbridge pipeline that ruptured in Michigan last year, which investigators found to have
“surface cracks and indications of corrosion,” and the same material used in the Plains
Midstream pipeline which ruptured in Alberta this year.
Further, we understand that synthetic oil or oil sands oil can be more corrosive than
conventional crude oil. Also we understand that segments of the pipeline will also be
operated at higher pressures than the previous Operating levels. Both of these factors raise
our concerns about the risk of an accident, malfunction, leak, rupture or spill at any point
along the pipeline ROW, but speciﬁcally within the Grand River watershed
An oil spill within the Grand River watershed and the Grand River or one of its
tributaries could have severe impacts on the river, ﬁsh and ﬁsh habitat, our lands and our
peOple and the public’s ongoing use and dependency of the river.
The HDI is also aware that Enbridge formerly pr0posed a pipeline project — “The Trail
Breaker Project’, whose purpose was to transship synthetic or oil sands oil through to
Montreal and then onto Maine. In the application before the Board, we see a pr0posal to
ship conventional oil from Samia to Westover.

The HDI would be very concerned if Enbridge is merely seeking to avoid a more fulsome
and comprehensive environmental and socio—ec onomic impact review by attempting to
advance its overall goal and proj ect in increments. Given our concerns above, we believe
that Enbridge as a proponent, should be required to be forthcoming and disclose its full
plan for shipment of oil, rather than submitting an application for a pipeline from Samia
to Westover; a pipeline to nowhere. We believe that the N138 would share our concern
about the possibility of Enbridge project splitting with the goal of obtaining a more
Speedy and cost effective approval.
We note that section 17 of Ontario Regulation 359/00 of the Environmental Protection
Act sets out a number of obligations with respect to consultation with aboriginal
communities and while we take some issue having Haudenosaunee matters characterized
as ‘aboriginal’ we note that Enbridge has failed to meet the obligation required by the
Regulation. We would also take the position that the regulation and legislation does not
properly consider a process which is reﬂective of proven and established treaty rights
which must be considered in this matter.
We also note that only procedural and/or technical aspects of consultation can be
delegated by the Province of Ontario and while Regulation 359/00 appears to be such a
delegation, the delegation must occur in the context of an assessment of the rights and
interests which may be impacted upon. To date we have not been provided with any such
assessment from the Province of Ontario and we have not been provided with the
opportunity to understand how the Province of Ontario will address accommodation
matters if and when they are required.
We can also conﬁrm that the Haudenosaunee have treaty rights, in particular in the area
contemplated by your project, including but not limited to, the right to free and
undisturbed harvesting. As the proposed proj ect will have a negative impact upon those
treaty rights, the nature and seepe of engagement required is signiﬁcantly above and
beyond what is commonly referred to as “consultation.”
Clearly no process of engagement has occurred at all whereby the consultation,
accommodation and reconciliati on obligations of the Crown might be upheld. We
respectfully request that the NEB work with the HDI to require full disclosure of
Enbridge’s plans, to determine the adequate some and level of environmental and
regulatory review and to work out a reasonable process for engagement in relation to this
pipeline project and major undertaking.
We advise that Enbridge’s Line 9 project has the potential to adversely affect the
environment, our community and our rights and interests. We request that NEB uphold
the honour of the Crown and reconsider Enbridge’s exemption application and request
that all key parties be engaged in a discussion of these matters to determine the
apprOpriate scoping and timing for review and decision making.

Dear Ms. Erickson:
Re: Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project

Enbridge Pipelines Inc. '

(NEB Application No.: A30643)

Sarnia to Westover, Ontario
The Upper Thames River Conservation Authority (UTRCA) is in receipt of a letter (dated
September 9, 2011) ﬁ'om Chantal Robert of Enbridge requesting cements regarding the
Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project. We are also in receipt of the submitted
1etter(copy) sent from Environmental Defense to the National Energy Board (dated August 26,

. 2011) and the letter (copy) sent from yourself to Chantal Robert of Bnbridge Pipelines Inc.
(dated September 6, 2011). We appreciate this information being provided and wish to provide
the following comments on the role of the UTRCA regarding this project.

The UTRCA regulates development within the Regulation Limit in accordance with Ontario
Regulation 157/06 made pursuant to Section 28 of the Conservation Authorities Act. This
regulation requires pmponents to obtain written approval from the UTRCA prior to undertaking ‘
any works in the regulated area including ﬁlling, grading, construction, alteration to a
watercourse and/or interference with a wetiand. Following a preliminary review of the
Environmental and Socio-Economic Impact Assessment — Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project
prepared for Enbridge Pipeline Inc. by Stantec Consulting Ltd. (dated June 7, 2011) and
available for public viewing on the NEB website, it appears that there are no new constmction
works currently preposed to occur within the Regulation Limits Within the UTRCA watershed.
Through the UTRCA watershed, the project appears to consist solely of a pipeline reversal. The
proj ect, as currently proposed, does not therefore require a permit or approvals from the UTRCA
and would therefore not fall under our regulatory, permit or technical review process.

We note that as both watershed managets and as the owner of property in the watershed, we have
,an interest in the project as to implications on water quality. We trust that the federal regulations
in place respecting technical standards and safety for the transport of corrosive substances will be
addressed through project design and maintenance upgrades as needed. We would encourage the
NEB to ensure the regal atory process remains open and transparent and that a comprehensive
investigation and sufﬁcient technical review be undertaken to ensure the integrity of the pipeline
would not be compromised in the long term by the proposed change in use.
We appreciate, and encourage, inter—ageney and Non-Govemmental Organization (NGO)
communication related to projects in our watershed. Should you require clariﬁcation on any of
the above or have any further questions, please feel free to contact the undersigned.

Subject: Line 9 Reversal – Phase 1 Project (A30643)
Dear National Energy Board,
I am writing regarding Enbridge's proposed Line 9 Reversal (A30643) filed with the National
Energy Board in August.
I do not believe that the request for a facilities exemption order is appropriate for this
project, and urge the NEB to instead require Enbridge to provide a more detailed application
and to hold public hearings on the proposal.
I am concerned that the project would increase the amount of tar sands oil in Ontario, which
creates more greenhouse gas emissions than conventional oil and is more corrosive and
dangerous to transport. It would also threaten Ontario's energy security by limiting our
sources of oil.
Please use your regulatory authority to ensure a transparent, comprehensive review of the
proposed pipeline reversal that considers the interests of First Nations, landowners and the
public.

I am writing regarding Enbridge's proposed Line 9 Reversal (A30643) filed with the National
Energy Board in August.
I do not believe that the request for a facilities exemption order is appropriate for this
project, and urge the NEB to instead require Enbridge to provide a more detailed application
and to hold public hearings on the proposal.
I am concerned that the project would increase the amount of tar sands oil in Ontario, which
creates more greenhouse gas emissions than conventional oil and is more corrosive and
dangerous to transport. It would also threaten Ontario's energy security by limiting our
sources of oil.
Please use your regulatory authority to ensure a transparent, comprehensive review of the
proposed pipeline reversal that considers the interests of First Nations, landowners and the
public.

Dear Ms. Erickson:
Re: Line 9 Reversal - Phase 1 Project (A30643)
The Conservation Law Foundation was founded in 1966 to use law, science, policy making and the
business market to ﬁnd pragmatic, innovative solutions to New England's toughest environmental
problems. Among the issues we focus on is the need to meet our region’s energy needs in ways that do
not contribute to environmental pollution and climate change. To that end , we submit these brief
comments on Enbridge's August 8, 2011 application to reverse a portion of Line 9 in Ontario.
Recent media reports have indicated that Enbridge is holding talks with the Portland-Montreal Pipe Line
company to bring oil in an Easterly direction to the port in Portland, Maine. These intentions are not
currently reflected in Enbridge's disclosure documents now before the National Energy Board, thereby
precluding proper regulatory and public oversight. We also question the company's modelling of
conventional crude types in the reversed pipeline should the true intention be to continue on to
Portland for export, which strongly implies the the crude types are likely to be diluted bitumen, derived
from oil sands. As you should be aware, tar sands oil is a heavy crude that is signiﬁcantly more acidic
and corrosive than standard oil. Pumping it at a high temperature and high pressure for long distances
is a risky proposition at best and exposes the environment along the current'route of the Portland-
Montreal pipeline to unnecessary risk.
We therefore call upon the Board to not grant Enbridge an exemption under section 58 of the National
Energy Board Act, and instead require the company to make full disclosures of its plans and to subject
those plans to a transparent evaluation and thorough public hearings.
Very truly yours,
;€ Ix. NA—a

Subject: Line 9 Reversal – Phase 1 Project (A30643)
Dear National Energy Board,
I am writing regarding Enbridge's proposed Line 9 Reversal (A30643) filed with the National
Energy Board in August.
I do not believe that the request for a facilities exemption order is appropriate for this
project, and urge the NEB to instead require Enbridge to provide a more detailed application
and to hold public hearings on the proposal.
I am concerned that the project would increase the amount of tar sands oil in Ontario, which
creates more greenhouse gas emissions than conventional oil and is more corrosive and
dangerous to transport. It would also threaten Ontario's energy security by limiting our
sources of oil.
Please use your regulatory authority to ensure a transparent, comprehensive review of the
proposed pipeline reversal that considers the interests of First Nations, landowners and the
public.

dirty fuel that endangers people and the planet. A full environmental assessment of this

Subject: Line 9 Reversal – Phase 1 Project (A30643)
Dear National Energy Board,
I am writing regarding Enbridge's proposed Line 9 Reversal (A30643) filed with the National
Energy Board in August.
I do not believe that the request for a facilities exemption order is appropriate for this
project, and urge the NEB to instead require Enbridge to provide a more detailed application
and to hold public hearings on the proposal.
I am concerned that the project would increase the amount of tar sands oil in Ontario, which
creates more greenhouse gas emissions than conventional oil and is more corrosive and
dangerous to transport. It would also threaten Ontario's energy security by limiting our
sources of oil.
Please use your regulatory authority to ensure a transparent, comprehensive review of the
proposed pipeline reversal that considers the interests of First Nations, landowners and the
public.

Subject: Line 9 Reversal – Phase 1 Project (A30643)
Dear National Energy Board,
I am writing regarding Enbridge's proposed Line 9 Reversal (A30643) filed with the National
Energy Board in August.
I do not believe that the request for a facilities exemption order is appropriate for this
project, and urge the NEB to instead require Enbridge to provide a more detailed application
and to hold public hearings on the proposal.
I am concerned that the project would increase the amount of tar sands oil in Ontario, which
creates more greenhouse gas emissions than conventional oil and is more corrosive and
dangerous to transport. It would also threaten Ontario's energy security by limiting our
sources of oil.
Please use your regulatory authority to ensure a transparent, comprehensive review of the
proposed pipeline reversal that considers the interests of First Nations, landowners and the
public.

I do not believe that the request for a facilities exemption order is appropriate for this

Subject: Line 9 Reversal – Phase 1 Project (A30643)
Dear National Energy Board,
I am writing regarding Enbridge's proposed Line 9 Reversal (A30643) filed with the National
Energy Board in August.
I do not believe that the request for a facilities exemption order is appropriate for this
project, and urge the NEB to instead require Enbridge to provide a more detailed application
and to hold public hearings on the proposal.
I am concerned that the project would increase the amount of tar sands oil in Ontario, which
creates more greenhouse gas emissions than conventional oil and is more corrosive and
dangerous to transport. It would also threaten Ontario's energy security by limiting our
sources of oil.
Please use your regulatory authority to ensure a transparent, comprehensive review of the
proposed pipeline reversal that considers the interests of First Nations, landowners and the
public.

I live just west of the Keyser pumping station. Line 9 has been working for about 40 years. What I would like to know
is if the line pressure is about 900 PSI. What is the pressure just on the west side of the Keyser pumping station?
What happens to the pressure when the flow is reversed? Will the pressure be higher on the west side and if so, by
how much?
I have read in newspaper accounts that Enbridge has had a serious oil spill or spills in Michigan and this causes great
concern for me. I also understand that this line is thinner walled than Lines 7&8. Will an increase in pressure cause
cracks to appear or worsen the ones that may already be there?
 In Ontario, evironmental laws make the landowner liable for any pollution on his property. Therefore, I want to know
what is going through the pipe at all times and if Enbridge is willing or is not willing to give this information, why not?
 It is the responsiblity of the NEB to put above all else, the safe operation of these pipelines and it is my opinion that a
full hearing should be held so all the facts may come forward. Unfortunately, because the hearing process is so
expensive to take part in, many landowners would not be able to produce any evidence and be able to participate in a
hearing.
Yours truly,

Dear Sir/ Madam

I am replying to the application for the Enbridge Line reversal.

Let me start off that I am In a no win situation, if I do not reply Enbridge will say
that I am satisﬁed with their application, and if I do reply they will not answer any
relevant questions. but will tell the NEB that they have addressed landowner concerns.

In the past I have gone to information meetings were the Enbridge employees
either do not know the answers to questions or they would not give a deﬁnitive reply, but
they would tell me to leave a list of questions and they would get back to me. I am still
waiting for a reply from a meeting several years ago in Samia.

l have the following questions

What is the current condition of line 9, what are the current ﬂows and
pressures being used and what will be used

How much longer will the pipe be structurally sound to transport product,
and then what 7

When a ﬂuid continUally ﬂows one direction it creates a grain to the object
it is in, reversing the flow will make the ﬂuid 90 against the grain
which could compromise the integrity of the pipe.

Why does it seems that Enbridge always raises issues to be addressed by
land owners during spring planting and the fall harvest. They
conveniently arrange notiﬁcations and meetings during the busiest
times of the year for farmers.

Enbridge has shown a history of doing the bare minimum to appease rural land
owners, and has so far been allowed to do so. The sad part of the whole equation is
that the NEB has allowed such actions to occur, and has even help pass legislation
that greatly benefited the oil companies to the detriment of land owners and without
even notifying land owners.

Best regards Hugh Aerts qu\ {\(Jﬁ

Re.: Enbridge Pipeline (Enbridge) Line 9 Phase 1 Application

|

We are landowners of Lot 10 Concession 2 East Williams Township under the Lands
Patent Act. That address puts us in North Middlesex. We are writing to express both
our disagreement and our grave concerns regarding Enbridge’s application.
1. TRANSPARENCY
Our ﬁrst concern could come under transparency. It seems at the very least
strange that the ﬁrst letter from Enbridge to notify us of the application and comment
deadline never reached us. Doesn’t that seem ‘strange’ to those of you at the NEB as
well? A person might well wonder how hard Enbridge tried to get in touch with
landowners. You might wonder too. A person might go further and wonder whether
there is a lot more to ponder here.
2. INCREASED RISK
Our second concern would be the possibility of a spill either on our land or
affecting our land. The pipeline here is more than 35 years old. How long do these
pipelines last? Does anyone know? I think we can agree that line 9 is past middle
age but if the NEB approves this proposal the pressure this aging line sustains will be
raised and the amount of internal corrosion it will be subject to will also be increased.
Nor is all of the pipeline safely buried well below possible interference. We learned just
how shallow the pipeline can be when Enbridge were called in to supervise a dredging
of the drainage ditch on the southwestern side of our property more than a decade ago.
Before machinery ever began its work it was evident that part of the pipeline was
already exposed and had been for 20 years or so. At first the Enbridge representative
seemed to accuse the equipment operator, who had done no digging, of exposing the
pipe but soon reluctantly conceded that the pipeline had not been properly buried
during its initial construction. We as land owners, our neighbours and all users of the
water shed were lucky over the years that a falling tree or cow did not damage that
pipe.

2‘

You cannot assume, despite strategic depth studies by Enbridge that all parts of the

pipeline are at or below the proscribed depths. When Enbridge was doing this

“investigative dig” we asked for a copy of the results for our own land but we have never

received this. Nor do we even know if the depths have been checked on our land.

Adding new stresses by reversing Line 9 would add to the risk of a pipeline leak.

3. CONSEQUENCES

Let us lay out for you some of the possible consequences of a leak or spill on

even our one small parcel of land.

The shallowest part of the pipeline on our property crosses a small drainage ditch that

runs directly into the Ausable River. Our land is in the headwaters of the Ausable

River. The Auasable runs into Lake Huron where there are intake pipes for drinking

water for municipalities as far away as London. The consequences of a leak here go I

far beyond our own land.

The consequences of any leak or pipe rupture would, of course, impact our property

much more directly. The woodland in the back south east of our property has been
' designated part of Signiﬁcant Middlesex Natural Heritage. To achieve this designation

the woods here passed through a rigorous study of the number of native and heritage

trees measured against weedy and invasive species. That woods is part of a corridor

remnant of forest crucial to the survival or many bird species. Southwestern Ontario

remaining woodlands are under multiple threats right now, with Ashes, Elms and

Hickories undergoing near extinction. Any leak would push the trees in our woodland

closer to the edge.

However, before it got to our ‘signiﬁcant woodland’ any leak would roll over a newly

installed wetland habitat. the Sanders Westland Restoration Project designed by

Ausable Bayfield Conservation Authority’s wetland expert Angela Van Niekirk,

completed in September 2011 and approved and partnered by other agencies among

them Ducks Unlimited. Ducks Unlimited would not have been involved in our wetland

project unless they thought this was a sustainable habitat, which it will be so long as an

aging pipeline doesn’t spring a leak. ‘
l 4. LIABILITY

Perhaps, though, out biggest concern is our potential liability as landowners.

The NEB has said we have “some” liability. What does that mean? And why should

we have any liability? We did not ask for a pipeline. We do not directly beneﬁt from

the pipelines. We live under a risk we never willingly assumed. We understand how

pipelines benefit all Canadians. We are not against pipelines. But we need far more

assurances from Enbridge and the NEB that the proposed Line 9 Reversal is safe,

rigorously monitored and that in case of accident we are protected from liability.

We hope that the National Energy Board takes seriously the need to protect ordinary

landowners like us. You must strike a fair balance between energy needs, the need for

3
proﬁt and the needs of people like us. We have to count on you to very critically study
this proposal for a Line 9 Reversal . If the stakes are so high for one very small parcel
of land, think of all the much bigger landowners who will be under much greater risk if
this proposal is accepted as is.

Dear Ms. Erickson; Re: Enbridge Line 9 Reversal Application
To The National Energy Board:
Re: Proposed Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project (A30643)
My name is Stuart O’Neil and my wife and I do not believe the above project
should be granted an exemption from a detailed and thorough assessment and hearing.
We own a 100 acre farm in London Twp., Ontario, located just 6 miles north of
the city of London. We have three Enbridge pipelines. Our land was expropriated in
Sept. 1985 for line 9 construction. Some of our questions, concerns and suggestions
are listed below:
1. Line 9 is 36 years old.
2. Line 9 has thinner pipe than Line 7 or Line 8. Line 9 may be carrying a more
corrosive crude oil. Why use thinner pipe?
3. If in fact Line 9 might eventually be transporting “sour” fuel inputs perhaps to the
Sarnia reﬁnery, and that sour fuel inputs means signiﬁcant increase in H28
concentrations, I believe that the atmosphere in Sarnia and indeed downwind from
Sarnia will suffer. Sarnia is surrounded by Great Lakes. An independent assessment
should determine any prospective change in air quality using a detailed risk assessment
process.
4. Line 9 has a polyethylene tape coating. This type of coating was thoroughly
examined in 1995 NEB “Stress Corrosion cracking NEB Hearing”. As Ontario Pipeline
Landowners President, myself and Margaret Vance were given intervener status. We
did not introduce any evidence because of costs, but we did examine much of the
evidence of experts hired by CEPA and the NEB. We were allowed to ask very pointed
questions to them via interrogators questions. The NEB judges were thorough. We need
the same quality of expert independent judges for a full NEB inquiry to-day. The 1995
ﬁnal NEB report entitled “Inquiry of Stress Corrosion Cracking on Canadian Oil and Gas
Pipelines”, was very direct. In the report on Page 24, CEPA (Canadian Energy Pipeline
Association) evidence submitted indicates that: “SCC or Stress Corrosion Cracking had
been found approximately 4 times more often on pipe coated with polyethylene tape as
on asphalt and coal enamel coated pipe.” Figure 3.7 on Page 23 of NEB report
indicates that polyethylene tape coating was only used from 1960 to 1980 and was then
discontinued. Why?

-2-
5. SCC is of course a major cause of pipeline failure. Thus a pipeline coated with
polyethylene tape, is in my opinion is a much greater liability to the pipeline landowner.
There have been 2 Enbridge pipeline ruptures, one in Michigan and one in Alberta,
within the last 2 years. Both pipelines were coated with polyethylene wrapping.
6. In Ontario, approximately thirty years ago, legislation was passed by our Ontario
government that any landowner is responsible for any substance released from the
property, even if the owner did not in any way cause the release or spill. Thus if a
custom spray crop operator who is spraying for my tenant farmer has a spill, l the owner
can be charged with the offense. Similarly, I can be charged if crude oil leaks off our
farm from a leaking or ruptured Line 9. We have tile drains just outside the pipeline
easement which feed into a municipal drain (of Middlesex Centre) of which drains into
the Thames River, one of the largest watersheds in South Western Ontario. Would the
Municipality of London Centre also be charged because the municipal drain actually
joins the Thames River? Our farm could be like owning several abandoned gasoline
stations. If the above scenario could ever be true, why would anyone want to purchase
my farm, or any other similar farms from Sarnia to Montreal. It is very probable that
charted banks would not hold mortgages or credit on such farms. Rural municipalities
like Middlesex Centre with 6 crude oil and product lines should take notice of the above
scenario from item 5 above. Many such municipalities from Sarnia to London and
towards Toronto, with some of the most productive Class I land in Canada, could have a
serious drop in assessment if one or two ruptures as in Michigan occurred along Line 9.
I hope that Municipal governments in Ontario would be very concerned about a possible
exemption for a thorough hearing of assessment for the safety of our environment as
well as our personal safety.
7. l have enclosed a photograph of a section of the exposed Line 9 on our property,
taken July, 2009. See Fig (a) on page 3. Yes, the pipe has the polyethylene tape
covering. You can see folds or wrinkles in the polyethylene wrapping. I could see a
clear liquid dripping from some of the folds. These wrinkles or folds are called “tenting”.
The NEB SCC report on page 24 states “Because of the high electrical insulating
properties of the polyethylene tape, and the long path under the tape, the catholic
current applied through the soil cannot reach the pipe surface to prevent corrosion,
consequently a potent environment may exist which will contribute to the formation of
near neutral pH SCC.” If we combine the sentence from above and look at the photo of
the pipeline on my farm, you can only conclude that under folds, conditions may be
potent for SCC. Note, sometimes 300 have caused pipe ruthres. I cannot imagine
this image is the only area of the pipe surface that has tented on our farm. Thus it is
quite possible that the pipeline is continuing to rust as we speak.

I have no idea how Enbridge can locate all the tenting all along the pipeline. I
hope they can. I understand they can locate some tenting if they locate rusting first (ie
pipe thinning). Sometime accidents happen, as near Binbrook Ontario, where a rupture,
on an Enbridge Line, occurred several years ago. In my opinion, I am sure it will be very
difﬁcult for Enbridge to keep Line 9 operating without an increased rate of incidents.

-3-
The problem with that plan of action is that Line 9 landowners relativity have the most to
lose. (Refer to Item #6). So may the environment.
If Enbridge has long term customers for Line 9, then they should remove the existing
Line 9 and build a modern pipeline which will withstand the most modern standards for
the products carried in the pipe. The two projects could be done almost at once with the
pipe removed only a few days ahead of the new line. This project should only proceed
in dry conditions!

8. Line 9 pipeline is 400 ft. from our recently drilled water well. Our well driller stated
before he started drilling that we would hit water at 200 it. We hit water at 202 ft. The
Aquifer is 20 ft. deep. Two well drillers told me that everyone in the area hits water at
the same level. A ruptured pipe in a crude oil pipeline or a slow leak could cause major
’damage. Our neighbour, who milks 750 cows daily has 3 wells drilled into the aquifer.
Once the damage is done, it is done.
To Board Members, I hope these comments will help to convince you, the Board to
endorse a full independent public inquiry, fully funded into the future use of Enbridge’s
Line 9 pipeline.

Re: Enbridge’s Line 9 Reversal Phase 1 Project
I am writing regarding Enbridge’s pmposed Line 9 Reversal project ﬁled with the National
Energy Board in August; ,
The Oneida Nation of the Thamee tElected Chicfand Council, do not believe that the request for 8
facilities exemption order is appropriate-for this project.
The Line 9 pipeline crosses the traditional territory of the Haudenosaunee as rééognized in the
1701 Nanfan Treaty. The infomlationjwe have received indicates that Line 9 is an older pipeline
that has the same construction as the one that ruptured 'in Michigan and spilled into the
Kalamazoo River in 2010 and that Enbridge may be planning to bring diluted bitumen through
Line 9, which is more abrasive and'corrosive, needing higher pressures and temperatures leading
to increased risk.
We are concerned about the project’s potential risks, implications and impacts on the lands,
waters, rights and interests of the Oneida Nation of the Thames. We request that the NEB not
allow Enbridge to apply for an exemption under ,section 58 of the National Energy Board Act
that would reduce its disclosure of information and conSultation.
Yours Sincerely,
Chief Joel Abram
Oneida Nation of the Thames

             Re:      Line 9 reversal – Phase 1 Project (A30643) Enbridge
             To:      National Energy Board
             On behalf of the Natural Resources Defense Council, we submit our formal objection to
             Enbridge’s application to the NEB for a Section 58 exemption. Enbridge’s application
             for a Section 58 exemption should be denied because it is part of a larger project that
             demands a more comprehensive evaluation of the broader “Trailbreaker” project
             announced in 2008. Narrowly scoping the project this way precludes an assessment of
             the wide range of issues that would be considered for the comprehensive project.
             Furthermore, rejecting this exemption would enable the NEB to more properly pursue its
             regulatory responsibility.
             In its application to the NEB and in seeking to be exempted from a more comprehensive
             assessment, Enbridge states “any potential adverse environmental or socio-economic
             effects are not likely significant.” There is growing evidence that tar sands pipelines have
             a higher incidence of corrosion leading to a greater incidence of spills. This is particularly
             important given the pipeline was built for certain temperatures and pressures. NRDC is
             particularly concerned about the fact this pipeline uses the same polyethylene coating that
             was used in the Enbridge pipeline that ruptured in Michigan in 2010 which has had a
             profound impact to the local community.
             The NEB must also consider the broader ramifications of how the broader Trailbreaker
             project would result in the transport of different crudes than previously transported in the
             pipeline system. NRDC recently published a study on the subject of tar sands, its
             corrosive nature, and how it affects pipeline safety. The report, Tar Sands Pipelines
             Safety Risks, reports that tar sands pipelines carrying diluted bitumen raise the risks of
             spills and damage to communities. A more comprehensive assessment of the Trailbreaker
             project should enable NEB to evaluate the additional risks that would occur with
             transporting DilBit at higher temperatures and pressures particularly given the age of the
             existing pipeline. We also recommend the NEB consider the additional precautions that
             will be needed for this pipeline for transporting DilBit and whether the existing pipeline

 can protect against corrosion of the pipeline. And finally, the NEB should evaluate
whether there is sufficient technology to detect leaks in the shortest possible team and
whether sufficient spill responses are in place. Any evaluation by the NEB should take
into account the knowledge that has been gained from the significant spill by Enbridge’s
Lakehead System Line 6B into the Kalamazoo River. According to the US EPA, the
clean up of tar sands from this spill is fundamentally different from a conventional oil
spill and more difficult.
Finally, in its application to the NEB, Enbridge stated that the effects of the project “will
not be a cause for public concern.” In fact, public concern about the increased risks of
transporting diluted bitumen has grown significantly in the past year in both Canada and
the U.S. As of the writing of these comments, there have already been dozens of
comments submitted to the NEB from concerned citizens. There can be no doubt that
this project will be a cause for public concern.
There are many other issues that concern NRDC about this proposal including the
implications of higher greenhouse gas emissions and the broader socio-economic impacts
that would occur with pursuing investments in heavy oil infrastructure and how it might
be counter to efforts to pursue clean energy in eastern Canada and the United States. We
look forward to the opportunity to raise these concerns in more detail with a more
detailed application from Enbridge for the entire project.

- Dear Ms. Erickson,

RE: Enbridge Pipelines Inc. (Enbridge) Line 9 Reversal Phase 1 Project Application made pursuant to
section 58 of the National Energy Board Act

As landowners, we have concerns regarding this application and the very seemingly rushed manner in
which this application appears to be proceeding. We would like to have commented also on the”
August 26th letter" signed by environmental groups, etc. but we have not been able to access it.

Our concerns include the quality of the steel in Line 9. The quaiity of steel at the time of construction is
obviously not of the superior quality available now. We understand Line 9 has polyethylene tape
coating which is more susceptible to disbonding and to stress corrosion cracking. Is oil sands oil more
abrasive than regular crude oil? And if so, would it not wear the inside of the pipe out prematurely?
And possibly a catastrophic failure of he pipeline? We, as iandowners , would Iike answers to these
questions before this project proceeds. We are also concerned with the operating pressure of Line 9.
Can it withstand the corrosive and/or abrasive nature of this oil sands oil?

With so many oil expiosions and accidents lately, we are naturally very concerned about the safety of
these pipelines that cross our land and which affect our family's livelihood and aiso the pleasu re of our
land and the surrounding environment . We respectfully ask for answers to our questions BEFORE this
project proceeds.
Sincerely, ‘

Marilyn Gilia rd Stephen Gilia rd

Subject: Line 9 Reversal – Phase 1 Project (A30643)
Dear National Energy Board,
I am writing regarding Enbridge's proposed Line 9 Reversal (A30643) filed with the National
Energy Board in August.
I do not believe that the request for a facilities exemption order is appropriate for this
project, and urge the NEB to instead require Enbridge to provide a more detailed application
and to hold public hearings on the proposal.
I am concerned that the project would increase the amount of tar sands oil in Ontario, which
creates more greenhouse gas emissions than conventional oil and is more corrosive and
dangerous to transport. It would also threaten Ontario's energy security by limiting our
sources of oil.
Please use your regulatory authority to ensure a transparent, comprehensive review of the
proposed pipeline reversal that considers the interests of First Nations, landowners and the
public.

  Dear Mr. George:
           Enbridge Pipelines Inc. (Enbridge) Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project (the Project)
 The National Energy Board (Board) is a federal regulator that regulates pipelines across Canada,
  specifically pipelines that cross provincial boundaries and the border into the United States. The
 Board is contacting you regarding an oil pipeline Project for which an application has been
 received and set down for an oral public hearing by the Board.
 Enbridge applied on 8 August 2011 to the Board under section 58 of the NEB Act for the
 additions and modifications required to allow the reversal of crude oil flow within the segment of
 the existing 762 mm (30-inch) outside diameter Line 9 between the Sarnia Terminal and the
 North Westover Station, in south-western Ontario (the Application). These additions and
 modifications are related to pumps, piping, valves, a pig trap, and densitometers at the Sarnia
 Terminal, the North Westover Station, the Westover Terminal and at a location 4.12 km west of
 the North Westover Station. A new electrical building would also be built at the Westover
 Station.
 The Board issued Hearing Order OH-005-201 1 on 5 December 2011, setting out the initial steps
 for the oral public hearing process. The Hearing Order, Application, and all other submissions
 are available for viewing electronically on the Board’s website at www.neb-onegc.ca under
 Major Applications and Projects: Enbridge Line 9 Reversal Phase I. The Hearing Order includes
 information on how you can access the Application in hard copy.
 The application includes information from Enbridge regarding the impacts the Project is
 expected to have on Aboriginal interests.
                                                                                                           .12

One way of assessing whether a project is in the public interest is by way of a public hearing.
The hearing process is designed to allow parties with an interest in the Project to fully participate
in the Board’s process and express their views about the Project. These views may include
information in favour of or against the Project and on the impacts the Project may have on
Aboriginal communities, the current use of lands and resources for traditional purposes, and any
potential or established Treaty or Aboriginal rights.
The Board will make a decision of whether to approve the Project by weighing both the positive
and negative impacts of the Project. Should the Board approve the Project, it may impose
conditions to ensure any negative impacts will be mitigated or minimized.
The Board has established a Participant Funding Program to facilitate participation in the
Board’s regulatory process for oral facility hearings. For your information, we have attached a
copy of the Participant Funding Program Notice. You can also find the Participant Funding
Program Guide on the Board’s website (www.neb-one-gc.ca), by selecting Land Matters and
going to Participant Funding Program.
If you have any questions about the process, the Participant Funding Program, or how to
participate in the hearing, staff at the Board would be pleased to provide such information over
the phone or at a meeting in your community. Sean Maher, a Board Aboriginal Engagement
Specialist, will contact you in the coming weeks to see if you are interested in such information.
Alternatively, you may contact Sean directly at 403-299-1996, through the Board’s toll free
number at 1-800-899-1265 or by e-mail at sean.maher@neb-one.gc.ca.

L. George

 Enbridge Pipelines Inc. (Enbridge) Line 9 Reversal Phase I
 Project Summary
 The proposed Project involves the additions and modifications required to allow the reversal of
 crude oil flow within the segment of the existing Line 9 between the Sarnia Terminal and the
 North Westover Station, in south-western Ontario (the Application). These additions and
 modifications are related to pumps, piping, valves, a pig trap, and densitometers at the Sarnia
 Terminal, the North Westover Station, the Westover Terminal and at a location 4.12 km west of
the North Westover Station. A new electrical building would also be built at the Westover
 Station.
Line 9 currently transports crude oil in a westward direction, with deliveries from the Montreal
Terminal flowing through the North Westover Station and onward to either the Sarnia Terminal
or the Westover Terminal. In the reversed direction (eastward), crude oil would be delivered to
the Westover Terminal from the Sarnia Terminal.
All proposed work would take place on existing Enbridge facilities and surface leases, with no
planned ground disturbance along the pipeline right-of-way.
If you would like to discuss details or require additional information about the Project, the Board
encourages you to contact the applicant, Enbridge, directly at:

Dear Anne-Marie Erickson
Re: Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line 9
Thank you for your letter notifying the Chippewas of the Thames First Nation (“COTTFN”) about your
proposed initiative. We refer to ourselves as Ojibwe and are a part of a larger group of Anishinaabe
(people) that come from the Algonkian language family. COTTFN is a sovereign and self-governing
nation residing on land that has never been ceded. Through a series of Treaties made with the Crown,
our people agreed to share our duties and responsibilities over our traditional territory to protect our
rights in these lands.
At the time of our Treaties with the Crown, our people moved freely throughout the Southern Great
Lakes Area utilizing the land, waterways and air for the abundant resources that sustained the people of
our Nation. Historically the Canadian and provincial governments have tried to undermine Anishinaabe
government based on a denial of our inherent jurisdiction; however in recent years, that has changed
with the recognition and entrenchment of our rights in the Constitution Act, 1982, and the Supreme
Court of Canada decisions that have clearly identified a duty to consult where our rights may potentially
impacted. This duty belongs to the Crown and the Crown alone is responsible for ensuring the duty has
been adequately discharged; however, as the proponent, we understand that some of the procedural
elements of that duty have been delegated to you.
Your proposed development lies within our traditional territory. As there may be potential impacts to
the exercise of our rights caused by your initiative, we appreciate the opportunity to discuss with you
what these potential impacts may be how they might be mitigated and/or acconrmodated. COTTFN
seeks to establish strong working relationships with any proponent who respects Anishinaabe values and
principles. We further appreciate that the cooperation and support of the COTTFN will help provide

Re: OH-005-2011 - Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project
Attn: Ms. Young and Ms. Losier,
I am writing to express my objection to the Enbridge Line 9 reversal project in Ontario. The project raises the threat of
a pipeline spill in Ontario because it would mean transporting the oil at an increased pressure, and would likely cause
a shift to more polluting and corrosive tar sands oil. This poses a risk to the ecosystems and health of Ontario
residents.
 I am also concerned that the project threatens Ontario’s energy security, cutting off imports from the East, and
increasing our dependence on oil from the tar sands.
I respectfully ask you to withhold approval of this project in order to preserve the safety and security of Ontario’s
environment and its residents.
Yours truly,

a pipeline spill in Ontario because it would mean transporting the oil at an increased pressure, and would likely cause
a shift to more polluting and corrosive tar sands oil. This poses a risk to the ecosystems and health of Ontario
residents. Because I live in Ontario and belong to several organizations striving to protect Great Lakes ecosystems,
this pipeline reversal is of great concern to me.
I am also concerned that the project threatens Ontario’s energy security, cutting off imports from the East, and
increasing our dependence on oil from the tar sands. From my perspective Canada has to start taking the need for
conservation practices and alternative energy seriously. We cannot continue with the current drive to exploit every
available source of oil and gas at the expense of environmental and human health at both global and local levels.
 I respectfully ask you to withhold approval of this project in order to preserve the safety and security of Ontario’s
environment and its residents. I believe withholding approval is one small way to start forcing decision makers to
work on new and better solutions to Canada’s energy needs.

Enbridge Pipelines Inc. - Application for Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project (OH-005-2011)
Attn: Ms. Sheri Young and Ms.Anne Losier,
My interest in this application comes from being a resident of Ontario and having children and grandchildren in this
province, some of whom will live in what is likely to be the path of the Enbridge-Line 9 pipeline. I cycle in the area
south of Lake Simcoe and am have a deep appreciation for the forests,natural areas and vibrant farms there.
I am writing to express my objection to the Enbridge Line 9 reversal project in Ontario. The project raises the threat of
 a pipeline spill in Ontario because it would mean transporting the oil at an increased pressure, and would likely cause
a shift to more polluting and corrosive tar sands oil. This poses a risk to the ecosystems and health of Ontario
residents. I don't want to rely upon energy that poisons my fellow Canadians living elsewhere, either.
I am also concerned that the project threatens Ontario’s energy security, cutting off imports from the East, and
increasing our dependence on oil from the tar sands, which is known to be causing environmental and medical
problems in western provinces, especially in native communities.
I respectfully ask you to withhold approval of this project in order to preserve the safety and security of Ontario’s
environment and its residents. Please put me, my children and grandchildren, our neighbours and fellow Ontarians
first, over the interests of big oil corporations. Help preserve our health and well-being for the next century.
Respectfully,
Melissa Gold

Re: OH-005-2011 - Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project
Attn: Ms. Young and Ms. Losier,
I am writing to express my objection to the Enbridge Line 9 reversal project in Ontario. The project raises the threat of
a pipeline spill in Ontario because it would mean transporting the oil at an increased pressure, and would likely cause
a shift to more polluting and corrosive tar sands oil. This poses a risk to the ecosystems and health of Ontario
residents.
 I am also concerned that the project threatens Ontario’s energy security, cutting off imports from the East, and
increasing our dependence on oil from the tar sands.
I respectfully ask you to withhold approval of this project in order to preserve the safety and security of Ontario’s
environment and its residents.
Furthermore, I resent the tactics used by the national energy board to attempt to disregard valid email based
complaints. I would assume an organization designed to address national energy would accept the form of
correspondence with the least impact on national energy.

        I oppose the Enbridge Line 9 reversal project in Ontario. The project could easily lead to
pipeline spills since the oil would be transported at a higher pressure. Spills have occurred with
other similar Enbridge pipelines, such as the one in Michigan. Pipeline spills would have severe,
negative consequences for the health of Ontario residents and the environment. I am in
opposition of this project and ask that you withhold approval of the project so that the health of
Ontarians and our environment will not be threatened.

     I am writing to express my objection to the Enbridge Line 9 reversal project in Ontario. The project raises the
     threat of a pipeline spill in Ontario because it would mean transporting the oil at an increased pressure, and
     would likely cause a shift to more polluting and corrosive tar sands oil. This poses a risk to the ecosystems and
     health of Ontario residents.
     I am also concerned that the project threatens Ontario’s energy security, cutting off imports from the East, and
     increasing our dependence on oil from the tar sands.
     I respectfully ask you to withhold approval of this project in order to preserve the safety and security of Ontario’s

Dear Ms Young:
I am seriously concerned about the plan to change the flow on the Enbridge Line 9
Reversal Phase 1 Project. I understand that when a similar change was introduced in
           -
Michigan, there was a spill that caused major environmental degradation.
I ask that the National Energy Board withhold approval of this plan and instead consider
the impact it would have on the environment.
Yours truly,

 Dear Ms Losier,
 I am writing about the OH-005-2011 Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project
                                        -
This project raises the potential of a pipeline spill in Ontario. Granted, it may never happen, but I don’t want
anyone to take the chance. Transporting the oil at an increased pressure would likely cause a shift to more
 polluting and corrosive tar sands oil. This poses a risk to the ecosystems and health of Ontario residents.
I am also concerned that the project threatens Ontario’s energy security, cutting off imports from the East,
and increasing our dependence on oil from the tar sands. Tar sands oil creates more global warming pollution
and chemicals that are harmful to humans than conventional oil and is more corrosive and dangerous to
transport through pipelines.
I am one of those who is looking long term, past the necessity of relying on oil for energy. I urge you to
support renewables and turn your back on sources that are polluting, dangerous and unhealthy.
I vociferously ask you to withhold approval of this project in order to preserve the safety and security of
Ontario’s environment and its residents.
Respectfully yours,

Subject: Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project
Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands into the United States. There is a
proposal by Enbridge Inc. to reverse a part of its Line 9 pipeline in
Ontario but there are several reasons to believe this is a first step
in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and
Vermont.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian oil
from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United
States. Tar sands results in more greenhouse gas pollution than
conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines
that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be
considered because this project will open the door to expanding the
project down the road.
Sincerely,
Ms. Robyn Carmichael

Subject: Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project
Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands into the United States. There is a
proposal by Enbridge Inc. to reverse a part of its Line 9 pipeline in
Ontario, but there are several reasons to believe this is a first step
in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and
Vermont.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian oil
from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United
States. Tar sands results in more greenhouse gas pollution than
conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines
that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be
considered because this project will open the door to expanding the
project down the road.
Sincerely,
Ian Evans

There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United

conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines

Subject: Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project
Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands into the United States. There is a
proposal by Enbridge Inc. to reverse a part of its Line 9 pipeline in
Ontario, but there are several reasons to believe this is a first step
in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and
Vermont.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian oil
from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.

I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,

from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United
States. Tar sands results in more greenhouse gas pollution than
conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines
that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be

project down the road.

I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands into the United States. There is a
proposal by Enbridge Inc. to reverse a part of its Line 9 pipeline in
Ontario, but there are several reasons to believe this is a first step
in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and
Vermont.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian oil
from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United
States. Tar sands results in more greenhouse gas pollution than
conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines
that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be
considered because this project will open the door to expanding the
project down the road.
Sincerely,
Nicholas Allgaier

already besieged wilderness areas by developers. We have already
suffered one major oil-spill very near my home. Plus, my concern for
wildlife populations, especially wolves, that will undoubtedly be
jeopardized by this project just turns my stomach.
I strongly urge you to consider whether this proposal is really an
independent project, or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to
take Canadian oil from western Canada to eastern Canada and from there

Subject: Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project
Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands into the United States. There is a
proposal by Enbridge Inc. to reverse a part of its Line 9 pipeline in
Ontario, but there are several reasons to believe this is a first step
in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and
Vermont.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian oil
from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United
States. Tar sands results in more greenhouse gas pollution than
conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines
that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be
considered because this project will open the door to expanding the
project down the road.
Sincerely,
Melanie Fengler

Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
I write as a scientist with great concerned about a proposal by
Enbridge that could eventually create a new pathway for tar sands into
the United States. There is a proposal by Enbridge Inc. to reverse a
part of its Line 9 pipeline in Ontario, but there are several reasons
to believe this is a first step in a larger project to bring Canadian
oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont.
As a life-long resident of New England, which has experienced acid rain
destruction of water resources, and elevated mercury in our waters, We
do NOT want this oil in our area.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,

or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian oil
from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
I am very opposed to bringing more tar sands into the United States.
Tar sands results in more greenhouse gas pollution than conventional
oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines that can lead
to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be considered
because this project will open the door to expanding the project down
the road.

Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands into the United States. There is a
proposal by Enbridge Inc. to reverse a part of its Line 9 pipeline in
Ontario, but there are several reasons to believe this is a first step
in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and
Vermont.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,

I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian oil
from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United
States. Tar sands results in more greenhouse gas pollution than
conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines
that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be
considered because this project will open the door to expanding the
project down the road.

Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands into the United States. There is a
proposal by Enbridge Inc. to reverse a part of its Line 9 pipeline in
Ontario, but there are several reasons to believe this is a first step
in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and
Vermont.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,

Subject: Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project
Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands into the United States. There is a
proposal by Enbridge Inc. to reverse a part of its Line 9 pipeline in
Ontario, but there are several reasons to believe this is a first step
in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and
Vermont.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian oil
from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United
States. Tar sands results in more greenhouse gas pollution than
conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines
that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be
considered because this project will open the door to expanding the
project down the road.
Sincerely,
Julli Morrison

Ontario, but there are several reasons to believe this is a first step

There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United

conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines

I strongly feel that we don't need more ways to bring in new sources of
petroleum, we need to focus our resources on using the supplies we
already have more efficiently and wisely, and finding alternatives. No
matter how we wring tar sands (and such borderline methods) dry, we
will run out of petroleum, and we need NOW to be finding alternative
energy sources, that will not run out (solar, wind, tidal, etc.)
Especially in the Northeast of the US and Canada, we have many
alternatives, including (if we want to import power from Canada) access
to the highest tides of the world from the Bay of Fundy.
I urge you to consider whether the Enbridge proposal is an independent
project, or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take

Subject: Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project
Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands into the United States. There is a
proposal by Enbridge Inc. to reverse a part of its Line 9 pipeline in
Ontario, but there are several reasons to believe this is a first step
in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and
Vermont.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian oil
from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United
States. Tar sands results in more greenhouse gas pollution than
conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines
that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be
considered because this project will open the door to expanding the
project down the road.
Sincerely,
Lauren Gramlich

Subject: Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project
Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands into the United States. There is a
proposal by Enbridge Inc. to reverse a part of its Line 9 pipeline in
Ontario, but there are several reasons to believe this is a first step
in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and
Vermont.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian oil
from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United
States. Tar sands results in more greenhouse gas pollution than
conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines
that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be
considered because this project will open the door to expanding the
project down the road.
Sincerely,
Cynthia Harris

Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
As a supporter of the National Wildlife Federation I am beyond concern
as to the aspect of the welfare for the wolves that live in the
Northeast and their habitats that are in dire danger. There need to be
solid well thought out plans for bringing Canadian oil thru/into the
United States. The plans that have been laid out for this expansion
does not seem to take into consideration the wildlife and the areas
that they are living in which will be inhumanely destroyed by man
without even thinking twice. Why does our wildlife and the land that
they live on have to be sacrificed. I am sure there are other ways
that have not been ascribed to because of the lack of intelligence,
motivation and just not "caring". When these animals and
their homes are gone we will never see them again as a vital part of
our lives and heritage. Shame on you!

is a very real danger for damage to the environment from pollution and

Subject: Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project
Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands into the United States. There is a
proposal by Enbridge Inc. to reverse a part of its Line 9 pipeline in
Ontario, but there are several reasons to believe this is a first step
in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and
Vermont.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian oil
from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United
States. Tar sands results in more greenhouse gas pollution than
conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines
that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be
considered because this project will open the door to expanding the
project down the road.
Sincerely,
Daniel Meyer

Subject: Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project
Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands into the United States. There is a
proposal by Enbridge Inc. to reverse a part of its Line 9 pipeline in
Ontario, but there are several reasons to believe this is a first step
in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and
Vermont.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian oil
from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United
States. Tar sands results in more greenhouse gas pollution than
conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines
that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be
considered because this project will open the door to expanding the
project down the road.
Sincerely,
Alex Brown

Subject: Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project
Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
It is of extreme concern to me that Enbridge wants to impose their
Trailbreaker tar sands pipeline on the northeast states. There is a
proposal by Enbridge Inc. to reverse a part of its Line 9 pipeline in
Ontario; however, there are several reasons to believe this is a first
STEP in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine,
and Vermont.
It is imperative that you consider whether this proposal is an
independent project, OR if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to
take Canadian oil from western Canada to eastern Canada and THEN to the
United States. This longer-term plan would have SIGNIFICANT impacts on
the environment; on waterways; and on the climate---ALL critical
factors that MUST be properly assessed BEFORE making a decision.
There is GROWING OPPOSITION to bringing more tar sands into the United
States. Tar sands results in MORE greenhouse gas pollution than
conventional oil, and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines
that can lead to MORE frequent spills. These and other issues MUST be
considered because this project will open the door to expanding the
project down the road.
Sincerely,
Jayne Chase

There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United
States. Tar sands results in more greenhouse gas pollution than
conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines
that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be
considered because this project will open the door to expanding the

Subject: Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project
Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands into the United States. There is a
proposal by Enbridge Inc. to reverse a part of its Line 9 pipeline in
Ontario, but there are several reasons to believe this is a first step
in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and
Vermont.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian oil
from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before

There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United

conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines

Subject: Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project
Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands into the United States. There is a
proposal by Enbridge Inc. to reverse a part of its Line 9 pipeline in
Ontario, but there are several reasons to believe this is a first step
in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and
Vermont.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian oil
from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before

Subject: Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project
Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands into the United States. There is a
proposal by Enbridge Inc. to reverse a part of its Line 9 pipeline in
Ontario, but there are several reasons to believe this is a first step
in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and
Vermont.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian oil
from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United
States. Tar sands results in more greenhouse gas pollution than
conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines
that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be
considered because this project will open the door to expanding the
project down the road.
Sincerely,
Judy Gerowe

Subject: Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project
Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands into the United States. There is a
proposal by Enbridge Inc. to reverse a part of its Line 9 pipeline in
Ontario, but there are several reasons to believe this is a first step
in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and
Vermont.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian oil
from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United
States. Tar sands results in more greenhouse gas pollution than
conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines
that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be
considered because this project will open the door to expanding the
project down the road.
Sincerely,
Danica B

Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands into the United States. There is a
proposal by Enbridge Inc. to reverse a part of its Line 9 pipeline in
Ontario, but there are several reasons to believe this is a first step
in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and
Vermont.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian oil
from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.

I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,

from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United
States. Tar sands results in more greenhouse gas pollution than
conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines
that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be
considered because this project will open the door to expanding the
project down the road.

I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually

Ontario, but there are several reasons to believe this is a first step
in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and

You are being insidious, quite obviously -- furthermore, your plan to
extirpate wild wolves is pathological. I really truly expected more
from you, Canada; thought Canadians had more sense and balance than we
down here have, where most of our public officials are manifestly
bonkers.
Didn't you know that wolves cull the caribou herds, and actually
improve the overall health of the species? Did you really not know
this? If I know it -- why do you remain in ignorance? Learn your
wildlife biology factoids before you blast the bejasus out of a
beneficial animal population -- to wit: GREY WOLVES. They are not
only benificial; they are keenly intelligent, beautiful, fascinating,
and their presence is an inherent and key part of maintaining the
natural equation among creatures.
And by the bye -- tar sands are thoroughly awful in all qualitative and
quantitative ways. As I asked above: did you really not know this?
Stop listening to myopic, self-serving, industrialists and their
lobbyists, and listen to serious scientists before you drill the
bejasus out of a beautiful, crucial, environment. That
now-still-pristine landscape will never return once the oil moguls
destroy it. No matter what unctuous (pun intended)
"assurances" they pour into your ears.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,

Subject: Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project
Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands into the United States. There is a
proposal by Enbridge Inc. to reverse a part of its Line 9 pipeline in
Ontario, but there are several reasons to believe this is a first step
in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and
Vermont.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian oil
from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United
States. Tar sands results in more greenhouse gas pollution than
conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines
that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be
considered because this project will open the door to expanding the
project down the road.
Sincerely,
Leonidas Taylor

Subject: Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project
Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands into the United States. There is a
proposal by Enbridge Inc. to reverse a part of its Line 9 pipeline in
Ontario, but there are several reasons to believe this is a first step
in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and
Vermont.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian oil
from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United
States. Tar sands results in more greenhouse gas pollution than
conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines
that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be
considered because this project will open the door to expanding the
project down the road.
Sincerely,
Rachel Bishop

There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United
States. Tar sands results in more greenhouse gas pollution than
conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines
that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be

Subject: Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project
Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands into the United States. There is a
proposal by Enbridge Inc. to reverse a part of its Line 9 pipeline in
Ontario, but there are several reasons to believe this is a first step
in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and
Vermont.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian oil
from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.

environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United
States. Tar sands results in more greenhouse gas pollution than
conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines
that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be
considered because this project will open the door to expanding the
project down the road.

Subject: Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project
Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands into the United States. There is a
proposal by Enbridge Inc. to reverse a part of its Line 9 pipeline in
Ontario, but there are several reasons to believe this is a first step
in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and
Vermont.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian oil
from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before

I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands into the United States. There is a
proposal by Enbridge Inc. to reverse a part of its Line 9 pipeline in
Ontario, but there are several reasons to believe this is a first step
in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and
Vermont.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian oil
from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United
States. Tar sands results in more greenhouse gas pollution than
conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines
that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be
considered because this project will open the door to expanding the
project down the road.
Sincerely,
Evan Fulmer

Subject: Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project
Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands into the United States. There is a
proposal by Enbridge Inc. to reverse a part of its Line 9 pipeline in
Ontario, but there are several reasons to believe this is a first step
in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and
Vermont.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian oil
from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United
States. Tar sands results in more greenhouse gas pollution than
conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines
that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be
considered because this project will open the door to expanding the
project down the road.
Sincerely,
Meryl Pinque

Subject: Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project
Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands into the United States. There is a
proposal by Enbridge Inc. to reverse a part of its Line 9 pipeline in
Ontario, but there are several reasons to believe this is a first step
in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and
Vermont.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian oil
from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United
States. Tar sands results in more greenhouse gas pollution than
conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines
that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be
considered because this project will open the door to expanding the
project down the road.
Sincerely,
Barbara Fudala

from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United
States. Tar sands results in more greenhouse gas pollution than
conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines
that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be
considered because this project will open the door to expanding the
project down the road.

Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands into the United States. There is a
proposal by Enbridge Inc. to reverse a part of its Line 9 pipeline in
Ontario, but there are several reasons to believe this is a first step
in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and
Vermont.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,

or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian oil
from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United
States. Tar sands results in more greenhouse gas pollution than
conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines
that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be
considered because this project will open the door to expanding the
project down the road.

Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands into the United States. There is a
proposal by Enbridge Inc. to reverse a part of its Line 9 pipeline in
Ontario, but there are several reasons to believe this is a first step
in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and
Vermont.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,

Vermont.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian oil
from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United
States. Tar sands results in more greenhouse gas pollution than
conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines
that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be
considered because this project will open the door to expanding the
project down the road.

Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands into the United States. There is a

Subject: Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project
Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands, which are destroying Canada's
lands, water, and wildlife for private short-term profits, into the
United States. There is a proposal by Enbridge Inc. to reverse a part
of its Line 9 pipeline in Ontario, but there are several reasons to
believe this is a first step in a larger project to bring Canadian oil
to New Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian oil
from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United
States. Tar sands results in more greenhouse gas pollution than
conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines
that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be
considered because this project will open the door to expanding the
project down the road.
Sincerely,
Cynthia Simon

from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United
States. Tar sands results in more greenhouse gas pollution than
conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines
that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be
considered because this project will open the door to expanding the
project down the road.

Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands into the United States. There is a
proposal by Enbridge Inc. to reverse a part of its Line 9 pipeline in
Ontario, but there are several reasons to believe this is a first step
in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and
Vermont.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian oil

Ontario, but there are several reasons to believe this is a first step
in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and
Vermont.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian oil
from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United
States. Tar sands results in more greenhouse gas pollution than
conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines
that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be
considered because this project will open the door to expanding the
project down the road.

Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
I am appalled by the proposal by Enbridge to reverse a part of its Line
9 pipeline in Ontario, and I am quite sure this is a first step in a
larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and
Vermont.
I've no doubt that this is part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian
oil from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United
States.
Canada is already pillaging its lands, with tar sands oil and fracking
for gas, resulting in more greenhouse gas pollution, not to mention the
destruction of pristine habitats, spills, explosions, and the resulting
illnesses and deaths of wildlife, domestic and farm animals, and
humans.
It would be insane to allow this latest pipeline project. Say no.

Subject: Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project
Dear Canada's National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands into the United States. There is a
proposal by Enbridge Inc. to reverse a part of its Line 9 pipeline in
Ontario, but there are several reasons to believe this is a first step
in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to New Hampshire, Maine, and
Vermont.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian oil
from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States.
This longer-term plan would have significant impacts to the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands into the United
States. Tar sands results in more greenhouse gas pollution than
conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines
that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be
considered because this project will open the door to expanding the
project down the road.
Sincerely,
Barbara Walling

Let me begin by saying that the tar sands oil is one of the worst
environmental disasters to be sanctioned by the oil industry, not only
because of the enormous amount of energy and water required to extract
the oil, but also the devastating effects on migrating birds and the
release of untold amounts of carbon into our atmosphere.

examine the Enbridge proposal to assess Whether it might eventually be
used to put in place a new pathway for tar sands bitumin or oil.

Dear National Energy Board,

We just had the warmest winter on record here in Maine, and spring has

tumed to summer 6 weeks earlier than normal. the effects of climate

change are happening now and it is time to take signiﬁcant action to

decrease the use of fossil ﬁlels.

Enbridge's proposal to reverse part of the Line 9 pipeline is really

part of a bigger plan to bn’ng Canadian oil to Maine. This is simply

another strategy for bringing tar sands oil into the US. The companies

have openly admitted that their next step will be to bring the oil to

Montréal and then Portland, Maine.

This is clearly not an proposal is an independent project, but rather

of a longer-term plan to take Canadian tar sands oil from western

Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United States. The whole

pipeline project would have terrible impacts on climate change, Before ‘

making a decision, I urge you to consider the climate impacts.

Many people in the US oppose bringing in tar sands oil. Tar sands oil

results in more greenhouse gas pollution than conventional oil and has

acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines that can lead to more

frequent spills. These and other issues must be considered new because

this project will open the door to expanding the project down the road.

across my state—-passing through my town and putting the Portland Water
District at risk as well as my property on the Crooked River in
Harrison. There are several reasons to believe this current application
to reverse part of Line 9 pipeline in Ontario is merely a ﬁrst step in

This 50 year old pipeline crosses through my town and I am concerned
about an oil spill in my back yard and my watershed. We all depend on
the watershed not only for our personal water needs but as a draw for
tourists who want to experience the clear air, land and water that
Maine has to offer. Any spill no matter how contained will effect our
way of life in many ways.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,

Dear National Energy Board,
It is with great concern that I learned of the proposal by Enbridge to
create a tar sands crude oil transportation corridor across sections of
the United States an my home state of Maine.
I have witnessed the subtle, devious, and greed-driven behavior of many
large multinationals, and the current application and its attendant
process has all the hallmarks of this type of strategy.
It has been suggested that reversing the Line 9 pipeline in Ontan'o is
merely a ﬁrst step in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to
Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, including the fact that the
companies have spoken openly about the possible next phase to transport
to Montreal and Portland, Maine.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian tar
sands oil from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United
States. The full plan would have signiﬁcant impacts on the
enviromnent, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision. The extraction and transport create numerous
threats that could have devastating economic and environmental impacts,
that leave the "little guy" holding the bag, while the
multinational skates away unharmed.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands oil into the

Re: Line 9 Reversal Phase 1
You originally suggested that the Hearings would be in the fall of 2012 to avoid disrupting necessary agricultural work
in the spring and summer, and to accommodate the required steps for participants
Now you announced that the hearings were now to take place from May 23-25. Why the rush?
You have not provided citizens any information and seem to be trying to conduct these hearings on the sly. Why the
secret?
 Two days is not long enough for citizens to voice their concerns. Why the hurry?
There are legitimate concerns about the safety of a pipeline, some sections are thinner-walled than others, and
“abandonment in place” is not a reasonable option. Enbridge put the pipeline there and made billions from it, it is their
responsibility to remove the pipeline when they are through milking it dry.
It looks like you are trying to shove this down our throats.
It looks like you are corrupt.
It looks like you are in the pocket of Enbridge.
Few Canadians have any respect for the NEB and its deliberations. Here is your chance to earn some respect by
rejecting Line 9 Reversal Phase 1.

Dear National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands oil into the United States and
across my state. There are several reasons to believe this current
application to reverse part of Line 9 pipeline in Ontario is merely a
ﬁrst step in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to Vermont, New
Hampshire, and Maine, including the fact that the conipanies have spoken
openly about the possible next phase to transport to Montreal and
Portland, Maine.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian tar
sands oil from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United
States. The full plan would have signiﬁcant impacts on the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision. '
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands oil into the
United States. Tar sands oil results in more greenhouse gas pollution
than conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive prOperties in
pipelines that can lead to more ﬁ'equent spills. These and other issues
must be considered now because this project will open the door to
expanding the project down the road. Don’t let our enviromnent be

that preperty line. The location of our well puts us at great risk of
contamination. l
The pipeline also crosses under a stream that abuts our property and
ﬂows into Panther Pond, that feeds Sebago Lake. Sebago Lake is the
water supply for the city of Portland and several neighboring towns.
Water quality is of utmost concern for us and we hope for you also . .
So we ask that you keep this in mind during your deliberations.

Hearing Order OH-005-201 1

Dear National Energy Board,

I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually

create a new pathway for tar sands oil into the United States and '

across my state. There are several reasons to believe this current

application to reverse part of Line 9 pipeline in Ontario is merely a

ﬁrst step in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to Vermont, New

Hampshire, and Maine, including the fact that the companies have spoken

openly about the possible next phase to transport to Montreal and

Portland, Maine.

I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,

or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian tar

sands oil ﬁ'om western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United

States. The ﬁll] plan would have signiﬁcant impacts on the

environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before

making a decision. '

There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands oil into the

United States. Tar sands oil results in more greenhouse gas pollution

than conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in

pipelines that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues

must be considered now because this proj ect will open the door to

expanding the project down the road. Don’t let our environment be

threatened by a piecemeal process.

There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands oil into the
United States. Tar sands oil replaces efforts to move to conservation
‘ and a combination of clean, renewable energy initiatives, results in
more greenhouse gas pollution than conventional oil, and has acidic and
corrosive properties in pipelines that can lead to more frequent
spills. Our current pipeline is very aged. These and other issues must
be considered now because this proj ect will open the door to expanding
the proj ect down the road. Don't let our environment be threatened by a

Maine is a relatively clean state and is progressive in energy
initiatives. We intend to maintain this stance. We have clean land and
water because we work hard to oppose polluting industries, and because
our livlihoods are linked to tourism and recreation. Our drinking water
is pristine and this plan will bring tar sand, which completely
devastate lands, water and wildlife to retrieve, to an aged pipeline
that runs along Maine's second largest lake, Sebago Lake, which is our
drinking eater supply. Further, it is a recreational hub.
We have no need or want of Canadian tar sands here.

reverse part of Line 9 pipeline in Ontario is merely a ﬁrst step in a
larger proj ect to bring Canadian oil to Vermont, New Hampshire, and
Maine, including the fact that the companies have Spoken openly about
the possible next phase to tranSport to Montreal and Portland, Maine.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-tenn plan to take Canadian tar
sands oil ﬁ-om western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United
States. The full plan would have signiﬁcant impacts on the

Dear National Energy Board,
Please do not allow Enbridge to send tar sands oil in the direction of
i Maine, even if the company attempts to do it piecemeal. There are
several reasons to believe the current application to reverse part of
Line 9 pipeline in Ontario is merely a ﬁrst step in a larger project
i to bring Canadian oil to Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine
: I am against getting tax sands oil to market anywhere because of the
. disastrous environmental consequences related to climate change,
‘ wildlife mortality, air and water pollution, and the very real threat
- of a potential spill along any route, but particularly Trailbreaker,
which passes close to Lake Sebago, the source of our drinking water
' here in Portland.
As a resident of a Casco Bay island, I also believe there will also be
serioﬁs risks to our local ﬁsheries should a Spill ever occur. I have
read about the disastrous Spill in Kalamazoo, MI and want nothing of
the kind here.
As you know, tar sands oil results in more greenhouse gas pollution
than conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in
pipelines that can lead to more frequent spills.
Please consider the larger environmental issues now, because this

into the United States, crossing Maine and my town. There are several reasons to believe this current
application to reverse part of Line 9 pipeline in Ontario is merely a ﬁrst step in a larger project to bring
Canadian oil to Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, including the fact that the companies have
spoken openly about the possible next phase to transport to Montreal and Portland, Maine.
This 50-year old pipeline crosses through my town. I am concerned about an oil spill in my back yard
and my watershed. Maine is a very wet place, with many lakes, streams, and wetlands. Spills would be
disastrous for our environment and wildlife. This pipeline is near the Crooked River, which serves as the
primary drinking water source for hundreds of thousands of people in the Portland area and is a I
valuable landlocked salmon fishery.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project, or if it is actually part of a
longer-term plan to take Canadian tar sands oil from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the
United States. The full plan would have signiﬁcant impacts on the environment, waterways, and the
climate that should be assessed before making a decision.
Tar sands oil produces more greenhouse gas pollution than conventional oil and has acidic and
corrosive properties in pipelines that can lead to more frequent spills. Furthermore, tar sands extraction
‘ has a devastating effect on the Canadian boreal forest. These and other issues must be considered now
because this project will open the door to expansion down the road. Don't let our environment be
threatened by a piecemeal process.

Thank you for considering these issues and for NOT allowing Such a
dangerous proj act to move forward. Our house in Newry, Maine is an old

passes close by would threaten not only the wildlife and pristine

Dear National Energy Board,

As a Maine grandmother of six young children and a life-long

outdoors-woman, I am writing to express my outrage at the proposed pipe

line through Maine. Ironically, I am currently in Colorado eating for

an elderly relati ve and every single day the newspapers in the Denver

area contain alarming updates on the contamination of wells, water

sources and land as energy exploration and tranSport continues

unchecked!

When will enough be enough for you folks? Does it take the elimination

of all clean air, water and land that can still be used to produce food

before you stop? Obviously, the serious illness and death of citizens

means nothing to your company, so one can only conclude that you will

continue until there is nothing left to save! That is how it feels to

those of us who are ﬁghting this ﬁght!

Speciﬁcally, I am writing about a pr0posal by Bnbridge that could

eventually create a new pathway for tar sands oil into the United

States and across my state. There are several reasons to believe this

current application to reverse part of Line 9 pipeline in Ontario is

merely a ﬁrst step in a larger proj ect to bring Canadian oil to

Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, including the fact that the

companies have spoken openly about the possible next phase to transport

to Montreal and Portland, Maine.

I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,

or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian tar

sands oil from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United

States. The full plan would have signiﬁcant impacts on the

environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before

making a decision.

There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands oil into the

United States. Tar sands oil results in more greenhouse gas pollution

than conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive prOperties in

must be considered now because this project will open the door to

Dear National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands oil into the United States and
across my state. There are several reasons to believe this current
application to reverse part of Line 9 pipeline in Ontario is merely a
. ﬁrst step in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to Vermont, New
Hampshire, and Maine, including the fact that the companies have spoken
Openly about the possible next phase to transport to Montreal and
. Portland, Maine.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian tar
sands oil from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United
States. The full plan would have signiﬁcant impacts on the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands oil into the
United States. Tar sands oil results in more greenhouse gas pollution '
than conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in
pipelines that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues
must be considered now because this proj ect will open the door to

Dear National Energy Board,
My name is J ames B. Owen and I live in Stoneham, ME. I spent most of my
working life as a teacher in Bethel, Me. My family was one of the
original settlers in his area, about 5 generations ago. Some of them
moved northwest along the Androscoggin River and settled in Coos County
NH. I returned here after stints in the army and graduate school
because I discovered by being away how deep my roots here are.
The Portland- Montreal pipeline had just been built When I renuned
permanently. It hadn't made much of a stir. Good jobs had been
available, and having the pipeline was just part of the cost of doing
business. Now I think things are much much different. At the age of z
81, I am convinced that we are seriously responsible for the ?
stewardship of the part of the world we live in.
In the best interest of my own home ground and in the best interest of
the State of Maine and whatever else you see when you look past the
- horizon, I urge you not to send tar sands through this pipeline. In
fact, I urge you to reconsider your stand on mining and then extracting
oil from the tar sands in the ﬁst place.
The environmental impact so far outweighs the actual oil that will be
produced that the whole project feels like folly. At some point proﬁt _
has to give way to responsible stewardship.
I am an experienced builder, and from that point of view putting
something as abrasive as tar sands through that very old pipeline give
me the willies. The risk of some kind of leakage - and any leak is a
disaster - seems to me so overwhelming that I wonder how the idea ever
got off the ground. I'd like to see 'proﬁt' become a bad word in this
instance.
Thanks you for taking the time to read this, and thank you in advance
for your wisdom and responsibility.

Given the age of the pipeline and a history of ruptures to similar

Since the pipeline passes next to Sebago Lake, the drinking water

supply for more than 15% of Maine people would be endangered and could

endanger Casco Bay and our ﬁshing and lobster industries. Where would

we be if something happened? Waiting for Enbridge to "ﬁx"

things after one of the dirtiest fossil fuels on the planet has

Subj ect: Enbridge Line 9 Reversal Phase I Proj ect Application under section 58 of the NEB Act
Hearing Order OH-005-2011
Dear National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathWay for tar sands oil into the United States and
across my state. There are several reasons to believe this current
application to reverse part of Line 9 pipeline in Ontario is merely a
ﬁrst step in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to Vermont, New
Hampshire, and Maine, including the fact that the companies have Spoken
openly about the possible next phase to transport to Montreal and
Portland, Maine.
. I urge you to consider Whether this proposal is an independent project,
| or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian tar
sands oil from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United
\ States. The full plan would have signiﬁcant impacts on the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
' ' making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands oil into the
United States. Tar sands oil results in more greenhouse gas pollution
than conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in
pipelines that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues .
must be considered new because this project will open the door to
expanding the project down the road. Don't let our environment be
threatened by a piecemeal process.

Maine, including the fact that the companies have spoken openly about
the possible next phase to transport to Montreal and Portland, Maine.
This 50 year old pipeline crosses through my town and I am concerned
about an oil spill in my back yard and my watershed.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,

sands oil from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United
States. The full plan would have signiﬁcant impacts on the ‘
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
There is growing Opposition to bringing more tar sands oil into the |
United States. Tar sands oil results in more greenhouse gas pollution
than conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in
pipelines that can lead to more frequent spills.
Furthermore, tar sands extraction has a devastating effect on the
Canadian boreal forest. These and other issues must be considered-now
because this proj ect will open the door to expanding the project down
the road. Don‘t let our environment be threatened by a piecemeal

‘ process.

Allowing tar sands pipelines would not bode well for the country or for
our section of Maine. They have a history of hundreds of ruptures over
the past decade which have polluted rivers and wetlands. The pipeline
in Maine passes close to Sebago Lake, the drinking water supply for
more than 15% Of Maine people. In addition for the potential for a
rupture polluting one of Maine's largest and most scenic lakes, damage
to the pipeline could also endanger Casco Bay and our ﬁshing and
lobster industries. _

those of us living near a
tar sands pipeline would be devastating. Water quality, ﬁsh and wildlife, hmnan health and economics
would all be severely impacted. Local people, far removed from the proﬁts of tar sands oil production, will i
be stuck beating the big brunt of the burden.
Oil may be what we think we need today, but in 50 years, our descendants will curse us for the problems we

Act Hearing Order 0H-005-2011

Dear National Energy Board:

As a Canadian citizen, I wish to express my profound disapproval of piping the Canadian Tar

Sands crude oil through the State of Maine, USA . While living in Nova Scotia, in the latter part

of the 20th Century, I well remember discussions on the media concerning the poor quality of

the product, the environmental damage it would create during extraction and the decision to

leave the proj ect alone until such time supply and demand made it necessary for

reconsideration. _
I now live in Otisﬁeld, Maine. This is a small rural community in the Lakes Region, mostly

wooded and relatively pristine. The existing pipeline runs through the western wooded section

of the town. Population of the town is only about 1880. '
There is a section of these woods called J ugtown Plains which contains the most northerly

Pitch Pine Bmen in northeastern USA. This section was put under conservation , ﬁrst by the

Maine Nature Conservancy, now it is in the hands of the Maine Department of Conservation. It

consists of 1200 acres and is owned by Hancock Land Co. Within the past year, through the

efforts of the local Conservation Committees/Commissions, the Nature Conservancy, the Maine

Department of Conservation, Oxford County Soil and Water District, Oxford County Forest

Services , the Hancock Land Company was persuaded to upgrade its efforts to maintain the

quality of this site . Hancock responded magniﬁcently and added other contingent properties

they owned, for an extensive hiking / nature and recreational trail system. The trail system now

wanders through 5000 acres of green space.

The oil pipeline follows the Easter Boundary of J ugtown Plantation and in the southernmost

sensitive area cuts through the conserved land. The pipeline is getting old and will be prone to

leaks in a highly ﬂammable forest type under conservation. Thank you for your consideration.

| Sincerely yours,

Mary Williams

Loon Echo Land Trust (LELT) is a 50103 non-proﬁt conservation organization that conserves 4,000 acres
of land in seven towns north of Sebago Lake, Maine. Several of the towns, including Harrison, Casco and
Raymond, have the 50 year old pipeline running through it.
This pipeline in Maine passes next to Sebago Lake, the drinking water supply for more than 15% of
Maine people. and could endanger the C rooked River, Casco Bay and our ﬁshing and lobster industries.
LELT, along with its partners, is focused on conserving lands along the Crooked River. This very river
provides 40% of the annual ﬂow into Sebago Lake, the public drinking water source for the greater
Portland. an area that is now threatened by the proposal by Enbridge that could allow tar sands oil ﬂow
into the part of the line that passed through Maine.
Our regional community does not want to risk having this pipeline rupture, as hundreds have over the past
decade, spilling more than one million gallons of oil that has polluted rivers, wetlands, and threatened
wildlife. The Crooked River is a designated C lass AA river by the State of Maine and is the primary
spawning and nursery area for landlocked Atlantic salmon, and if negatively impacted by a tar sands
pipeline. it would have a devastating effect, just like it has on the C anadian boreal forest.
I have heard from many residents in our region and they are gravely concerned about the proposal by
l Enbridge that could eventually create a new pathway for tar sands oil into the United States and across our
state—passing through their home towns. I believe this current application to reverse part of Line 9
pipeline in Ontario is merely a ﬁrst step in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to Vermont, New
Hampshire. and Maine. This 50 year old pipeline crosses through the towns that we serve and our
regional residents are concerned about an oil spill in watershed and their backyards.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project, or if it is actually part of a longer-
term plan to take Canadian tar sands oil from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United
States. The full plan would have significant impacts on the environment, waterways, and the climate that
should be assessed before making a decision.
These and other issues must be considered now because this project will open the door to expanding the

                   Body Re: OH-005-2011 Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project
                                            -
   Attn: Ms. Young and Ms. Losier,
   I am writing to express my objection to the Enbridge Line 9 reversal project in
   Ontario. The project raises the threat of a pipeline spill in Ontario because it
   would mean transporting the oil at an increased pressure, and would likely cause
   a shift to more polluting and corrosive tar sands oil. This poses a risk to the
   ecosystems and health of Ontario residents.
   I am also concerned that the project threatens Ontario’s energy security, cutting
   off imports from the East, and increasing our dependence on oil from the tar
   sands.
   Just two years ago, a similar Enbridge pipeline in Michigan spilled three million
   litres of tar sands oil into the Kalamazoo River, causing major contamination
   downstream.
   Enbridge’s proposal will likely increase the amount of tar sands oil in Ontario. Tar
   sands oil creates more global warming pollution and chemicals that are harmful
   to humans than conventional oil and is more corrosive and dangerous to
   transport through pipelines.
   Pipelines are inherently dangerous because they all leak.
   I respectfully ask you to withhold approval of this project in order to preserve the
   safety and security of Ontario’s environment and its residents.
   Sincerely,
(-

Dear National Energy Boaxd, |
i
I am extremely concerned by what I've heard and read about the !
possibility of bringing tar sands oil from Ontario to Portland, Maine
via what is known locally as Portland Pipeine.
I would imagine reversing the ﬂow of Portland Pipeline and employing
the line to bring tar sands oil would be extremely risky, given the age
of the line (50+ years) and that it would be being used for an
unintended purpose (tar sands) that could likely damage the aging
pipeline because of the corrosive/acidic nature of tar sands.
As a resident of Raymond, Maine and a property owner on Sebago Lake,
this idea terriﬁes me. Portland Pipeline is literally in view of this
lake. To even consider this project seems insane to me. Not only
could it have signiﬁcant environmental impact on the surrounding
watershed, I believe it puts at risk the drinking water supply for '
hundreds of thousands of people in Greater Portland. With that much
risk, why is this even being discussed? It is madness.
Maine's environment and unique places like Sebago Lake are what make
Maine special. Once it's destroyed or compromised, we can never get it
back. Never.
Sincerely,
Mr. Kevin Fay

Dear National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands oil into the United States and
across my state. There are several reasons to believe this current
application to reverse part of Line 9 pipeline in Ontario is merely a
ﬁrst step in a larger proj ect to bring Canadian oil to Vermont, New
Hampshire, and Maine, including the fact that the companies have Spoken
openly about the possible next phase to tranSport to Montreal and
Portland, Maine.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian tar
sands oil from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United
States. The full plan would have signiﬁcant impacts on the

making a decision. ‘
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands oil into the

Hearing Order OH-005-2011
. Dear National Energy Board,
I was shocked to learn of a proposal by the Enbridge company that could
send tar sands oil into the United States across my state, even through
my town! I write to urge you to consider the environmental and human
impact of the production and transmission of tar sands "oil"
very carefully and to do all you can to oppose the transmission of this
material into or through the United States.
From what I have heard, extraction of petroleum ﬁ'om tar sands is
itself a risky and energy-intensive process, and the thick product has
to be diluted to even make it ﬂow through pipes. There the corrosive
nature of the mixture causes deterioration of the pipes leading to a
much higher frequency of damage and leaks than with other forms of
petroleum. As you know, such deterioration and leakage in Michigan
spilled oil-sands petroleum into the Kalamazoo River, so it is
particularly disturbing to hear that the producers and transporters I
want to send this stuff through the 50-year-old pipeline that crosses
the town where I 1ive--next to the Androscoggin River! (Because they -
lie in Canada, I haven't even mentioned the destruction of forests in
the area where the tar—sands lie, forests that contribute to the
planet’s ability to deal with the dangerous level of carbon dioxide we
humans have spewed into the atmosphere. But that is surely another
factor contributing to the folly of using this ﬁlel.)
My main point is that the beneﬁt to be derived ﬁ'om extracting, '
transporting and eventually burning oil-sands petroleum is very low
compared to the destructive impact of its tranSportation and the
emissions ﬁ'om this "oil" and the other fossil fuels used in
its production. Even the few jobs that may be created in transporting
this fuel are not worth comparing to the beneﬁt to be derived ﬁ'om
conserving the various forms of energy we already have and working to
produce renewable and "cleaner" forms.
Thank you for considering my concerns.
Sincerely,

‘ Dear National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands oil into the United States and
across my state. There are several reasons to believe this current
application to reverse part of Line 9 pipeline in Ontario is merely a
ﬁrst step in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to Vermont, New
Hampshire, and Maine, including the fact that the companies have spoken
openly about the possible next phase to transport to Montreal and
Portland, Maine.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian tar
sands oil from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United
States. The full plan would have signiﬁcant impacts on the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands oil into the
United States. Tar sands oil results in more greenhouse gas pollution
than conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in
pipelines that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues
must be considered now because this project will open the door to
expanding the proj ect down the road. Don't let our environment be

Dear National Energy Board,
As a former resident of Maine, I am very concerned about the
"Trailbreaker" proposal by Enbridge. There are several
reasons to believe this current application to reverse part of Line 9
pipeline in Ontario is merely a ﬁrst step in a larger project to bring
Canadian oil to Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, including the fact
that the companies have spoken openly about the possible next phase to
transport to Montreal and Portland, Maine.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent proj ect,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian tar
sands oil ﬁom western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United
States. The full plan would have signiﬁcant impacts on the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands oil into the
United States, especially since it is primarily for export and will not
in any way help the US achieve "energy independence". Tar
sands oil results in more greenhouse gas pollution than conventional
oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines that can lead
to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be considered now
because this project will open the door to expanding the proj ect down
the road. Don’t let our environment be threatened by a piecemeal
process.
Many of us watched in sadness as Enbridge failed to have the capacity
to clean up the Kalamazoo River in Michigan recently. I would hate to
see beautiful Sebago polluted by the inevitable spill that this proj ect
will produce. Thank you for considering my comments.
Sincerely,
Ms. Sama Blackwell

bring tar sands oil into the US. and my state of Maine. I believe the
current application to reverse part of Line 9 pipeline in Ontario is
merely a ﬁrst step in attempting to bring Canadian oil to Vermont, New

Please consider whether the current proposal is a stand-alone project
or whether it is really part of a long-range plan to transport Canadian
tar sands oil to the United States. Bringing Canadian tar sands oil to

the climate, all factors that should be assessed before making a

Residents of Maine and other states strongly oppose bringing more tar
sands oil into the United States. Tar sands oil produces greater
greenhouse gas pollution than conventional oil and has acidic and
corrosive effects on pipelines that can lead to more ﬁequent spills.
These issues must be considered now.Please don't approve a proposal
that is targeted for enviromnentally damaging expansion in the
not-too-distant future. The citizens of the U.S., New England and my

Dear National Energy Board,
I oppose any plan to bring tar sands oil into my state of Maine. I am
very concerned that Enbridge’s cunent application to reverse part of
Line 9 pipeline in Ontario is merely a ﬁrst step in a larger project
to bring Canadian oil to Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.
The environmental impact of a full-scale tar sand oil project are
immense, and this current proposal must be assesed with a critical eye
as part of a larger project.
I ﬁrmly oppose the further deve10pment of tar sands oil as an energy
source for the United States (and Canada). Its extraction disrupts
vast tracts of key habitat, requires large inputs of energy, and leaves
behind serious pollution and deforestation. Its transport is more
dangerous that conventional oil, and is sure to generate highly '
polluting (and costly to clean up) spills, and leads to an end product .
that creates more greenhouse gas and so deepens the climate change i
crisis.
I am conﬁdent that a full review by the National Energy Board will
reveal that these enormous costs to the environment and the public far
outweigh any potential short-term proﬁt gains to Enbridge. There are
better ways to a secure energy future.

openly about the possible next phase to transport to Montreal and
Portland, Maine.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian tar
sands oil from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United

To my dear neighbors to the North with whom we share this part of the

that may could create a path for tar sands oil to be pumped across my
state, a fact that the beneﬁciary companies Who have as a duty to
their owners to keep costs to a minimum and proﬁts as high as
possible, have spoken openly about the possible next phase to transport
to Montreal and Portland, Maine.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian tar
sands oil from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United
States. The full plan would have signiﬁcant impacts on the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision. -
In researching this current proposal, I have true concerns that the
pumping of Tar sands oil, which contain higher acidic and corrosive
properties than what is currently ﬂowing through pipelines, as well as
my understanding that Tar sands oil is thicker and therefore will
subjugate the pipelines to operate under greater pressure that in .
itself can lead to more frequent spills. Further, the use of Tar sands
oil may result in more greenhouse gas pollution than conventional oil.
I request that these and other issues will be seriously considered now
before more time and money are expended and because this proj ect will
open the door to expanding the project down the road.
I trust your Board to what is best for all that live here in our part
of the world. Don't let our environment be threatened by a piecemeal

Subject: Enbridge Line 9 Reversal Phase I Proj ect Application under section 58 of the NEB Act
Hearing Order OH-005-2011
Dear National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands oil into the United States and
across my state. There are several reasons to believe this current
application to reverse part of Line 9 pipeline in Ontario is merely a
ﬁrst step in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to Vermont, New !
Hampshire, and Maine, including the fact that the companies have Spoken
openly about the possible next phase to transport to Montreal and
Portland, Maine. ~
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian tar
sands oil ﬁom western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United
States. The full plan would have signiﬁcant impacts on the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision. '
I There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands oil into the
United States. Tar sands oil results in more greenhouse gas pollution
! than conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in
pipelines that can lead to more frequent spills. TheSe and other issues
must be considered now because this project will open the door to
expanding the proj ect down the road. Don't let our environment be
threatened by a piecemeal process.

I think rushing through this decision without allowing time for citizens to gather information and review the process is
undemocratic and blatantly unfair. Governments are here to serve the people, not the corporations.
You originally suggested that the Hearings would be in the fall of 2012 to avoid disrupting necessary agricultural work
in the spring and summer, and to accommodate the required steps for participants
 Now you announced that the hearings were now to take place from May 23-25. Why the rush?
You have not provided citizens any information and seem to be trying to conduct these hearings on the sly. Why the
secret?
Two days is not long enough for citizens to voice their concerns. Why the hurry?
 There are legitimate concerns about the safety of a pipeline, some sections are thinner-walled than others, and
“abandonment in place” is not a reasonable option. Enbridge put the pipeline there and made billions from it, it is their
responsibility to remove the pipeline when they are through milking it dry.
Thank you for your time.

National Energy Board
Subject: Enbridge Pipelines Inc. (Enbridge) Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project (Project)
Sierra Club Canada wishes to register its objection to Enbridge Pipelines Inc. (Enbridge) Line 9 Reversal Phase I
Project (“Line 9 Reversal”).
Greenhouse Gas Emissions
 Canada has made a commitment to the international community to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as
50% by the mid century (2050) and 17% by 2020. It has committed to meeting these targets in part by regulating
industrial sectors. This has been well documented and often repeated by the Minister of Environment (Joe Oliver).
The Minister has not yet, however, proposed greenhouse gas regulations for the oil and gas sector. The National
Energy Board, therefore, as the agency responsible for determining the environmental impact of energy projects must
consider the possible long term greenhouse gas emission impacts of its decisions on Canada’s environment, on
Canada’s commitment to reduce emissions and on the industrial sectors it regulates.
Approving the Line 9 Reversal prior to the application of promised greenhouse gas regulations is premature. The
application should be set aside until after the regulatory regime for greenhouse gases has been applied.
National Energy Plan
It is well documented that the federal and provincial governments are discussing a national energy plan. These
discussions are ongoing and are, as yet, at a preliminary stage. Reversing the direction of an oil pipeline could have
significant impacts to a national energy plan. Therefore granting an approval at this stage in the development of a
national energy plan is premature.
Tanker Traffic in the St. Lawrence and the Bay of Fundy
The name “Enbridge Pipelines Inc. (Enbridge) Line 9 Reversal Phase 1” implies the proponent intends to do more than
merely reverse the flow of oil in the pipeline to Montreal. This project could reasonably be expected to result in
subsequent applications for the creation of export terminals in the Port of Montreal or St. John New Brunswick. The
potential impacts and risks of increasing tanker traffic in the St. Lawrence River and the Bay of Fundy require
extensive research to understand the risks and benefits. The proposed Line 9 reversal should not be approved until
this work is undertaken and the extent of the entire project is known, understood and well publicized.
Therefore approving this project is premature.
Sincerely,
John Bennett

Please withhold approval of Enbridge’s Line 9 reversal project
Body
 Re: OH-005-2011 - Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project
Attn: Ms. Young and Ms. Losier,
I am writing to express my objection to the Enbridge Line 9 reversal project in Ontario. The project
raises the threat of a pipeline spill in Ontario because it would mean transporting the oil at an increased
pressure, and would likely cause a shift to more polluting and corrosive tar sands oil. This poses a risk
to the ecosystems and health of Ontario residents.
I am also concerned that the project threatens Ontario’s energy security, cutting off imports from the
East, and increasing our dependence on oil from the tar sands.
I respectfully ask you to withhold approval of this project in order to preserve the safety and security of
Ontario’s environment and its residents.
Sincerely,
Angi Goodkey
Dear Canadian National Energy Board,
We are pleased to present you with this petition affirming one simple statement:
"Please oppose Enbridge's proposal to reverse a part of its Line 9 pipeline in Ontario, opening the door
to bring Canadian tar sands oil to Portland, Maine."
Attached is a list of individuals who have added their names to this petition, as well as additional comments
written by the petition signers themselves.
Sincerely,
Emily Figdor
                                                                                                              1

Portland Water District has no treatment which could remove crude oil from the drinking water. The pipeline
is more than 50 years old - condition unknown. This project must be opposed.

 My family's drinking water comes from Sebago Lake and the lake itself is enjoyed by residents and tourists all
year 'round. If this pipe were to leak, it would be devastating to the environment and is unacceptable.

While bringing the tar sands into Maine is not the issue at the moment - putting said tar sands into a 1950's era
pipeline seems far removed from a responsible method of transport. If you decide to bring the tar sands to
Portland, Maine, PLEASE build a new pipeline (that will create jobs in a VERY poor part of the US) that will
place the environmental concerns ahead of corporate profits, for a change!

I lived within a few miles of Sebago Lake for 20 years and recently was documenting the pipeline at its
closest proximity to the lake; within a few hundred yards. A highly toxic tar sands oil spill could potentially
devastate Portland's drinking water supply, and one of Maine's largest bodies of water. By all means, this
petition should be supported.

Subj ect: Enbridge Line 9 Reversal Phase I Proj ect Application under section 58 of the NEB Act
Hearing Order OH—005-2011 .
Dear National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually create a new pathway for tar .
sands oil into the United States and across my state. I live in the region around Sebago Lake Where the
pipeline passes by. There are several reasons to believe this current application to reverse part of Line
9 pipeline in Ontario is merely a ﬁrst step in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to Vermont, New
Hampshire, and Maine, including the fact that the companies have spoken openly about the possible
next phase to transport to Montreal and Portland, Maine. ' ‘
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project, or if it is actually part of a
longer—term plan to take Canadian tar sands oil from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the
United States. The full plan would have signiﬁcant impacts on the environment, waterways, and the
climate that should be assessed before making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands oiI into the United States. 'Iar sands oiI results
in more greenhouse gas pollution than conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in
pipelines that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be considered now because
this proj ect will open the door to expanding the proj ect down the road. Don't let our. environment be
' threatened by a piecemeal process.
Sincerely, ‘ _ 1

Subj ect: Enbridge Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project Application under section 58 of the NEB Act

Hearing Order OH—OOS-ZOH

Dear National Energy Board, _

I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually create a new pathway for tar .
sands oil into the United States and across my state. I live in the region around Sebago Lake where the
pipeline passes by. There are several reasons to believe this current application to reverse part of Line

9 pipeline in Ontario is merely a ﬁrst step in a larger proj eet to bring Canadian oil to Vermont, New -
Hampshire, and Maine, including the fact that the companies have spoken openly about the possible
next phase to transport to Montreal and Portland, Maine. .

I urge you to consider Whether this proposal is an independent proj eat, or if it is actually part of a ‘
longer~term plan to take Canadian tar sands oil from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the
United States. The full plan would have signiﬁcant impacts on the environment, waterways, and the '
climate that should be assessed before making a decision.

There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands oil into the United States. Tar sands oil results

in more greenhouse gas pollution than conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive propertiesin
pipelines that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be oonsiderednow because
this proj ect will» open the door toexpanding- the proj ect down the road. Don‘t let our environment be
threatened by a piecemeal process. _- -

Hearing Order OH-005—2011 -
Dear National Energy Board, '
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually create a new pathway for tar
sands oil into the United States and across my state. I live in the region around Sebago Lake Where the ‘
pipeline passes by. There are several reasons to believe this current application to reverse part of Line
9 pipeline in Ontario is merely a ﬁrst step in a larger proj eat to bring Canadian oil to Vermont, New
Hampshire, and Maine, including the fact that the companies have spoken openly about the possible
next phase to transport to Montreal and Portland, Maine. '
Iurge you to consider Whether this proposal is an. independent proj eat, or if it is actually part Of a
longer—term plan to take Canadian tar sands oil from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the
. United States. The full plan would have signiﬁcant impacts on the environment, waterways, and the
climate that should be assessed before making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands Oil into the United States. Tar sands oil results

sands oil into the United States and across my state. Ilive in the region around Sebago Lake Where the

Hampshire, and Maine, including the fact that the companies have spoken openly about the possible
next phase to transport to Montreal" and Portland: Maine. _ '
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent proj eat, or if it is actually part of a
longeruterm plan to take Canadian tar sands oil from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the '
United States. The full plan would have signiﬁcant impacts on the environment, waterways, and the
climate that should be assessed before making a decision.
There is growing opposition to bringing. more tar sands oil into the United States. Tar sands oil results
in more greenhouse gas pollution than conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in
pipelines that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be considered new because

Subject: Enbridge Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project Application under section 58 of the NEB Act
Hearing Order OH—005~2011
Dear National Energy Board,
_ I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually create a new pathway for tar
. sands oil into the United States and across my state. Ilive in the region around Sebago Lake where the
pipeline passes by. There are several reasons to believe this current application to reverse part of Line
9 pipeline in Ontario is merely a ﬁrst step in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to Vermont, New
Hampshire, and Maine, including the fact that the companies have spoken openly about the possible
next phase to transport to Montreal and Portland, Maine. _
I urge you to consider Whether this proposal is an independent proj ect, or if it is actually part of a
longer~term plan to take Canadian tar sands oil from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the
United States. The full plan would have signiﬁcant impacts on the environment, waterways, and the
climate that should be assessed before making. a decision. _
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands oil into the United States. Tar sands oil results '
_ in more greenhouse gas pollution than conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in
pipelines that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be considered now because
this proj ect Will open the doorto expanding the proj ect down the road. Don't let our environment be
threatened by a piecemeal process. ' -

Dear National Energy Board,
Please keep Tar Sands oil out of my backyard! ‘
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually .
create a new pathway for tar sands oil into the United States and
‘ across my state. In fact, the pipeline that would be reversed in this
proj ect goes essentially through my backyard in the foothills of
western Maine. ' i
There are several reasons to believe this current application to
' reverse part of Line 9 pipeline in Ontario is merely a ﬁrst step in a
larger proj eot to bring Canadian oil to Vermont, New Hampshire, and
Maine, including the fact that the companies have spoken openly about
the possible next phase to transport to Montreal and Portland, Maine.
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent proj eot,
or if it is actually part of a longer-tenn plan to take Canadian tar
sands oil from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United A
States. This would be devastating to the people and ecosystems in the
path of the pipeline and would not bring us any closer to ﬁnding a
comprehensive solution to climate change.
Tar sands oil results in more greenhouse gas pollution than
conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in pipelines
that can lead to more frequent spills. As a person who has grown up in .
‘ the spectacular outdoors of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, it is
unthinkable the damage that a Tar Sands oil leak could do to our ‘
» natural resources. Many people in my area depend on the outdoors for ' '
income and recreation and we would hate to see it spoiled by dirty Tar .
Sands oil. In addition, climate change has already begun to show its
harmful effects on our region. Please consider the risk of this project
and what it could mean to the people living in the path of the
pipeline. 0 ‘

Dear National Energy Board,
I am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually .
create a new pathway for tar sands oil into the United States and
across my state. There are several reasons to believe this current .
application to reverse part of Line 9 pipeline in Ontario is merely a
ﬁrst step in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to Vermont? New
Hampshire, and Maine, including the fact that the companies have spoken _ .
openly about the possible next phase to transport to Montreal and
Portland, Maine. ~
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer-term plan to take Canadian tar '
sands oil from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United
States. The full plan would have signiﬁcant impacts on the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before
making a decision. _
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands oil into the
United States. Tar sands oil results in more greenhouse gas pollution
than conventional oil and has acidic and corrOsive properties in
pipelines that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues
must be considered new because this project will open the door to

’ . expanding the proj ect down the road. Don’t let our environment be

Dear National Energy Board,
Enhridge’s application to reverse part of Line 9' concerns me greatly. ~
If this plan is part of a larger scheme to send Canadian oil through my
state, I will ﬁght it every” step of the way. The environmental impact '
of extracting oil from tar sands and transporting it through this '
pipeline is too signiﬁcant for me to ignore. ‘ Also, this oil
contributes disproportionately t0 greenhotlse gas emissions, putting us
further at risk for abrupt climate change. _
I see Enbridge’s application in the larger context of oil extraction,
transmission, and consumption, and I do not want to have my state to be
part of the tars sands oil distribution chain. ‘

Dear National Energy Board,
As an ecologist and environmental professional, and a Maine resident, I
am very concerned about a proposal by Enbridge that could eventually
create a new pathway for tar sands oil into the United States and '
across my homestate. There are several reasons to believe this current .
application to reverse part of Line 9 pipeline in Ontario is merely a
ﬁrst step in a larger proj ect to bring Canadian Oil to Vermont, New
Hampshire, and Maine, including the fact that the companies have spoken
openly about the possible next phase to transport to Montreal and .
Portland, Maine. '
As a member of the Raymond Conservation Commission and a resident of ‘
Raymond, Maine, I am very concerned about the posed threats and
possible impacts from a tar sands pipeline spi11 inthe lakes region
watershed of Sebago Lake and its tributaries and wetlands. Maine does
not have the funds or manpower to deal with a devastating tar sands
pipeline leak, spill or accident. It would essentially destroy the
natural resources of southern Maine and have an irreparable damaging .
effect on coastal resources, too; '
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent project,
or if it is actually part of a longer—term plan totake Canadian tar
sands oil from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the United
States. The full plan would have signiﬁcant impacts on the
environment, waterways, and the climate that should be assessed before ‘
making a decision. Given the terrible effects of tar sands on the
natural resources in Alberta, Canada, we can see the writing on the
wall. Let their mistakes be a warning to us, and proVide sound
reasoning to deny thisproject application. '
There is growing opposition to bringing more tar sands oil into the
United States. Tar sands oi1 resultsin more greenhouse gas pollution
than conventional oi1 and has acidic and corrosive properties in
pipelines that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues
must be considered new because this project will open the door to
eXpanding the proj ect down the road. Don’t let our environment be ' ‘

economic or ecological sense for Maine.

Subject: Enbridge Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project Application under section 58 of the NEB Act

Hearing Order OH~005~2011 ' - .

' Dear National Energy Board, ‘

I am very concerned about a proposal. by Enbridge that could eventually create a new pathway for ta:~

sands oil into the United States and across my state. I live in the region around Sebago Lake Where the ‘
pipeline passes by. There are several reasons to believe this current application to reverse part of Line

9 pipeline in Ontario is merely a ﬁrst step in a larger project to bring Canadian oil to Vermont, New
Hampshire, and Maine, including the fact that the companies have spoken openly about the possible .
next phase to transport to Montreal and Portland, Maine. ’
I urge you to consider whether this proposal is an independent proj eat, or if it is actually part of a
longer-nterm plan to take Canadian tar sands oil from western Canada to eastern Canada and then to the

' United States. The full plan wou1d have signiﬁcant impacts on the environment, waterways, and the '

climate that should be assessed before making a decision.

There is growing oppositiOn to bringing more tar sands oil into the United States Tar sands oil results

in more greenhouse gas pollution than conventional oil and has acidic and corrosive properties in

pipelines that can lead to more frequent spills. These and other issues must be considered new because _
this proj ect will open the door to expanding the proj ect down the road. Don‘t let Our environment be
threatened by a piecemeal process. ‘ . .

       Re:       Enbridge Pipelines Inc. (Enbridge) Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project (Project)
                 Application under section 58 of the National Energy Board Act (NEB Act)
                 Hearing Order OH-005-2011
        Secretary of the Board:
       The Conservation Law Foundation (“CLF”) submits these comments in opposition to Enbridge’s
       Application for Line 9 Reversal Phase 1 (“Phase 1”). CLF is a New England-based organization
       that has been working to protect the environment since 1966. CLF believes approval of the
       Phase 1 Application is not in the “public’ given the substantial risks associated with the
       apparent objective of the proposed project: transportation of tar sands crude oil from Sarnia to
       Portland, Maine.
       Enbridge has stated that Phase 1 is necessary “to meet the needs of shippers,” and to “supply the
       Ontario market with western Canadian crude oil.”         2 But these justifications appear pretextual in
       light of the fact that another pipeline already flows towards Westover, and likely provides
       sufficient crude to satisfy the area’s needs.3 In fact, sources have indicated that Phase 1 is not an
       isolated project, but is rather part of a more extensive project to bring tar sands from Alberta to
       Portland, Maine for export.
                                 4 This inference is supported by Enbridge’s (recently denied) request
       for permission to install a pumping station in Dunham, Quebec which would have facilitated
         National Energy Board Act § 52(e).

Enbridge states that the “potential adverse environmental or socio-economic effects [Phase 1] are
                                                           7 But the potential environmental
not likely significant, and are outweighed by the benefits....”
and socio-economic effects of the complete project are enormous. Phase 1 thus should not be
considered in isolation. Rather, the full effects of transporting tar sands crude from Alberta to
Portland should be considered at this time.
Regional Risks
The risks of transporting tar sands crude through pipelines are numerous. First, tar sands oil
(bitumen) is very dense, and must be diluted with natural gas condensate or other materials
(resulting in diluted bitumen, or “DilBit”) to be transported via pipeline. Second, DilBit’s
viscosity requires it to be channeled through pipelines at a higher speed, and the diluent may
change from liquid to gas at the high temperatures associated with this higher speed. Third,
DilBit is more acidic than conventional crude. These qualities may mean that transporting DilBit
through pipelines designed for lighter forms of crude poses comparatively higher risks of
pipeline corrosion and other safety problems.
                                           8
Finally, a DilBit oil spill will be more destructive than other spills because its heavy and viscous
qualities make it more difficult to clean up. For example, the Kalamazoo DilBit spill from an
Enbridge pipeline has taken much longer to clean up than anticipated, in large part due to the
submersion of heavy bitumen after the evaporation of natural gas diluents.
These risks are magnified because the complete project would transport DilBit to Portland
through old, timeworn pipelines. The Portland to Montreal 18 inch, which is likely to be
reversed in the complete project, is 62 years old. Transporting DilBit through this old pipeline
multiplies the risk of a spill to the thirteen rivers including the Androscoggin and Presumpscot

these watersheds would have devastating consequences to public health and the environment.
Worldwide Risks
In addition to the specific risks discussed above, the Sarnia-to-Portland pipeline reversal would
establish an export market for tar sands, which could result in ramped-up extraction. Tar sands

                                              , and every stage of tar sands production to crude
oil is energy-intensive and damaging to the environment. Extraction is achieved through either
pit mining, which entails chopping down forests and irreplaceably dredging up massive amounts
of earth, or in situ drilling, which leaves behind hundreds of square kilometers of wastewater
pools. In both, processing the bitumen into crude oil is an energy-intensive process that uses up
about one gallon of oil for every two gallons of crude produced.
Moreover, the energy-intensive extraction, processing, refining, and ultimate burning for energy
of the tar sands all emit copious amounts of greenhouse gas, which significantly contribute to
global warming. Establishing a pipeline for tar sands exportation and thereby increasing the
market for tar sands consumption is thus irresponsible not only for the Sarnia to Portland region,
but for the world at large. These localized and worldwide risks have triggered the much-
publicized public opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline proposed by TransCanada, and they
are equally applicable here.
For these reasons, CLF opposes Enbridge’s Part 1 Application and urges this Committee to deny
it.

       Please withhold approval of Enbridpe’s Line 9 reversal project
       Re: OH-005-201 1    - Line 9 Reversal Phase I Project
       Attn: Ms. Young and Ms. Losier,
       I am writing to express my objection to the Enbridge Line 9 reversal project in Ontario. The
       project raises the threat of a pipeline spill in Ontario because it would mean transporting the oil
       at an increased pressure, and would likely cause a shift to morc polluting and corrosive tar sands
       oil. This poses a risk to the ecosystems and health of Ontario residents.
       1 am also concerned that the project threatens Ontario’s energy security, cutting off imports from
       the East, and increasing our dependence on oil from the tar sands.          -
       I respectfully ask you to withhold approval of this project in order to preserve the safety and
       security of Ontario’s environment and its residents.
       There must be a better way!
       We need to be wiser than this...

         To: National Energy Board
        I respectfhlly submit these comments in opposition to Enbridge’s Application for Line 9
        Reversal Phase I (“Phase 1”). I am a resident of Portland, Maine my drinking water comes
                                                                                        —
        from Sebago Lake, some of the food I eat comes from local farms and Casco Bay, and I use
        Casco Bay and its islands for recreation. I believe that approval of the Phase I Application is not
        in the “public interest” given the substantial risks associated with the apparent objective of the
        proposed project: transportation of oil sands crude oil from Samia to Portland, Maine.
        I have been following the discussion about oil sands pipelines from Canada to the United States
        closely. In regard to Phase 1, Enbridge states that it is necessary to “supply the Ontario market
        with western Canadian crude oil.”  2 However, another pipeline already flows towards Westover,
        and likely provides sufficient crude to satisfy the area’s needs. This would make Phase 1
        unnecessary.
        3 What seems more likely is that Phase 1 is not an isolated project, but is rather part
        of a more extensive project to bring oil sands from Alberta to Portland, Maine for export.           4 This
       inference is supported by Enbridge’ s (recently denied) request for permission to install a
       pumping station in Dunham, Quebec which would have facilitated reversal of the Portland to
       Montreal pipeline.
                    5 In short; Enbridge appears to be using Phase I to get its foot in the door for
       later approval of a more controversial project.

           Enbridge states that the “potential adverse environmental or socio-economic effects [Phase 1] are
           not likely significant, and are outweighed by the benefits.. However, the potential
                                                                              .“
           environmental and socio-economic effects of the complete project are enormous. Phase 1 thus
           should not be considered in isolation. Rather, the full effects of transporting oil sands crude from
          Alberta to Portland must be considered at this time.
          Regional Risks
          The risks of transporting oil sands crude through pipelines are numerous. First, oil sands oil
          (bitumen) is very dense, and must be diluted with natural gas condensate or other materials
          (resulting in diluted bitumen, or “DilBit”) to be transported via pipeline. Second, DilBit’ S
          viscosity requires it to be channeled through pipelines at a higher speed, and the diluent may
          change from liquid to gas at the high temperatures associated with this higher speed. Third,
          DilBit is more acidic than conventional crude. These qualities mean that transporting DilBit
          through pipelines designed for lighter forms of crude poses comparatively higher risks of
          pipeline corrosion and other safety problems.
                                                    8
          Finally, a DilBit oil spill will be more destructive than other spills because its heavy and viscous
          qualities make it more difficult to clean up. For example, I am aware that the disastrous
          Kalamazoo DilBit spill from an Enbridge pipeline has taken much longer to clean up than
          anticipated, in large part due to the submersion of heavy bitumen after the evaporation of natural
         gas diluents. In addition, the people living near the Kalamazoo spill have had to leave their
         homes permanently due to contamination. In addition, many local businesses were forced to
         close for several months and were severely economically impacted. Portland has hundreds of
         local businesses that rely on tourism for their survival; they would probably not survive a DilBit
         oil spill.
         These risks are magnified because the complete project would transport DilBit to Portland
         through old, timeworn pipelines. The Portland to Montreal 18 inch, which is likely to be
         reversed in the complete project, is 62 years old. Transporting DilBit through this old pipeline
         multiplies the risk of a spill to the 13 rivers including the Androscoggin and Presumpscot it

                                                      , and every stage of oil sands production to crude
         oil is energy-intensive and damaging to the environment. Extraction is achieved through either
         pit mining, which entails chopping down forests and irreplaceably dredging up massive amounts
         of earth, or in situ drilling, which leaves behind hundreds of square kilometers of wastewater
         pools. In both, processing the bitumen into crude oil is an energy-intensive process that uses up
         about one gallon of oil for every two gallons of crude produced.
         Moreover, the energy-intensive extraction, processing, refining, and ultimate burning for energy
         of the oil sands all emit copious amounts of greenhouse gas, which significantly contribute to
         global warming. Establishing a pipeline for oil sands exportation and thereby increasing the
         market for oil sands consumption is thus irresponsible not only for the Sarnia to Portland region,
         but for the world at large. These localized and worldwide risks have triggered the much-
         publicized public opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline proposed by TransCanada, and they
         are equally applicable here.
         For these reasons, I strongly oppose Enbridge’s Part I Application and urge this Committee to
         deny it.
