Re: Letter of Comment by the Northwest Industrial Gas Users
Dear Ms. George:
The Northwest Industrial Gas Users (“NWIGU”) hereby submits its comments on the proposed
List of Issues in accordance with Hearing Order GH-OOl-2012, dated January 24, 2012.
NWIGU respectfully requests that the List of Issues be amended to include the following:
The toll methodology and the transportation commitments
appropriate for the Komie North Section.
NWIGU is a non-proﬁt trade association comprised of thirty-eight end-users of natural gas with
major facilities in the States of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho in the United States. NWIGU
members include diverse industrial interests, including food processing, pulp and paper, wood
products, aluminum, steel, chemicals, electronics, and aerospace. The association provides an
informational service to its members and participates in various regulatory matters that affect
member interests. NWIGU member companies purchase transportation services from Northwest
Pipeline GP (“Northwest Pipeline”), and from TransCanada’s Gas Transmission Northwest
Corporation (“GTN”) either directly or through capacity release from marketers, and except for
those industrial facilities directly connected to these interstate pipelines, the member companies

purchase sales and transportation services from local distribution companies that acquire service
from the pipelines.
NWIGU appreciates this opportunity to provide comments in this proceeding and requests that
communications in reference to these comments are addressed to:

As NWIGU member companies rely on both Westcoast and NGTL pipelines through their
respective interconnections with Northwest Pipeline and GTN, NWIGU members need both
upstream pipelines, i.e., Westcoast and NGTL, to maintain reasonable access to new gas supply
on a competitive basis. Accordingly NWIGU members have a signiﬁcant interest in a level
playing ﬁeld for those supplies to connect to the respective pipelines. Given the signiﬁcant
natural gas supplies in northeast British Columbia, and the concentration of industrial facilities
in the lnterstate-S corridor in the Paciﬁc Northwest that are served by supplies moved on
Westcoast’s system, NWIGU members will be impacted by how new pipeline facilities connect
gas reserves in northeast British Columbia.
Accordingly, NWIGU requests that the Board examine the toll methodology and the
transportation contract commitments pr0posed for the Komie North Section. NWIGU believes
that this issue merits examination by the Board in this proceeding. Competition between
Westcoast and NGTL to connect northeast British Columbia reserves should be on a level
playing ﬁeld. Although the Westcoast and NGTL pipeline systems are all regulated by the
Board, there are signiﬁcant differences between how these pipelines commercially develop new
pipelines to connect gas supplies in NE British Columbia. NWIGU supported Westcoast’s
August 5, 2011 application requesting that the Board conduct an inquiry into the appropriate
commercial basis for the development of new federal pipelines that would transport gas to

interconnections with existing pipeline systems in NE British Columbia. The Board denied
Westcoast’s request for an inquiry, but stated:
"Westcoast and any other parties that ﬁled submissions related to the Westcoast
request may actively participate in any future NGTL Part III or Part IV
applications to express their concerns. The Board has the discretion to include
Part IV matters in hearings on future Part 111 applications, where the Board ﬁnds
it relevant to do so."
F ile OF T 0115 Group] W102-2011-0201, Oct. 21, 2011 Letter of NEB I0 Westcoast.
NWIGU’S key concern is the availability of connected supply on the Westcoast system. The
Board Should examine whether the Komie North Section should be required to be developed
under a competitive model with negotiated stand-alone tolling and terms and conditions of
service like Westcoast or be allowed rolled-in tolling as proposed by NGTL.
If you have any questions regarding these comments, please call me at 503.636-2580. Thank I
you for your consideration of this matter.
Very truly yours, 5
