1.     The need for the Project
3.     The potential commercial impacts of the Project.
Alberta Northeast Limited ("ANE") represents a consortium of sixteen natural gas distribution companies (the
"ANE Shippers") located in six states in the Northeast region of the United States. The ANE Shippers include
Northern Utilities, Inc. ("Northern Utilities"), which is one of the expansion shippers underpinning the
Vaughan Mainline Expansion Project (the "Project") as set out in Table 3-1 of TransCanada’s Application.
Northern Utilities has signed a Precedent Agreement with TransCanada for 15 years of firm Mainline
transportation service with a contract demand of 6,333 GJ/d commencing November 1, 2017. As such, ANE is
directly affected by the Board’s decision and respectfully requests that the Board accept its application to
participate as a Commenter in this proceeding. ANE is strongly supportive of the Project. Approval of the
Project on a timely basis to enable TransCanada to complete the Project and provide expansion service by
November 1, 2017 is extremely important to ANE's member, Northern Utilities, in meeting its need for secure
and reliable natural gas supplies for its operations.

1.     The need for the Project
3.     The potential commercial impacts of the Project.
TransCanada Energy Ltd. (TCE) has executed a Clean Energy Supply ("CES") Contract with the Independent
Electricity System Operator (the “IESO”), previously the Ontario Power Authority, to build and operate a 900
MW natural gas-fired combined cycle electricity generating facility located in the Town of Greater Napanee,
Ontario (the “Napanee Generating Station” or “NGS”) and to supply electricity from NGS directly to the
Ontario market for a 20 year term. NGS will help ensure greater reliability of Ontario’s electrical system by
providing a reliable source of power to assist in meeting the daily supply needs of the province. NGS is
currently under construction and is expected to go into commercial operation late 2017 or early Q1-2018.
TCPL’s expansion facilities and the transportation service awarded to NGS under this application are essential
to the delivery of fuel from Parkway to NGS that is needed to generate electricity to meet Ontario’s electricity
demand and to satisfy TCE’s contractual obligations under the CES Contract with the IESO.
TCE respectfully submits to the Board the importance of the issuance of a timely approval of TCPL’s
expansion facilities allowing TCPL the necessary lead time to ensure these facilities are in service for Nov.
2017. Any delay in approval will put NGS at risk in achieving its planned commercial in-service date.

10. The terms and conditions to be included in any recommendation or approval the Board may issue for
       the Project
Atlantic Power Limited Partnership (APLP) is a subsidiary of Atlantic Power Corporation registered in British
Columbia. APLP owns and operates 8 power plants in Ontario and British Columbia. In Ontario, APLP has 4
gas powered and 1 biomass plants located in communities along the TransCanada Pipeline (TCPL) from
Nipigon in the west to North Bay in the east. APLP’s gas power plant in Tunis (near Cochrane) has a new 15
year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) to
commence in November, 2017. Gas will be sourced from Dawn through the Parkway interconnection point
to the Northern Distribution Area. The Vaughan expansion project is therefore an important infrastructure
that will allow TCPL to provide necessary capacity to transport gas from Dawn to the Parkway
interconnection point.
APLP strongly supports TransCanada’s Vaughan Mainline Expansion Project and needs the timely completion
of the project in order that it can meet the terms of the PPA with IESO.

Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) has a mandate to protect migratory birds as administrators
of the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994 and Migratory Bird Regulations (MBR), species at risk (SAR) as
administrators of the Species at Risk Act (SARA), water quality as administrators of the pollution prevention
provisions of the Fisheries Act, air quality and greenhouse gases as administrators of the Canadian
Environmental Protection Act, and preserve and enhance the quality of the natural environment as per the
Department of the Environment Act. Furthermore, ECCC promotes the conservation of wetlands as per The
Federal Policy on Wetland Conservation (FPWC).
With respect to Issue 4, ECCC will provide advice on potential environmental effects, including potential
cumulative environmental effects, as well as the significance of such effects of the project on migratory birds
and on terrestrial species at risk. ECCC will also provide advice on relevant mitigation measures.
ECCC’s comments would focus on potential environmental effects of the construction and installation of the
pipeline, its connections and associated facilities. Areas and affected areas where the approximate 11.7 km of
new right of way and temporary work space will be situated will be examined to ensure that areas of the
environment of concern to ECCC are protected.
A list of species at risk (SAR) observation records was provided to the proponent by ECCC. Further, ECCC had
direct communication with the proponent to address specific concerns with respect to the SARA-listed
Western Chorus Frog and Little Brown Myotis as they are likely to be impacted by the Project.
ECCC would ensure that adequate mitigation is provided in order to minimize the impact on migratory birds
including the Bobolink and Eastern Meadowlark.
ECCC may address the proponent’s assessment of significance of impacts on particular species.
ECCC will review the predictions of the project’s direct greenhouse gas emissions during construction and
operations phases.
With respect to Issue 9, ECCC may provide advice and information within its mandate on relevant accidents
and malfunctions.
With respect to Issue 10, ECCC may provide advice on the terms and conditions to be included in the approval
the Board may issue to the Project.

Dear Ms. Young,
RE:      TransCanada PipeLines Limited (TCPL) Vaughn Mainline Expansion Project
          File No. OF-Fac-Gas-T211-2015-05 01
          1853491 Ontario Inc., Vincenzo Ussia and 1116941 Ontario Limited
          TCE Comment Regarding the Request for Extension
TransCanada Energy Ltd. (“TCE”) has observed that the above-noted intervenors have requested an extension from April 18,
2016 to June 30, 2016 in which to make written submissions.
As indicated in TCE’s Application to Participate, TCE has entered into a Clean Energy Supply (“CES”) Contract with the
Independent Electricity Operator (“IESO”) to build and operate a nominal 900 MW natural-gas fired combined cycle electricity
generating facility located in the Town of Greater Napanee, Ontario (the “Napanee Generating Station” or “NGS”). NGS will
supply electricity to the Ontario market, providing a reliable source of power to assist in meeting the daily supply needs of the
province. NGS is currently under construction and is expected to go into commercial operation late 2017 or early Q1-2018.
TCE respectfully submits that granting the requested extension could negatively impact TCPL’s ability to meet the November 1,
2017 in-service date, requested and required by its customers. As such timely approval of these facilities is required and any
delay in approval will put NGS at risk in achieving its planned commercial in-service date.
Sincerely,

Dear Ms. Young:
Re:     TransCanada PipeLines Limited Section 58 Application for the Vaughan
        Mainline Expansion Project GH-001-2016 – Ussia Family Request to Submit
        Written Evidence
In the relatively short time since this issue arose, Alberta Northeast Gas Limited ("ANE")
canvassed its member utilities regarding the extent to which, if at all, they might be
affected by the Ussia Family request. ANE has only very recently been able to determine
that one of its members would be directly and adversely affected by the delay as more
fully detailed below.
In the circumstances ANE respectfully requests that the Board accept this late filed
submission. Given the nature of the other filed submissions, ANE respectfully submits
that the Ussia Family will not thereby be prejudiced.
Northern Utilities, Inc. is a natural gas utility located in Maine and New Hampshire in the
U.S. that has been a long standing customer of the TransCanada Pipeline and Union Gas
Pipeline. Northern Utilities, Inc. (“Northern”) has signed a Precedent Agreement with
TransCanada for 15 years of firm Mainline transportation service with a contract demand
of 6,333 GJ/d from Parkway to East Hereford commencing November 1, 2017. This
capacity is needed by Northern to enhance reliability and provide economic natural gas
supply for its customers.
Northern is very concerned that if the NEB grants the extension requested by the Ussia
Family, that the timely completion of the Vaughn Expansion project will be jeopardized,
which TransCanada states is needed in order to fulfill the capacity contract contemplated
by the Precedent Agreement. Northern subscribed for new capacity on TransCanada in
order to provide vital additional supply to Northern’s customers. The anticipated in service
date for the TCPL capacity within this path is November 1, 2017, as are the in service
dates for the corresponding upstream and downstream capacity on Union and PNGTS.
 Delays in the implementation of the new capacity contract with TransCanada
contemplated in the Precedent Agreement will harm Northern and our customers.
Therefore, Northern urges the NEB to deny the request by the Ussia Family to extend the
review process of the Vaughn Expansion laid out in Hearing Order GH-001-2016.
ANE is copying this submission to the Ussia Family and its counsel to ensure its timely
receipt prior to their response.
Yours truly,
(Original Signed By)

Dear Ms. Young:
Re: TransCanada PipeLines Limited ("TransCanada")
       Application for the Vaughan Mainline Expansion Project
       National Energy Board ("NEB" or "Board") Hearing Order GH-001-2016
       Alberta Northeast Gas Limited Letter of Comment
A.       INTRODUCTION
Pursuant to Hearing Order GH-001-2016, Alberta Northeast Gas Limited ("ANE") is filing
this letter of comment.
ANE represents a consortium of sixteen natural gas distribution companies (the "ANE
Shippers") located in six states in the Northeast region of the United States. The ANE
Shippers include Northern Utilities, Inc. ("Northern"), which is one of the expansion
shippers underpinning the Vaughan Mainline Expansion Project (the "Project") as set out
in Table 3-1 of TransCanada's Application. 1
B.       NORTHERN UTILITIES
Northern is a natural gas utility located in Maine and New Hampshire in the U.S. that has
been a long standing customer of the TransCanada and Union Gas Limited ("Union")
pipeline systems. Northern contracted for 6,333 GJ of capacity from Parkway to East
Hereford through TransCanada's New Capacity Open Season in 2015. This capacity
necessitates the Project, and is part of a pipeline path within Northern's portfolio that
includes upstream capacity on Union and downstream capacity on the Portland Natural
Gas Transmission System ("PNGTS"). Northern subscribed for new capacity on Union
and PNGTS in order to complete this path that is vital to supplying Northern's customers.
The anticipated in-service date for the TransCanada capacity within this path is November
1, 2017, as are the in-service dates for the corresponding upstream and downstream
capacity on Union and PNGTS.

C.         EVIDENCE
ANE has reviewed the commercial evidence filed in the proceeding (not evidence related
to land and routing issues). In particular, ANE has reviewed the evidence of Enbridge
Gas Distribution Inc. ("EGD"), 2 Sociéte en commandite Gaz Métro ("Gaz Métro"), 3 St.
Lawrence Gas Company Inc. ("SLG")4 and Union. 5 All of these parties are prospective
shippers on the applied-for facilities.
Of note, these parties are unanimous in their position that time is of the essence with
respect to receiving a decision on the Application. 6 They share ANE's sense of urgency,
communicated in ANE's Application to Participate 7 and previous process comments, 8 that
a decision be forthcoming in a timely manner so as to enable service to commence by
the in-service date of November 1, 2017.
As noted above, TransCanada's applied-for capacity forms part of a transportation chain
for Northern, including both connecting upstream and downstream capacity. In this
respect, ANE agrees with and supports the position of EGD that "Coordination of
infrastructure development is in the public interest…" 9
ANE also agrees with and supports the following Union position:
           The North American natural gas market continues to evolve with further
           development of the Appalachian Basin, requiring significant infrastructure
           investment to satisfy increased market demand for short‐haul
           transportation. This infrastructure investment is supported by long‐term
           contracting commitments from shippers who are looking to gain access to
           new sources of supply that are located closer to their markets. Any delay to
           the in‐service dates for these projects creates uncertainty, inefficiencies,
           and is harmful to the natural gas market as a whole. 10
D.         CONCLUSION
ANE respectfully requests that the National Energy Board provide an expeditious
approval of the Project so that the in-service date of November 1, 2017 can still be met.
Without this capacity, Northern will have stranded capacity upstream on Union and faces
a risk to the reliability of supply on its utility system.

                                                 Comments
TransCanada Energy Ltd. (TCE) has executed a Clean Energy Supply ("CES") Contract with the Independent
Electricity System Operator (the “IESO”), previously the Ontario Power Authority, to build and operate a 900
MW natural gas-fired combined cycle electricity generating facility located in the Town of Greater Napanee,
Ontario (the “Napanee Generating Station” or “NGS”). The Napanee Generating Station will directly supply
electricity to the Ontario market for a 20 year term. NGS will help ensure greater reliability of Ontario’s
electrical system by providing a reliable source of power to assist in meeting the daily supply needs of the
province. NGS is currently under construction and is expected to start commissioning activities in Q3-2017
with a commercial operation date in early Q1-2018.
TCPL’s expansion facilities and the transportation service awarded to NGS under this application are essential
to the delivery of fuel from Parkway to NGS that is needed to generate electricity to meet Ontario’s
electricity demand and to satisfy TCE’s contractual obligations under the CES Contract with the IESO.
As the Board will note, at 142,000 GJ* , TCE is the largest shipper underpinning this Project. TCE’s
commitment is approximately 47.5% of the total requests for new Firm Transportation Service (and ~33% of
all new service requests).
In light of the foregoing, TCE respectfully submits to the Board the importance of the issuance of a timely
approval of TCPL’s expansion facilities allowing TCPL the necessary lead time to ensure these facilities are in
service for November 1, 2017. Any delay in approval will put NGS at risk in achieving its planned commercial
in-service date and may result in additional impacts to Ontario’s anticipated electricity supply.

    Dear Ms. Young
    RE: Hearing Order GH-001-2016        - TransGanada Pipelines Ltd. Vaughan Mainline
    Expansion Project
    Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) has a mandate to protect migratory
    birds, species at risk (SAR), and to uphold water and air quality. As such, ECCC is
    providing specialist, expert information with regards to the Vaughan Mainline Expansion
    project in accordance with these regulatory and program responsibilities:
         a   Migratory Birds Convention Act, f 994 (MBCA)
         I   Migratory Bird Regulations (MBR)
         a   Species at Risk Act (SARA)
         o   Can adi an Environmental Protection Act
         a   Department of the Environment Act
    ECCC has reviewed the project information submitted by the proponent, consisting of its
    Application, Environmentaland Socio-Economic Assessment (ESA) (November 2015)
    and response to the National Energy Board's (NEB)(lR) No.1 (April 8, 2016).
    This Letter of Comment serves to provide recommendations to the NEB with the goal of
    avoiding or minimizing the potential adverse effects on areas of the environment relating
    to ECCC's mandate.
    General
    It is our understanding that the pipeline is to be located within a highly disturbed and
    fragmented landscape containing areas covered underOntario's Greenbelt Plan. The project
    fooþrint is composed of intensive agriculture, residential, isolated woodlots and remnant
    natural areas such as the Nashville Resource Management Tract which includes riparian
    wetland and upland corridors.
    Our analysis indicates that the proponent has endeavored to minimize the project's
    effects on wildlife populations and habitat in five key ways:
             The proposed projectfooþrint is immediately adjacent to or within existing linear
             disturbance features such as hydro transmission and road corridors, as well as in
                                                                                               t*I
          agriculturalareas where a new pQectfooþrint is required.
         Horizontal directionaldrilling methods are proposed for approximately 24o/o of the
         pipeline length where it traverses naturalareas such as the Nashville Resource
         Management Tract, or roads that cannot be avoided. Staging areas for horizontal
         directionaldrilling are located within existing agriculturalareas or disturbed areas,
         thereby minimizing or eliminating disturbance within most naturalareas.
         Timing of construction activities is proposed to avoid the removal of habitat during
         key wildlife life cycle stages.
         Measures will be implemented to detect and exclude wildlife from areas with
         active construction.
         Rehabilitation to the existing projectfooþrintwith nat¡nalvegetation is proposed, which
         may provide habitat for wildlife.
In consideration of the value of the landscape in the project study area to migratory birds,
and with the implementation of the proponent's proposed mitigation measures, as well as
the application of the following advice and recommendations, ECCC is of the opinion
that the project will not result in adverse effects on migratory birds.
As currently proposed, the project will likely result in adverse ímpacts on the Western
Chorus Frog (Great Lakes/ St. Lawrence- Canadian Shield Population), which is
designated as a species at risk under the federal SARA. In the absence of additional
information, it appears there is a high likelihood of harming, harassing or killing
individuals, damaging or destroying residences, and destroying critical habitat for this
species. More detailed comments on these aspects are provided in the following
sections.
Migratory Birds
The MBCA prohibits the deposit of a substance that is harmfulto migratory birds in
waters or an area frequented by migratory birds or in a place from which the substance
may enter such waters or such an area. The MBCA also prohibits the possession of a
migratory bird, nest or egg without lavuful excuse. The MBR prohibits attempting in any
manner to kill, injure or harass migratory birds, as well as the disturbance,
destruction, or taking of a nest, egg or nest shelter of a migratory bird.
Migratory bird individuals and habitat occur within and adjacent to the project site. As
such, project activities including construction access, site grubbing, vegetation clearing,
construction and maintenance activities pose a threat to migratory birds and must be
undertaken in a manner that avoids contravening the MBCA and its regulations.
It is recommended that the proponent pay particular attention to the advice at the
referenced website: Determining the Presence of Nesfs (see weblink below). While nest
searching is not recommended by ECCC in most situations, there are exceptions.
Below is some additional background information on nest searching along with
alternatives and measures to help avoid contravening the MBCA.
      1. ECCC does not recommend         the use of nest surveys to determine whether nests
         are present (with the exception of a few circumstances, e.9., nests in open areas,
         when the birds nest on isolated trees, on man-made structures and/ or in
         colonies). The risk of disturbing nests (which is a contravention of the MBCA) is
                                                  2
          high during nest surveys. Additionally, there is a high probability of obtaining false
         negatives during nest surveys (i.e., a survey will determine that there are no nests
         present when in actuality there are nests in the surveyed habitat).
         a)  For forested habitats, ECCC considers "non-intrusive searching methods" such
             as using point counts placed along transects more in line with our advice on
             determining whether nests are present in an area. These methods use singing
             territorial males as a proxy to establish whether the breeding season has
             started.
         b)  ECCC does not recommend establishing buffers around any nests identified
             through nest surveys. Because ECCC recommends non-intrusive searching
             methods in most instances, buffers are generally only appropriate as an
             avoidance toolwhen nests are easily identified (such as nests in open areas,
             when the birds nest on isolated trees, on man-made structures and/ or in
             colonies). ln other habitats, it is unlikely that nest surveys will detect all nests
             and thus buffers will not be established around all nests that are actually in
             the habitat.
    2.   ECCC does not recommend marking active nests with flagging tape, painted
         lath, or other similar material as this increases the risk of nest predation.
    3.   ln circumstances where nests are readily identified and can be monitored
        without disturbance to the nest, the proponent should consider submitting any
         completed nest records to the Ontario Nest Records Scheme.
Mioratorv Bird Protection Recommendations
ECCC recommends hat the proponent:
   1.  Develop and implement a management plan that avoids or minimizes the risk of
       negative effects to migratory birds, their nests and eggs.
   2.  Consult the guidance provided in the referenced websites relating to migratory birds
       (see weblinks below).
Species at Risk
Under the SARA, the federal government is required to identify critical habitat for
threatened and endangered species and for extirpated species if recovery is deemed
feasible. ECCC understands that the NEB, through internal policy, applies section 79 of
SARA to decisions under s.58 of the National Energy Board Act.
Subsection 79 of SARA provides:
        79 (1) Every person who is required by or under an Act of Parliament to ensure that an
        assessment of the environmental effects of a project is conducted, and every authority who makes
        a determination under paragraph 67(a) or (b) of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act,
                                                     3
          2012 in relation to a project, must, without delay, noti! the competent ninister or ministers in
         writing of the project if it is likely to affect a listed wildlife species or its critical habitat.
         (2) The person must identifr the adverse effects of the project on the listed wildlife species and its
         critical habitat and, if the project is canied out, must ensure that measures are taken to avoid or
         lessen those effects and to monitor them. The measures must be taken in a way that is consistent
         with any applicable recovery strategy and action plans.
Since the NEB is reviewing the project application under section 58 of the National Energy
Board Acf, the NEB is also required to fulfill subsection 77(1) of SARA, which provides:
          Despite any other Act of Parliament, any person or body, other than a competent minister, authorized
         under any Act of Parliament, other than this Act, to lssue or approve a licence, a permit or any other
         authorization that authorizes an activity that may result in the destruction of any part of the critical
         habitat of a listed wildlife species may enter into, issue, approve or make the authorization only if the
          person or body has consulted with the competent minister, has considered the impact on the species'
         critical habitat and is of the opinion that,
               a)   all reasonable alternatives to the activity that would reduce the impact on fhe specles'
                    critical habitat have been considered and the best solution has been adopted; and
               b)   all feasible measures will be taken to minimize the impact of the activity on the species'
                    critical habitat.
Critical habitat is the habitat that is necessary for the survival or recovery of a listed
wildlife species and that is identified as the species' critical habitat in the recovery
strategy or in an action plan for the species.
To assist the NEB in fulfilling its subsection 77(1) and section 79 responsibilities of the
SARA, ECCC is providing detailed information and advice about the Western Chorus
Frog.
WesternChorusFroo, Great Lakes/ St. Lawrence- Canadian Shield Population
lndividuals and Residences
Critical habitat is partially identified in the final recovery strategyfor the Western Chorus
Frog, Great Lakes/ St. Lawrence - Canadian Shield Population, herein referred to as
Western Chorus Frog, to the extent possible using the best available information. The
identification of critical habitat for the Western Chorus Frog is based on two criteria:
habitat occupancy and habitat suitability.
Habitat occupancy is established by selecting the data obtained from point counts
conducted during the breeding period and other records:
.   dating from the year 1992 or later; and
¡    covering at least two separate years within a 20-year period, with at least 1 of the
     records dating from the last decade.
Suitable habitat is described by the biophysical attributes of habitats where individuals
can meet the needs associated with the various stages of their life cycle (e.9. mating,
egg-laying, tadpole metamorphosis, foraging, hibernation, dispersal)in Canada. For
aquatic stages, all areas of suitable breeding wetlands up to 300 m from a record are
considered critical habitat. For terrestrial stages, all areas of suitable habitat are
incorporated up to 300 m from the boundaries of critical habitat for aquatic stages to
allow for the completion of the species' annual life cycle.
                                                                4
 To maintain connectivity between local populations and sustain the processes essential
for the persistence of metapopulations, the recovery strategy also includes dispersal
habitats as part of the critical habitat. They correspond to the areas of suitable habitat up
to 300 m from any dispersal habitat type connecting two breeding wetlands that meet the
habitat occupancy criteria and that are separated by a maximum distance of 900 m. Until
more information is known about local habitat use by the species, dispersal habitat
identified as critical habitat is bounded by minimum convex polygons encompassing
local populations that form a metapopulation. These polygons are based on the known
dispersal distances provided above and are referred to as critical habitat units.
Although individuals may only occupy a small portion of suitable habitat within a critical
habitat unit at any given time, the entire suitable habitat complex within the unit is
identified as critical habitat. This consideration is particularly important given that the
locations of local populations have been observed to shift over a relatively short period
of time and that the data used to map critical habitat provide only a snapshot of the
situation in time. Any anthropogenic structures (e.9., houses, paved surfaces) and any
areas (e.9. drained agriculturalfields, sewage treatmenlsettling ponds) that do not have
the characteristics of suitable habitat for the Western Chorus Frog are not identified as
critical habitat.
An area that contains critical habitat has been identified within the project footprint.
Correspondence between ECCC and the proponent's consultants occurred on
September 4,2015 before the final Western Chorus Frog's recovery strategy was
posted as final on December 1, 2015. The proponent may not be aware that critical
habitat is identified within the project site.
A table providing a description of biophysical attributes of suitable habitat for the life
cycle stages of the Western Chorus Frog can be used by the proponent to collect and
provide the appropriate information to ECCC (see table referenced below).
Advice on Effects to Critical Habitat
As described above, the NEB is required under subsection 77(1) of the SARA to consider
the impact of the project on the species' critical habitat and must be of the opinion that all
reasonable alternatives to the activity that would reduce the impact on the species' critical
habitat have been considered and the best solution has been adopted. Furthermore,
under subsection 77(1) the NEB must be of the opinion that all feasible measures will be
taken to minimize the impact of the activity on the species' critical habitat. Western
Chorus Frog individuals rely on temporary wetlands or the shallow portions of permanent
wetlands as well as lowlands such as pastures, shrublands, meadows, clearings and
fallow lands within suitable habitat in order to complete their lifecycle. The Western
Chorus Frog also has considerable difficulty adapting to habitat fragmentation and
reduced habitat quality. The species has relatively low mobility, tends to return to ponds
where they were born and the number of breeding frogs fluctuates greatly on an annual
basis, depending on water availability. As a result, if a reduction in habitat quality or
availability coincides with a natural decrease in the number of individuals, local extinction
is very likely.
There is some uncertainty with respect to the exact location of suitable habitat within the
identified polygons. ln particular, the breeding wetlands are not mapped in an accurate or
                                                  5
 consistent way in current land-use classification frameworks because of limitations due to
minimum mappable units (e.9., occupied wetlands are often very small), discernibility of
elements (e.9., difficulty of detecting suitable features under tree canopies or shrubs), or
frequency of updating the data (e.9., hydroperiod variability from year to year results in
occupied habitat not always being static in space). As a result, ground-based survey
information must be used to verify the exact location of suitable habitat.
For that reason, the NEB should require the proponent to provide further
information to ECCC in order to confirm the exact location of suitable habitat.
Specifically, GIS files are required by ECCC (in shapefile or ESRI geodatabase
format) that identify areas of occurrence (based on call feedback heard during the
breeding season) and habitat mapping that includes suitable habitat, including
biophysical attributes, verified through the collection of field-based information
that addresses the temporal hydrology (e.9., wet seasons/ intermittent ponds,
high water marks) of the area.
Once the exact location of suitable habitat is confirmed within the project footprint, the
exact location of critical habitat will also be confirmed. ECCC advises the NEB to
inform the proponent that ECCC should be consulted in order to provide
additional advice at that time. ln any case, as a result of the variety of habitat types
found within critical habitat, and that it will be difflcult or impossible to recreate or restore
the function of critical habitat, the NEB should inform the proponent that avoiding
the damage or destruction of critical habitat is the best approach to reduce the
impact of a project on a species' critical habitat (i.e. through pipeline micro
rôuting or horizontal directional drilling). lf ¡t is not reasonably possible to avoid
critical habitat, the NEB should ensure the best solution amongst other
alternatives that would reduce the impact on species' critical habitat has been
adopted.
The Schedule of studies to identify critical habitat (Section 7.2 of the Westem Chorus
Frog's recovery strategy) includes actions which the NEB may want to consider
requiring of the proponent to help it meet its s.77 responsibilities. These include
conducting surveys and/ or obtaining data for areas known to support a local population
but where additional information is required (e.9., locations containing poor spatial
accuracy of information, or only one year of information; locations which only partly meet
the critical habitat identification criteria and monitoring and evaluating use of created or
restored habitats by the Western Chorus Frog).
Advice on Effects to lndividuals and Residences
With critical habitat occurring within the projectfooþrint, there is a strong possibilitythat
Western Chorus Frog individuals and residences wilJ occur within the project footprint
and be impacted. Consistent with subsection 79(2) of SARA, the NEB will need to
ensure these impacts are avoided or lessened and monitored. The proponent has
proposed measures to detect and exclude individuals and residences from areas where
construction activities will be taking place. Since detection and exclusion have been
found to be harmful to more individuals and residences than are located or excluded,
ECCC advises the NEB not to accept the proponent's proposed approach on this
aspect. lnstead, if work must be undertaken within areas where Western Chorus Frog
individuals occur, the NEB should require that such activities only occur outside
of a 300 m radius from any pond occupied by Western Chorus Frog. Work
                                                  6
 should also be conducted only during the breeding period while frogs are
restricted to the pond (and would thus be avoided) so as to reduce the likelihood
of negatively affecting Western Ghorus Frog individuals and residences. Any work
conducted within 300 m of a breeding pond occupied by Western Chorus Frogs has the
potential to kill, harm or harass individuals of the species.
Western Chorus Frogs have two types of residences- breeding sites and hibernating
sites. Western Chorus Frogs breed in temporary wetlands or shallow portions, which
become dry in the summer, of permanent aquatic features (e.9., ponds, basins/
potholes, marshes, swamps, drainage ditches). Egg masses are attached to
vegetation or twigs (although they may simply sink below the surface of the water).
The submerged plant, dead grass stem or twig on which the eggs are deposited is
considered a breeding site.
Although Western Chorus Frog breeding sites occupy very limited areas, they can be
distributed throughout the wetlands within which they occur. These wetlands have
been shown to range from 0.001 to 6 ha in Quebec. The same wetlands or aquatic
features are generally used from year to year to house Western Chorus Frog breeding
sites. Accordingly, any wetland or aquatic feature occupied or known to have been
occupied by Western Chorus Frog during any life stages is considered as containing
at least one occupied residence. Thus, it is not necessary to confirm the presence or
exact location of a breeding site; this is not advisable since confirming the presence of
breeding sites is also very likely to damage or destroy them.
Even though the remainder of the wetland or aquatic feature within which the breeding
site is found is not considered part of the residence, it is needed to maintain the
essential characteristics and function of the breeding site. Temporary wetlands or
shallow portions, which become dry in the summer, of permanent aquatic features
(e.9., ponds, basins/potholes, marshes, swamps, drainage ditches) provide the
conditions (e.9., range of temperatures, hydroperiod - presence of water in the habitat,
residual vegetation) required for the eggs to develop into tadpoles.
Depending on weather conditions, the Western Chorus Frog will start breeding as soon
as the end of March. Once the eggs are laid (end of March to mid-May), it takes 3 to 27
days for them to hatch into tadpoles depending on temperature. Accordingly, a breeding
site can be occupied (i.e. eggs are present) starting March 20th until June 11th. To
ensure that breeding sites are available from one year to the next and to maintain the
functionality of the breeding site, the ecological integrity of wetlands and aquatic features
containing a breeding site must be maintained. As such, activities which may damage or
destroy the breeding site include those which directly affect the breeding site as well as
those which affect the wetlands or aquatic features and therefore the functionality of the
breeding site. Damage or destruction to the breeding site by way of these latter activities
can occur at any time during the year.
Western Chorus Frog hibernation takes place in terrestrial habitats (e.9., lowlands such
as pastures, clearings, meadows, fallow lands, shrublands, wooded areas) in soft soil
substrates, under rocks, dead trees/branches, leaves/litter or in existing burrows (Froom
1982). Any one of these sites used by hibernating Western Chorus Frogs is considered a
hibernating site. In Canada, the Western Chorus Frog generally hibernates from October
to March depending on weather conditions. Accordingly, a hibernating site can be
occupied from October 1st to March 20h. Although the entirety of the terrestrial habitat
                                                7
 within 300 m of the occupied wetland or aquatic feature is not considered as being the
residence, it is needed to maintain the essential characteristics and function of the
hibernating site. Western Chorus Frog individuals have limited capacity to respond to
disturbance during hibernation, and hibernating sites may be selected to reduce
vulnerability to weather events.
To ensure that hibernating sites are available from one year to the next and to maintain
the functionality of the hibernating site, the ecological integrity of the terrestrial habitat
containing residences must be maintained. Activities which may damage or destroy the
hibernating site include those which directly affect the hibernating site as well as those
which affect the terrestrial habitat within 300 m of an occupied wetland or aquatic feature
and therefore the functionality of the hibernating site. Damage or destruction to the
hibernating site can occur at any time during the year. Western Chorus Frog populations
can be connected by processes of migration, genetic exchange and colonization, such
that these populations are highly dependent on connections with other local populations
of the species. The interconnected nature of local Western Chorus Frog populations is a
key element to maintaining genetic diversity and to providing resilience from natural or
anthropogenic disturbances (i.e., they are important for maintaining the ability of Western
Chorus Frog to recover from natural or anthropogenic disturbances). This
interconnectedness is particularly important for Westem Chorus Frog survival and
recovery within highly disturbed and fragmented landscapes.
Little Brown Mvotis. Northern Mvotis. Tri-colored Bat
The Little Brown Myotis, Northern Myotis and Tri-colored Bat were emergency listed as
Endangered on Schedule 1 of SARA in 2014 because of sudden and dramatic declines
across the eastern portions of their range; they are also listed provincially under the
Endangered Species Acf. The proposed recovery strategyforthese species was posted to
the SAR Public Registry on December 24,2015.
Based on the information provided by the proponent and verified by the Ontario Ministry of
Natural Resources and Forestry, suitable habitat is unlikely to exist within the project
footprint and therefore the project is unlikely to affect the Little Brown Myotis, Northem Myotis or
Tri-colored Bat.
We understand the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry has engaged the
proponent to minimize effects of the project on these species if they occur.
Other Species at Risk
More information on species at risk that may be affected by the project can be found on ECCC's
website (see references below).
Species at Risk Protection Recommendations
ECCC reæmmends ürat the proponent:
   3.  Confirm the exact location of the Western Chorus Frog's suitable habitat by
       collecting ground-based survey information. The information required is GIS file(s)
                                                   I
         (Shapefile or ESRI Geodatabase) identifying areas of occurrence (based on call
        feedback heard during the breeding season) and habitat mapping that includes
        suitable habitat, including BiophysicalAttributes verified through the collection of
        field-based information that addresses the temporal hydrology (e.9., wet seasons/
        intermittent ponds, high water marks) of the area (see references below). This
        information is to be provided to ECCC.
   4.   Consult with ECCC once the location of suitable habitat and critical habitat is
        confirmed.
   5. Avoid damage      or destruction of the Western Chorus Frog's critical habitat.
   6.   Undertake project activities outside of a 300 m radius from any pond occupied by a
        Western Chorus Frog (if work must be undertaken within areas where Western
        Chorus Frog individuals occur).
Air Quality & Greenhouse Gases (GHGs)
The Project has the potential to adversely affect air quality and to emit GHGs. During the
construction phase, activities such as trenching, pipe stringing and bending, welding and
coating, along with the operation of vehicles and machinery required to carry out such
activities, generate fugitive dust and heat exhaust. The emissions generated from such
sources include: suspended particulate matter (SPM), PMro, PMz.s, NOx, SOz, CO and
GHGs. The operational phase of the project will also emit air contaminants related to
fugitive dust from on and off-road equipment, fossil fuel combustion from site-specific
maintenance activities, such as venting for pressure release (i.e. blowdowns) and aerial
patrols of the pipeline.
Other potential sources of emissions of air contaminants and GHGs which were not
identified by the proponent, include the emissions from compressor and pumping stations,
combustion of natural gas for turbine or pump operation, use of auxiliary generators or
other sources of electricity to power the station, fugitive emissions (VOCs) and
hydrocarbons (CHa) from leaks from seals, flanges, valves and other connections or gas
dehydrators.
ECCC understands that the proponent has received approval from the NEB to modify the
existing TransOanada Maple Compressor Station (Station 130). However, the original
capacity of the compressor station, nor the effects of its modification/ expansion
accommodating for an increased capacity, were not made explicit in this ESA for this
project.
The proponent has predicted the importance of air emissions, consisting of both criteria air
contaminants (CACs) and GHGs, with respect to residual effects to be negligible (Table
5.10-8). This prediction is made based on professionaljudgement and based on
experience with other similar pipeline projects across Canada. Similarly, for the
cumulative effects assessment, professionaljudgment is used to state that when the
project's emissions are combined with background air quality, relevant criteria would not
be exceeded. ECCC would prefer an approach of quantifying air quality and GHG
emissions in order to provide a more robust basis for applying professionaljudgment with
respect to their potential effects.
                                                 9
 Air Qualitv & GHG Recommendations
ECCC recommends that the proponent:
   7.   Provide an air quality assessment for all phases of the project (on a phase by phase
        basis), as well as a cumulative effects assessment using standardized dispersion
        modelling. The assessments should incorporate all major sources of emissions,
        including activities related to construction and operation of the pipeline, as well as
       activities related to the compressor station (as part of the cumulative effects
       assessment). The assessments should be based on a conservative/ worst-case
       scenario with a focus on main pollutants of concern such as NOx, TSP, PMls and
        PMz.s, CO (for the 1-hr and 24-hr averaging periods) and VOCs where applicable.
       The assessments should also include the identification of any mitigation measures
       that might be required to reduce any adverse air quality effects.
   8.   Provide an estimation of the direct GHG emissions for all phases of the project.
   9.   ldentify sensitive receptors within the local study area and conduct an air quality
       assessment on the sensitive receptors within 5 km of project stations. The air
       quality assessment should include fìgures with isopleths showing the location of
        receptors relative to the project and show where maximum concentrations of
        particular CACs occur (including, but not limited to SPM, PMle and PMz.s).
   10. ECCC agrees with the proponent's commitment to manage air emissions by
       following standard mitigation and management practices as per the proposed
        mitigation measures in Table 5.10-7: Potential Effects, Mitigation, and Predicted
        Residual Effects of the Project on Air Emissions; and in Appendix 10-1: lnteractions
       Table. However, ECCC recommends that the proponent provide details in terms of
       the objectives of air quality mitigation measures, and the effìciency of mitigation
        measures (used for modelling), listing the applied methods and the conditions that
       trigger mitigation measures. ECCC also recommends that the proponent
        incorporate record keeping of the frequency of adopted mitigation measures and
        related actions.
   11. lncorporate the practices, based on the regulations and codes of practice
       (referenced below) into their Best Management Plan for dust, CACs and GHGs and
       other mitigative actions.

Migratory Birds
General Nesting Periods of Migratory Birds in Canada: ECCC has compiled core
nesting periods to allow for work to be done outside of the nesting period. This does not
mean there would not be nesting birds outside of these periods; it only reduces the risk
of encountering a nest.
