                The Group I am representing is directly affected by the proposed Project
            ; The Group I am representing has relevant information or expertise
                                      Connection to Project Issues
1.     The need for the proposed Project.
3.     The potential commercial impacts of the proposed Project.
4.     The potential environmental and socio-economic effects of the proposed project, including any
       cumulative environmental effects that are likely to result from the project, including those required to
       be considered by the NEB’s Filing Manual
8.     Potential impacts of the project on Aboriginal interests
10. Contingency planning for spills, accidents or malfunctions, during construction and operation of the
       project.
1. Safety – we have Elders, Youth and small children, and potentially grandchildren coming. Unless there was
a flawless safety record on any pipeline, and there is no 100% guarantee for water, livelihood continuance or
continuity, then, for this reason alone, I am opposed.
2. Economics – the straight route down the west side of RR5.1 is the simplest, straight, and
therefore must be the most economic which all fall within the Louis Bull Tribe's traditional territory and to
date, there has been NO SOCIO-ECONOMIC Benefit tabled, discussed, mitigated or anticipated, to NO
RESOLVE then has Louis Bull Tribe benefited, will benefit moving forward, as such, Louis Bull Tribe opposes
the project
3. A similar number of homesites/home quarters would be impacted by routing straight south on the west
side of RR5.1..
4. Safety - The route straight down the west side of RR5.1 would impact the least amount of “developed”
land…therefore impacting the most“undeveloped” land, yet there is not mention to have Louis Bull Tribe as
part of any procurement, contracting or environmental monitoring, ground truthing or Emergency response
Planning exercises - have been held, nor discussed or mentioned to date - Opposition of the project then is
determined.
5. Aboriginal interest - the following is a description of how many groups and how many people Louis Bull
Tribe proposed to engage and/or coordinate.
I am engaging the Louis Bull Tribe and their Peoples hereto as listed:
  Omaciniwahk Society – Hunter’s Society
  Fishing Society
  Medicine & Ceremonialist Users & Monitors
  Woman’s Society
  Youth Council
  Elder’s Senate
  Community or Tribal Peoples Reporting
That are concerned about potential, ongoing and cumulative and short, medium and long term residual
impacts to the Louis Bull Tribe, Peoples and Traditional Territory.

Tourmaline Oil Corp. (“Tourmaline”) is a major Canadian gas producer, focused on long-term growth through
an aggressive exploration, development and production program in North East British Columbia as well as the
Alberta Deep Basin. Tourmaline is one of a number of companies who contracted with NOVA Gas
Transmission Ltd. (“NGTL”) at the Alberta/B.C. export delivery point for service to commence in alignment
with the construction schedule, which had reflected Q2 2018 completion. Tourmaline contracted the largest
export volume, totalling approximately to 200 mcf/d by November 2018. In connection with this service, we
contracted additional transportation service on Foothills Pipe Line and the Gas Transmission Northwest
system. Tourmaline has also pursued commercial and transportation arrangements downstream with the
anticipated start date of April 1, 2018; as such, Tourmaline strongly supports the application of the Sundre
Crossover Project (“Project”) and respectively notes that time is of the essence in this proceeding.

NuVista Energy Ltd. (NuVista) is an oil and natural gas company actively engaged in the exploration for, and
the development and production of, oil and natural gas reserves in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin.
 Our primary focus is on the scalable and repeatable condensate-rich Montney formation in the Alberta Deep
Basin (Wapiti Montney).
NuVista has made upstream commitments to advance NuVista’s growth plans and has made a concerted
effort to diversify its sales portfolio. NuVista holds contracts that underpin the Sundre Crossover Project and
this is an important part of our growth and diversification plan. This project is crucial to enable NuVista and
other WCSB producers to export additional gas to the Malin gas hub and into California which is a key market
for Canadian gas. NuVista is in full support of Nova Gas Transmission Ltd’s application.
It was anticipated that the project would complete construction in the first quarter of 2018. That is
important as it is the beginning of the summer season for natural gas markets. AECO gas prices have been
exceptionally weak this summer and with additional supply growth in the WCSB the outlook for gas prices
next summer are even more dire. It is critically important for NuVista and the rest of the gas industry to have
additional outlets and markets for our gas and as soon as possible. Accordingly NuVista supports a review
that is done as expeditiously as possible.

Dear Ms. Young: '
RE: NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL) Application for the Sundre Crossover Project ‘

Hearing Order GH-002-2017 ‘
Tourmaline Oil Corp. (”Tourmaline") is one of the largest gas producers in Canada and focuses on
long-term growth through an aggressive exploration, development and production program in the
Alberta Deep Basin as well as North East British Columbia. The Sundre Crossover Project
(”Project”) will be a valuable resource to Canada and the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin
(”WCSB”) with the proposed egress and market access. Tourmaline fully supports NGTL’s Sundre l
Crossover application. ‘
As a producer, Tourmaline is of the view that the Project is beneficial for the entire Western
Canadian Natural Gas industry as it provides an optimal solution to improve Canada’s
competitiveness by moving Western Canadian supply to the markets in Oregon and ‘
California. This Project allows our growing supply to access the liquid California market which will
improve supply/demand fundamentals for all producers in the WCSB. This is a key factor to
preventing gas from being trapped both physically and economically in Western Canada.
Tourmaline believes that without sufficient access to export markets, investment levels by all
producers in the WCSB are at risk. Western Canada currently has more natural gas supply than
access to markets which has deteriorated prices in the recent months. This pricing strain will
continue to erode the value ofthe WCSB unless we can improve critical market access to liquid
markets, such as California. This has serious consequences for not only producers, but for the
businesses and communities in Alberta as well. Decreased production levels and depressed prices
influences the long-term business plans of producers which, in turn, effects investment in the

WCSB, royalties collected by the Province of Alberta, and has a compound effect on the residents
in Alberta communities and the businesses which serve the producers.
Tourmaline feels this Project would address an existing bottleneck in NGTL’s export abilities, which
once corrected would aid the development of both existing and new production areas in the ‘
WCSB, improve operational flexibility for producers, provide access to long—term Western US
markets, and increase the overall liquidity within North American markets. And that the timing of
this project is vital to the sustainability and continued growth of the Alberta Basin.
In addition to market impact, this Project also greatly impacts Tourmaline’s business plans.
Tourmaline contracted with NGTL at the A|berta/B.C. export delivery point for service to
commence in alignment with the construction schedule, which had reflected C12 2018 completion.
In connection with this service, Tourmaline contracted additional transportation service on
Foothills Pipe Line and the Gas Transmission Northwest system. Tourmaline also pursued
commercial and transportation arrangements downstream with the anticipated start date of April
1, 2018. Tourmaline feels it is vital that this Project application is approved in a timely manner so
that the new service implementation can coincide with the start of the summer gas season in the
' California markets. This is a critical time for both consumers of natural gas and producers since it *-
- is a key demand period of the year. Any delay in NOVA’s Project would prevent Tourmaline from l
being able to successfully take its gas to market.
Tourmaline strongly encourages the Board to approve the Project application, as filed, in an
expeditious manner such that the service can be implemented for April 1, 2018.
Sincerely,
4 ..

Dear Ms. Young,
Re : NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL) Application for the Sundre Crossover Project
Hearing Order GH-002-2017
ARC Resources Ltd. (ARC) is an exploration and production company with operations
focused primarily in the Montney regions of Northeast British Columbia and Northwest
Alberta. The Sundre Crossover Project (Project) is necessary to ensuring natural gas
egress beyond the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB). ARC fully supports the
Sundre Crossover Project and the timelines put forward by NGTL.
The Montney formation is one of the largest and most prolific areas in North America.
Export pipelines and egress out of the Montney region and beyond the WCSB would
ensure that Canadian assets remain competitive across North America, as the U.S gas
supply continues to grow, and preserve our market share.
ARC has an abundance of proven natural gas reserves in the Montney and the Project is
critical infrastructure that would support our long term plans. Currently, the limited
egress out of the Montney and the larger WCSB has placed significant downward
pressure on price which impacts ARC’s long-term investment decisions, volume planning
and our continued growth. Further, the downward pressure on price challenges the
health and longevity of our industry, the economies of both Alberta and British
Columbia, specifically, and Canada, generally.
In addition to the above, ARC entered into contracts that underpin the Project as well as
downstream transportation contracts that would deliver ARC gas to the Pacific North-
West aligning with the timelines proposed by NGTL. Approval of the Project would align
ARC’s contractual commitments, critical to ensuring our gas reaches the market and
further still, the proposed April 2018 start date for the Project, would ensure increased
export capacity to a market that typically has a higher demand for gas during the
summer months.
ARC takes a risk managed approach to its’ development with a view to the long-term.
ARC is and will continue to be a long-term producer in the Montney region and we are
in full support of the Sundre Crossover Project, as filed. We hereby respectfully ask that
 the Board strive to approve the Project, as filed, such that service can be implemented
by April 1, 2018.
Yours truly,
ARC RESOURCES LTD.

supports the NGTL Sundre Cressever preject and is eeneerned abeut a delay te an April 1,
2018 in-serviee date.
Frem a eemmersial prospective this prejeet is an impertant expansien ef the NGTL system. The
Sundre Crossing presides timely and eeenemie pipeline capacity te dewnstream markets that
are currently eenstrained. The preject was fully subscribed by shippers in the recent Open
Seasen and witheut this expansien natural gas that is currently curtailed en the NGTL system
cannot reach these dewnstream expert markets. Eneana’s upstream reseuree development is
dependent an access ta downstream markets, Ensana suggests that lack ef predictable market
access decreases the competitiveness of the W033 as a supply source and negatively;F impacts
royalty revenues sellected.
Eneana has entered inte additional dewnstream transpartatien ebligatiens to align with the
eemmitments made an the Sundre Cressever prejeet. Any delays tn the pretest, beyond April 1,

Dear Ms. Young:
RE: Sundre Crossover Project —- Response to NEB Ruling N o. 2 Decision
Hearing Order GH—002-2017
Tourmaline Oil Corp. (“Tourmaline”) is in receipt of the Board’s letter dated October 24, 2017, with respect to 1
a comment process regarding the correctness of its Decision on Ruling No. 2, issued October 19, 2017 (the ‘
“Decision”). While Tourmaline respects that the invitation for comments was directed to NGTL and other
Intervenors, due to the signiﬁcance of the Sundre Crossover Project Hearing (the “Hearing”) to its business
and the WCSB as a whole, Tourmaline Wishes to reiterate its support for the Hearing and the current timelines.
Tourmaline is of the opinion that the Board carefully measured all relevant factors When considering its
Decision and fully supports that Decision. Tourmaline does not believe that a reasonable doubt was offered as 1
to the correctness of the decision to not allow an extension to the timeline for the Hearing by Mr. Grace or Mr.
’ Greer. Tourmaline feels that the Board clearly outlined its Views in the Decision and the considerations and
credence given to the concerns raised regarding timing and the hearing process.
Tourmaline believes that the requested delay of this Hearing would adversely impact all producers in the ,
WCSB and the already weakened gas prices. April 1St is signiﬁcant in timing as it coincides with the decrease I
in Alberta’s winter demand and the increase demand in the Paciﬁc Northwest and California markets. It is w
Vital that the Hearing proceed as scheduled to insure that the new service implementation can coincide With
this critical time for both consumers of natural gas and producers alike. In NGTL’s October 18, 2017 response
to IR No. 5, NGTL submitted that construction would need to commence no later than December 11, 2017, in
order to meet the contracted in-service date of April 1, 2018.
Tourmaline strongly encourages the Board not to vary the Decision and to continue With the deadlines as
currently set out such that the service can be implemented for April 1, 2018.
Singerely,

Dear Ms. Young:
RE: Sundre Crossover Project - Response to NEB Ruling No. 2 Decision
Hearing Order GH-002-2017
Dear Ms. Young,
NuVista Energy Ltd (NuVista) filed a letter of comment on October 17, 2017 in support of the Sundre
Crossover Project and the importance of an April 1, 2018 start date for this project. NuVista provided a
letter of comment rather than participating as an intervenor, however given the importance of this project
we feel compelled to comment on the Board’s Decision on Ruling No. 2 and request that the Board will
take into consideration our comments.
We agree with the Board’s decision and we do not believe that there has been doubt raised as to the
correctness of the Board’s Decision. The Board has had a vigorous and well publicized process which
can be defended and respected worldwide. Participants have been aware of this project for over a year
and this regulatory proceeding for over eight months, we feel this is fair and due process.
NuVista is one of the parties that have contracted for this capacity underpinning these facilities. We have
also entered into downstream transportation contracts that align with the April 1, 2018 commitments we
have made on this project.
An expedient decision is important to us and we respect and agree with the Board’s Decision on Ruling
No. 2. Thank you for considering our concerns.
Yours Truly,
Kevin Asman

Dear Ms. Young,
Re : Sundre Crossover (NEB File OF-Fac—Gas—N081-2017-04 01) (the "Project") and Hearing
Order GH-002-2017 — Applications to Review the Decision on Ruling No. 2 (the “Decision"),
Dismissing Motions to Change the Hearing Process and Hearing Dates (the "Applications to
Review")
ARC Resources Ltd. ("ARC") is an exploration and production company with operations focused
primarily in the Montney regions of Northeast British Columbia and Northwest Alberta. ARC
takes a risk-managed approach to its development with a view to the long-term. ARC is
providing this letter in response to the letter from the National Energy Board (the "Board")
dated October 24, 2017. We acknowledge NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. and other intervenors
were invited to respond, nevertheless, as a Commenter, ARC would like to provide comment
given the importance of both the Project and the planned April 1, 2018 in-service date.
in issuing the Decision, the Board considered the submissions made by all parties and decided
to dismiss the motions, finding that "the schedule achieves both efﬁciency and fairness to all
parties". We have reviewed the Applications to Review and with all due respect, the
Applications to Review do not demonstrate any errors, changed circumstances or new facts
that would raise doubt as to the correctness of the Board's Decision. As such, ARC respectfully
submits that the Board should uphold its Decision and dismiss the Applications to Review in
order to maintain the November 1, 2017 oral hearing date, which is critical to the planned April
1, 2018 in-service date for the Project.
Should you have any questions of relating to our comments, please do not hesitate to contact
the undersigned. We thank the Board for the opportunity to provide these comments.
Yours truly,
ARC RESOURCES LTD.
