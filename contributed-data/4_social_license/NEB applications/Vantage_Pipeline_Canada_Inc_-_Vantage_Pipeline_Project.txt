Please send me the document on the Vantage Pipeline Canada Inc. — Vantage Pipeline Proj ect. You
would save yourself a lot of problems by stating WHERE the proposal is to take place and giving the
public a free long distance phone number.
This is unacceptable to waste our time and our money by making yourself difﬁcult to reach. I must say
sadly that this unfriendly to the public way of doing things is typical of NEB.

Hello,
Transport Canada (TC) has reviewed the s.52 National Energy Board (NEB) Application and Environmental and Socio-
Economic Assessment (ESA) for the above-noted project, submitted February 2011, for triggers which would engage TC
as a responsibility authority to a federal environmental assessment. This is further to the additional information request
sent to you via email on March 15, 2011 by the Major Projects Management Office (MPMO) on behalf of TC.
Based on the ESA and information from the Navigable Waters Protection Program (NWPP):
     •   There are 175 potential watercourse crossings associated with this project. Of these:
             o   75 have no visible channel;
             o   78 are undefined drainages;
             o   17 have been verified through application to the NWPP that the Navigable Waters Protection Act
                 (NWPA) does not apply (Sites #2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18, 14a, 15, 16, 36, 22, 23, and 24),
                       1 of which may potentially be avoided if the pipeline is rerouted (Site #14a), and
                       1 of which was evaluated using 2008 fieldwork data (Site #3);
             o   4 are unknown water types, and application to the NWPP has not been made (Sites #10, 17, 33, and 34);
                 and
             o   1 is a large permanent watercourse that may potentially be avoided if the pipeline is rerouted, and
                 application to the NWPP has not been made (Site #32).
     •   There will be surface water intakes associated with this project for the purpose of hydrostatic testing for the
         pipeline once construction is completed.
Please respond to the following questions to myself, copying the MPMO and NWPP, and filing an official response
with the NEB:
     1. Is the above-listed information correct and up-to-date?
     2. When will Vantage submit applications to the NWPP for the following remaining potential pipeline crossings,
         based on fieldwork projected to take place in spring 2011?
             •   Site #3, Piapot Creek (Note: NWPP determined the NWPA does not apply based on 2008 fieldwork)
             •   Site #10, Jones Creek
                                                              1
                  •    Site #17, Unnamed Tributary to Notukeu Creek
                 •    Site #33, Reserve Creek
                 •    Site #34, Unnamed Tributary to Payne Lake
                 •    Site #32, Overland Lake
     3. When will Vantage know the final routing for the pipeline with regards to the proposed watercourse crossings at
           Sites #14a and 32?
     4. When will Vantage submit applications to the NWPP for all proposed surface water intakes?
     5. Are there are any other new works or undertakings proposed to take place in, on, over, under, through or across
           any navigable water or any existing works that were not previously authorized under the Navigable Waters
           Protection Act (NWPA) to be modified on a watercourse or water body, other than the 175 pipeline crossings
           and surface water intakes for hydrostatic testing listed above?
I am available to discuss at (204) 983-8807 prior to the submission of an official reply.
Thanks!

Dear Ms. Erickson:
Re: Vantage Pipeline Project
Hearing Order OH-03-2011
File Of-Fac-Oil—V040-2010-01 02 '
Comments on Draft Scope of the Environmental Assessment
We are writing to provide comments on the Draft Scope of the Environmental Assessment
(“Draft Scope of BA”) for the Vantage Pipeline Project on behalf of Poundmaker Cree Nation
#114, Lucky Man Cree Nation, Mosquito, Grizzly Bear’s Head, Lean Man First Nation, and
Little Pine F irst Nation. We can also advise that we have been retained to represent Wood
Mountain F irst Nation, and File Hills Qu’Appell Tribal Council in the OH-O3-2011 proceeding.
These six F irst Nation groups are referred to herein collectively as “the Nations”.
In general, and subject to the following comments, the Nations agree with the Draft Scope of
EA. However, the Nations also wish to clarify and conﬁrm their understanding and expectations
of the factors outlined in the Draft Scope of EA, namely:
1. That the mitigation of environmental effects must also include consideration of any
accommodation owed by the Crown to Aboriginal groups; and
2. That consideration of cultural heritage, historical resources, and Aboriginal land use
includes consideration of potential impacts on reserve lands, treaty land entitlement
lands, Aboriginal title, and potential or established Aboriginal and treaty rights.
We ask that the Board please advise if the Nation’s understanding of the issues covered by the
Draft Scope of EA is inaccurate.
We further submit that the draft scope of EA should speciﬁcally include a requirement that
consultation with affected First Nations take place to identify impacts (including cumulative
effects) and appropriate mitigation with respect to traditional harvesting and ceremonial uses

Dear Bruce Standingready:
Further to our previous correspondence of November 30, 2010, the purpose of this letter
is to provide you with additional information on the process for Crown consultation with
Aboriginal groups during the regulatory process for Vantage Pipeline Canada lnc.’s
(Vantage) proposed Vantage Pipeline Project (the Project).
The federal regulatory review process for the Project is being managed through the
Government’s Major Projects Management Office (MPMO) Initiative. The Project is
subject to a screening-level environmental assessment (EA) under the Canadian
Environmental Assessment Act (CEA Act) and a public hearing under the National
Energy Board Act.
The Crown will rely on the National Energy Board (NEB) hearing process, to the extent
possible, to fulfill the Crown's duty to consult Aboriginal groups. Using the NEB hearing
process, the following general steps are being followed by the Crown to identify,
consider and address the potential adverse impacts of the proposed project on
established or potential Aboriginal or treaty rights:
1) As part of its enhanced Aboriginal engagement process initiated after
receiving the Project Description, the NEB contacted potentially affected
Aboriginal groups by letter and by telephone to provide an overview of the
regulatory process and offer to meet to discuss both the federal review process
for the proposed project, and the various ways to participate in the NEB hearing
process. You will recall that the NEB contacted you by letter dated November 5,
2010 in this regard.
2) Following receipt of the Project Application from Vantage the NEB issued a
Hearing Order on April 4, 2011 for the project review, which provided infomiation
about the public hearing process, including options for those wishing to
participate. Through the public hearing process, the NEB, in accordance with its
obligations under the National Energy Board Act and the CEA Act, will consider
project-related concerns raised by Aboriginal groups.

(Vantage) proposed Vantage Pipeline Project (the Project).
The federal regulatory review process for the Project is being managed through the
Government’s Major Projects Management Office (MPMO) Initiative. The Project is
subject to a screening-level environmental assessment (EA) under the Canadian
Environmental Assessment Act (CEA Act) and a public hearing under the National
Energy Board Act.
The Crown will rely on the National Energy Board (NEB) hearing process, to the extent
possible, to fulfill the Crown’s duty to consult Aboriginal groups. Using the NEB hearing
process, the following general steps are being followed by the Crown to identify,
consider and address the potential adverse impacts of the proposed project on
established or potential Aboriginal or treaty rights:
1) As part of its enhanced Aboriginal engagement process initiated after
receiving the Project Description, the NEB contacted potentially affected
Aboriginal groups by letter and by telephone to provide an overview of the
regulatory process and offer to meet to discuss both the federal review process
for the proposed project, and the various ways to participate in the NEB hearing
process. You will recall that the NEB contacted you by letter dated November 5,
2010 in this regard.
2) Following receipt of the Project Application from Vantage the NEB issued a
Hearing Order on April 4. 2011 for the project review, which provided information
about the public hearing process, including options for those wishing to
participate. Through the public hearing process, the NEB, in accordance with its
obligations under the National Energy Board Act and the CEA Act, will consider
project-related concerns raised by Aboriginal groups.

3) Aboriginal groups that have project-related concerns that have not already
been resolved with Vantage are encouraged to convey these concerns to the
NEB, either orally or in writing, through the NEB public hearing process. Please
refer to the NEB Hearing Order for a description of participation options. Please
note that certain participation options have a deadline. To access the Hearing
Order and the electronic repository, go to the NEB's website www.neb-one.gc.ca,
click on Regulatory Documents “View" on the right-hand side of the screen, then
“Quick Links” and select Vantage Pipeline Canada Inc. — Application for Vantage
Pipeline Project (OH-3-2011) from the list.
4) Transport Canada is also engaged as a federal regulatory authority for the
proposed project. Transport Canada is participating in the NEB process to further
understand the concerns that Aboriginal groups may have regarding the possible
effects of its federal regulatory decisions on potential or established Aboriginal or
treaty rights. Federal authorizations for the proposed project will only be issued
once the Crown determines that the consultation obligations associated with the
authorization in question have been discharged. Attached you will find
information about Transport Canada's mandate and responsibilities, including
relevant contact information. I would encourage you to contact these
representatives if you would like to schedule a meeting to learn more about
Transport Canada’s decision-making responsibilities and the Crown’s
participation in the NEB process.

If you wish to obtain more information regarding the MPMO Initiative in general or on the

overall Crown approach to exercising the duty to consult for NEB projects subject to the

MPMO process, please refer to the MPMO’s website at www.mgmo.gc.ca or contact

Dear Alfred Manyheads:
Further to our previous correspondence of November 30, 2010, the purpose of this letter
is to provide you with additional information on the process for Crown consultation with
Aboriginal groups during the regulatory process for Vantage Pipeline Canada lnc.’s
(Vantage) proposed Vantage Pipeline Project (the Project).
The federal regulatory review process for the Project is being managed through the
Government's Major Projects Management Office (MPMO) Initiative. The Project is
subject to a screening—level environmental assessment (EA) under the Canadian
Environmental Assessment Act (CEA Act) and a public hearing under the National
Energy Board Act.
The Crown will rely on the National Energy Board (NEB) hearing process, to the extent
possible, to fulfill the Crown‘s duty to consult Aboriginal groups. Using the NEB hearing
process, the following general steps are being followed by the Crown to identify,
consider and address the potential adverse impacts of the proposed project on
established or potential Aboriginal or treaty rights:
1) As part of its enhanced Aboriginal engagement process initiated after
receiving the Project Description, the NEB contacted potentially affected
Aboriginal groups by letter and by telephone to provide an overview of the
regulatory process and offer to meet to discuss both the federal review process
for the proposed project, and the various ways to participate in the NEB hearing
process. You will recall that the NEB contacted you by letter dated November 5,
2010 in this regard.
2) Following receipt of the Project Application from Vantage the NEB issued a
Hearing Order on April 4, 2011 for the project review, which provided information
about the public hearing process, including options for those wishing to
participate. Through the public hearing process, the NEB, in accordance with its
obligations under the National Energy Board Act and the CEA Act, will consider
project-related concerns raised by Aboriginal groups.

3) Aboriginal groups that have project-related concerns that have not already
been resolved with Vantage are encouraged to convey these concerns to the
NEB, either orally or in writing, through the NEB public hearing process. Please
refer to the NEB Hearing Order for a description of participation options. Please
note that certain participation options have a deadline. To access the Hearing
Order and the electronic repository, go to the NEB's website www.neb-one.gc.ca,
click on Regulatory Documents “View" on the right-hand side of the screen. then
“Quick Links” and select Vantage Pipeline Canada Inc. — Application for Vantage
Pipeline Project (OH-3-2011) from the list.
4) Transport Canada is also engaged as a federal regulatory authority for the
proposed project. Transport Canada is participating in the NEB process to further
understand the concerns that Aboriginal groups may have regarding the possible
effects of its federal regulatory decisions on potential or established Aboriginal or
treaty rights. Federal authorizations for the proposed project will only be issued
once the Crown determines that the consultation obligations associated with the
authorization in question have been discharged. Attached you will ﬁnd
information about Transport Canada's mandate and responsibilities, including
relevant contact information. I would encourage you to contact these
representatives if you would like to schedule a meeting to learn more about
Transport Canada‘s decision-making responsibilities and the Crown’s
participation in the NEB process.

If you wish to obtain more information regarding the MPMO Initiative in general or on the

overall Crown approach to exercising the duty to consult for NEB projects subject to the

Dear Beverly Bellegarde:

Further to our previous correspondence of November 30, 2010, the purpose of this letter

is to provide you with additional infomation on the process for Crown consultation with

Aboriginal groups during the regulatory process for Vantage Pipeline Canada lnc.’s

(Vantage) proposed Vantage Pipeline Project (the Project).

The federal regulatory review process for the Project is being managed through the

Government’s Major Projects Management Ofﬁce (MPMO) Initiative. The Project is

subject to a screening-Ievel environmental assessment (EA) under the Canadian

Environmental Assessment Act (CEA Act) and a public hearing under the National

Energy Board Act.

The Crown will rely on the National Energy Board (NEB) hearing process, to the extent

possible, to fulfill the Crown’s duty to consult Aboriginal groups. Using the NEB hearing

process, the following general steps are being followed by the Crown to identify,

consider and address the potential adverse impacts of the proposed project on

established or potential Aboriginal or treaty rights:
1) As part of its enhanced Aboriginal engagement process initiated after
receiving the Project Description, the NEB contacted potentially affected
Aboriginal groups by letter and by telephone to provide an overview of the
regulatory process and offer to meet to discuss both the federal review process
for the proposed project, and the various ways to participate in the NEB hearing
process. You will recall that the NEB contacted you by letter dated November 5.
2010 in this regard.
2) Following receipt of the Project Application from Vantage the NEB issued a
Hearing Order on April 4, 2011 for the project review, which provided information
about the public hearing process, including options for those wishing to
participate. Through the public hearing process, the NEB, in accordance with its
obligations under the National Energy Board Act and the CEA Act, will consider
project-related concerns raised by Aboriginal groups.

Canada

- 2 -

3) Aboriginal groups that have project—related concerns that have not already
been resolved with Vantage are encouraged to convey these concerns to the
NEB. either orally or in writing. through the NEB public hearing process. Please
refer to the NEB Hearing Order for a description of participation options. Please
note that certain participation options have a deadline. To access the Hearing
Order and the electronic repository, go to the NEB's website www.neb-one.gc.oa,
click on Regulatory Documents “View” on the right-hand side of the screen, then
“Quick Links" and select Vantage Pipeline Canada Inc. — Application for Vantage
Pipeline Project (OH-3-2011) from the list.
4) Transport Canada is also engaged as a federal regulatory authority for the
proposed project. Transport Canada is participating in the NEB process to further
understand the concerns that Aboriginal groups may have regarding the possible
effects of its federal regulatory decisions on potential or established Aboriginal or
treaty rights. Federal authorizations for the proposed project will only be issued
once the Crown determines that the consultation obligations associated with the
authorization in question have been discharged. Attached you will find
information about Transport Canada's mandate and responsibilities, including
relevant contact information. I would encourage you to contact these
representatives if you would like to schedule a meeting to learn more about
Transport Canada’s decision-making responsibilities and the Crown’s
participation in the NEB process.

If you wish to obtain more information regarding the MPMO Initiative in general or on the

overall Crown approach to exercising the duty to consult for NEB projects subject to the

MPMO process. please refer to the MPMO’s website at www.mgmogoca or contact

Scott Clausen at 613‘995-7506 or sclausen@nrcan.gc.ca. Should you have any

questions related to the NEB hearing process, please contact Lisa Hunter at 403-299-

Dear Pauline Okemow:
Further to our previous correspondence of November 30, 2010, the purpose of this letter
is to provide you with additional information on the process for Crown consultation with
Aboriginal groups during the regulatory process for Vantage Pipeline Canada lnc.’s
(Vantage) proposed Vantage Pipeline Project (the Project).
The federal regulatory review process for the Project is being managed through the
Government's Major Projects Management Ofﬁce (MPMO) Initiative. The Project is
subject to a screening-level environmental assessment (EA) under the Canadian
Environmental Assessment Act (CEA Act) and a public hearing under the National
Energy Board Act.
The Crown will rely on the National Energy Board (NEB) hearing process, to the extent
possible, to fulfill the Crown‘s duty to consult Aboriginal groups. Using the NEB hearing
process, the following general steps are being followed by the Crown to identify,
consider and address the potential adverse impacts of the proposed project on
established or potential Aboriginal or treaty rights:
1) As part of its enhanced Aboriginal engagement process initiated after
receiving the Project Description, the NEB contacted potentially affected
Aboriginal groups by letter and by telephone to provide an overview of the
regulatory process and offer to meet to discuss both the federal review process
for the proposed project, and the various ways to participate in the NEB hearing
process. You will recall that the NEB contacted you by letter dated November 5,
2010 in this regard.
2) Following receipt of the Project Application from Vantage the NEB issued a
Hearing Order on April 4, 2011 for the project review, which provided information
about the public hearing process, including options for those wishing to
participate. Through the public hearing process, the NEB, in accordance with its
obligations under the National Energy Board Act and the CEA Act, will consider
project-related concerns raised by Aboriginal groups.

possible. to fulfill the Crown's duty to consult Aboriginal groups. Using the NEB hearing
process, the following general steps are being followed by the Crown to identify,
consider and address the potential adverse impacts of the proposed project on
established or potential Aboriginal or treaty rights:
1) As part of its enhanced Aboriginal engagement process initiated after
receiving the Project Description, the NEB contacted potentially affected
Aboriginal groups by letter and by telephone to provide an overview of the
regulatory process and offer to meet to discuss both the federal review process
for the proposed project, and the various ways to participate in the NEB hearing
process. You will recall that the NEB contacted you by letter dated November 5.
2010 in this regard.
2) Following receipt of the Project Application from Vantage the NEB issued a
Hearing Order on April 4, 2011 for the project review, which provided information
about the public hearing process, including options for those wishing to
participate. Through the public hearing process. the NEB, in accordance with its
obligations under the National Energy Board Act and the CEA Act, will consider
project-related concerns raised by Aboriginal groups.

3) Aboriginal groups that have project-related concerns that have not already
been resolved with Vantage are encouraged to convey these concerns to the
NEB, either orally or in writing, through the NEB public hearing process. Please
refer to the NEB Hearing Order for a description of participation options. Please
note that certain participation options have a deadline. To access the Hearing
Order and the electronic repository, go to the NEB's website www.neb-one.gc.ca,
click on Regulatory Documents “View" on the right-hand side of the screen, then
“Quick Links” and select Vantage Pipeline Canada Inc. — Application for Vantage
Pipeline Project (OH-3-2011) from the list.
4) Transport Canada is also engaged as a federal regulatory authority for the
proposed project. Transport Canada is participating in the NEB process to further
understand the concerns that Aboriginal groups may have regarding the possible
effects of its federal regulatory decisions on potential or established Aboriginal or
treaty rights. Federal authorizations for the proposed project will only be issued
once the Crown determines that the consultation obligations associated with the
authorization in question have been discharged. Attached you will ﬁnd
information about Transport Canada's mandate and responsibilities, including
relevant contact information. I would encourage you to contact these
representatives if you would like to schedule a meeting to learn more about
Transport Canada’s decision-making responsibilities and the Crown's
participation in the NEB process.

If you wish to obtain more information regarding the MPMO Initiative in general or on the

overall Crown approach to exercising the duty to consult for NEB projects subject to the

MPMO process, please refer to the MPMO's website at www.mgmo.gc.ca or contact

Scott Clausen at 613-995-7506 or sclausen@nrcan.gc.ca. Should you have any

questions related to the NEB hearing process. please contact Lisa Hunter at 403-299-

      1. INTRODUCTION
Environmental assessment guidelines exist for a variety of wildlife, particularly for species of concern in
Prairie Canada. Current guidelines include species of national, provincial and local concern. For each
species of sensitive wildlife, guidelines identify restrictions on passive and development activities for
industry and other wildlife disturbances. Guidelines typically include setback distances from nests or dens
and timing to avoid disturbances.
The guidelines herein are primarily directed towards wildlife species at risk that are currently afforded
protection under the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) in areas of federal jurisdiction in Alberta,
Saskatchewan and Manitoba. For migratory birds, this includes any areas in Canada where they may
occur. For other wildlife species, these guidelines are primarily directed towards federal lands, including
but not limited to, Agriculture and Agri-food Canada (formerly PFRA) community pastures, Department
of National Defense training areas, Indian Reserve Lands, and Federally protected areas. Provincial
legislation may extend this protection to provincial and private lands. Although these guidelines are
primarily intended for areas of federal jurisdiction they are applicable in a broader context.
     2. BACKGROUND
In 2000, Environment Canada contracted Avocet Environmental Inc., which produced a working
document entitled Development of Standardized Guidelines for Petroleum Industry Activities that Affect
COSEWIC (Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada) Prairie and Northern Region
Vertebrate Species at Risk (COSEWIC Guidelines) (Scobie and Faminow 2000). The information for the
COSEWIC Guidelines was based on broad consultation, the best available knowledge and existing local
management. It reflected the varying degrees of impact that activities associated with the petroleum
industry may have on these COSEWIC species.
Avocet Environmental Inc. was again contracted in 2006 to provide Environment Canada with an update
to the COSEWIC Guidelines, but this time with a focus on Prairie and Northern Region Vertebrate
Species Listed under the Species at Risk Act in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. It included: a
compilation of the current state of species knowledge; expert opinion as it related to the guidelines;
identification of beneficial management practices for each species; and a contact list of experts consulted.
Environment Canada adapted information from both contracts and augmented the literature review and
expert consultations through 2009 with the intent to produce a standardized set of guidelines for areas of
federal jurisdiction across the species range in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba that would be
defensible to industry.
The development of standardized guidelines for setback distances, timing restrictions, and mitigation
strategies is the continuation of a process that must be updated to reflect changes in development
practices, species knowledge, existing published research and literature. This is an ongoing process of
development, adjustment, and modification as required by new information.
These updated guidelines are not intended to address setbacks or timing restrictions for “critical habitat”,
as these definitions currently do not exist for most vertebrate SARA listed species. These updated
guidelines should be used in conjunction with the “residence” descriptions available on the SARA Public
Registry website.
     3. METHODS
Through the provisions of the contracts, a comprehensive search for literature on this topic was
undertaken by searching online databases at the University of Alberta library. The scope of this literature
review was limited to direct visual, auditory or kinetic (e.g., seismic) disturbances and their effects on
                                                   Page 3
                                                                                           Updated: March 2010
 stationary structures/habitats that relate to important aspects of a species life history (i.e., hibernacula,
natal den, nest, breeding pond, migratory staging area). Limitations and assumptions of the review are
further discussed within the methodology. Environment Canada augmented this review with a web based
search for existing and newly published literature.
Species authorities representing both federal and provincial governments and non-government personnel
from the Prairie and Northern Region of Canada were involved in the expert consultation process.
Participants were asked to review and provide comment on critical dates and suggested rationale for
setbacks from the original document (Scobie and Faminow 2000) in light of recent available knowledge
and their own experiences. The results of the literature review and information on petroleum industry
activities were provided to these individuals to aid in this assessment. Input was also requested on
beneficial management practices and any other relevant literature, which had not been included in the
literature review.
The combined results of the literature review and expert consultation resulted in a revised setback
distance and critical timing for petroleum industry activities for each species assessed. Such criteria were
derived for various levels of disturbance for each species. Matrix values for the level of disturbance of
petroleum industry activities that had been developed within the original document (Scobie and Faminow
2000) were reworked and simplified to produce a table of Activities and Associated Level of Disturbance
(Table 1). This table was based on the type, magnitude and risk of disturbance due to particular
petroleum industry activities and a category between low and high level of disturbance. The reader is
referred to the species specific setback distances and critical times (Table 2) to derive the recommended
setback or timing information for that level of disturbance.
The setbacks and critical timing are based on a scenario where the area is deemed “undisturbed” where no
previous development or other mitigative circumstances exist in the area. Existing mitigative
circumstances (i.e., existing land use, aboveground structures, topography) should be assessed on a case-
by-case basis in consultation with the proper authority to determine whether the setback or timing can be
relaxed. If an assessment by a qualified professional wildlife biologist is not undertaken, it is suggested
that the original setbacks apply.
Beneficial management practices, in terms of timing, setbacks and habitat conservation, were summarized
both in general terms and on a per species basis.
3.1. Setback Assessment System
In 2000, representatives from the petroleum industry were consulted in an effort to develop a set of matrix
values that would reflect the range of activities that could impact species (Scobie and Faminow 2000). To
simplify the current document the matrix was reworked into an Activities and Associated Level of
Disturbance Table (Table 1). The Type, Magnitude and Risk associated with a disturbance were utilized
to arrive at a “LEVEL” of disturbance (e.g., high, medium, low). This “LEVEL” of disturbance was then
utilized to determine the appropriate setback and timing criteria for each species in the assessment (Table
2).
This approach is based on the premise that not all developments are the same in terms of magnitude and
risk and thus should warrant different setback distances and timing restrictions. This process is applied
equally to all species included in the evaluation, regardless of level of designation.

  ”Associated activities/infrastructure” refers to the additional well site disturbances that generally accompany drilling and are
collectively considered part of the well drilling process. This includes: perforating, fracturing, swabbing, dewatering, finishing,
flowline construction, cattle guard construction, fencing, tie-ins, trail construction, installation of tanks, sheds, etc.)
Participants were asked to provide comment on the LOW, MEDIUM and HIGH categories. The
MEDIUM-LOW and MEDIUM-HIGH categories were added to offer more flexibility to the Table.
It was emphasized to industry that for many of the species being considered there was a general lack of
science to back up the setback distances and that the biological information would be based on a broad
consultation process and for many species, anecdotal evidence.
3.2. Literature Review
Scope of the Literature Review
Through the provisions of the contracts an extensive literature search relating to the effects of petroleum
development on SARA listed vertebrate species in the Prairie and Northern Region was conducted by
searching online databases at the University of Alberta library. Few studies have been performed on this
specific topic therefore the search was expanded to find articles relating to the effect of human
disturbance on the reproductive success or fitness of individual vertebrate SARA species. The review
focused on the effects on stationary structures/habitats that relate to important aspects of a species life
history (i.e., hibernacula, natal den, nest, breeding pond, migratory staging area). The scope of this
literature search was limited to direct visual, auditory or kinetic (e.g., seismic) disturbances.
Parallel levels of disturbance can be found between petroleum and non-petroleum related activities (e.g.,
recreational use of off-road vehicles = surveyor use of off-road vehicles). In addition, many of the studies
on the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on wildlife have used humans walking towards nest sites as
the means of disturbance (this type of disturbance would be considered “LOW level”, as noted in Table
1). In instances where there was difficulty in locating articles on a particular species, articles on closely
                                                                Page 5
                                                                                                                   Updated: March 2010
 related species with similar reproductive history and habitat preferences were substituted. Only peer
reviewed articles and grey literature specifically oriented towards the topic were chosen.
Literature Review Methodology
The methodology used was based on that used by Jalkotzy et al. (1997). Search platforms, databases and
the range of years searched can be found in Appendix A. Some databases were updated weekly and all
searches were completed by December 2006 for the purposes of the contract. (Because more literature on
this subject has since become available, Environment Canada continued internet searches and species
expert consultations through 2009.)
A Boolean search was performed in each database combining the terms from group 1 and 2
(Appendix A). The list of journals from each database was compared and databases deemed redundant by
overlap were not searched. For most databases a search was performed for each species by combining the
species name (past and present) in all its forms (common and Latin) with all the terms in group 2
(Appendix A). Some databases had few articles on target species, thus only one or a combination of all of
the forms of the species name required searching.
For species with little available literature (e.g., long-billed curlew), the genus name was included in the
search (e.g., “long-billed curlew” or “Numenius americanus” or Numenius), in hope of increasing the
results. Other species with more literature written and with more species in the same genus had their
search confined to their common name and complete Latin name (e.g., “ferruginous hawk” or “Buteo
regalis”). Wildcards (e.g., *) and truncation symbols were used in searches where possible to include
singular, plural and other forms of the terms (e.g., disturb* = disturb, disturbance, disturbs, disturbances,
disturbing, disturbed).
The results of these database searches were exported to the online reference managing program
RefWorks. The large number of references resulting from these searches were further searched and sorted
in RefWorks, according to the relevancy of the topic. Relevant articles that could not be obtained from
online journals, by Internet search or found at the University of Alberta library, were ordered through the
interlibrary loan system. Once obtained, all articles were read and included in this report if deemed
relevant to the updated guidelines. The Literature Cited section of each applicable article was thoroughly
examined for additional references.
3.3. Consultation with Recovery Team Experts and Species Authorities
Recovery Team experts included both federal and provincial representatives. Species-authorities included
government and non-government personnel from the Prairie and Northern Region of Canada. They were
provided, by email correspondence, with a Portable Document Format (PDF) version of a Power Point
presentation summarizing petroleum development activities, the results of the Literature Review and the
2000 COSEWIC Guidelines Timing and Setback table. They were asked to consider the animal living in
relative isolation from human disturbance when commenting on updating the critical dates, suggested
setbacks, rationale for setbacks, best management practices and any other literature not included in the
literature review. No emphasis was given to the SARA designation. This process was applied equally to all
species included in the evaluation, regardless of level of SARA designation. Species authorities were
asked to make recommendations based on the spirit of the prohibitions defined in SARA, especially with
respect to the damage or destruction of the residence.
The critical dates, suggested setbacks, and rationale for the setback distances were compiled and sent out
to the original interviewees as well as to a broader range of species-authorities for final comment.
In discussions with both environmental and industry representatives, it was stressed that this is meant to
be a work in progress and that the final document will not be static. The process must be continually
updated to reflect changes in development practices and species knowledge. Some species already have
existing local management groups and, therefore guidelines were not developed for the woodland caribou
and grizzly bear.

 3.4. Assumptions in Development/Revision of Setbacks
Based upon the literature review, the distance at which the animal fled or behaviour changed (e.g.,
alertness, distraction displays) was considered the distance at which the animal was disturbed. The change
in behaviour or movement of the individual was deemed to have an adverse effect on reproductive
success and the fitness of individuals. There are several factors that could alter the reaction of a species to
a disturbance. These factors include habituation, stage of reproduction and intensity of disturbance (low,
medium and high). As the updated guidelines are meant to be used prior to new development, it is
assumed that the animals will not be habituated and the level of disturbance has already been factored in.
It is acknowledged that there are different reactions to disturbances between species and between
individuals within a species. For other species, especially those that have large foraging areas or
movements, the setbacks were set according to the mortality risk associated with the activity (e.g.
amphibians and roads).
     4. RESULTS
The results of the literature review, on a per species basis, are provided in Sections 6 through 9 of this
report and are grouped by avifauna (birds), mammals, reptiles and amphibians. The Beneficial
Management Practices are located immediately following the Literature Review and reflect much of the
information found in the Literature Review.
During the Recovery Team Expert and Species Authorities consultation process, a total of 140 species-
authorities in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and various locations in the United
States were contacted. (NOTE: some people have experience with more than one species).
Table 2 contains the compiled listing of Setback Distances, Critical Timing and Rationale that apply to
nests and dens, unless otherwise noted. This listing is organized into species groups of avifauna (birds),
mammals, reptiles and amphibians.
     5. DISCUSSION
The development of standardized guidelines for setback distances, timing restrictions, and mitigation
strategies is the continuation of a process that began in Saskatchewan in 1994 and must be updated to
reflect changes in development practices, species knowledge, existing research and literature.
As industry practices evolve, adjustments to these guidelines will need to be made. When planning a
project, initially the proponent should attempt to schedule the project to have the least impact on
species at risk. For most species this means construction outside of the breeding season. If avoiding this
critical period is not an option, then the guidelines should be applied for planning and operational
purposes.
If a company must develop within the critical times, historic species information is available from
provincial databases (i.e., Conservation Data Centers [CDC]) that highlight historic “hot spots”. If the
CDC data is limited for a given area, then it should be determined if the development activity is within the
range of a listed species and whether there is suitable habitat present. The onus would then be on the
developer to hire qualified wildlife personnel to conduct surveys for all listed species whose ranges occur
within the project area to identify current locations of nests or dens. If a den or nest is found within the
recommended setback distance, and setback distances cannot be met, existing land use/aboveground
                                                   Page 7
                                                                                             Updated: March 2010
 structures and topography in the area should be evaluated to determine if the setback can be relaxed. This
would be done in consultation with the proper regulating authority.
Industry activity values are based on perceived impacts and will be revised as more knowledge is gained.
There was some debate regarding the low weighting given to the Pipeline type of disturbance on Table 1.
The concern with the low weighting was that pipeline rights-of-way frequently become trails and then
roads. Should a pipeline right-of-way become a trail or road, then setback distances would increase
to reflect the increased level of disturbance, in this instance for example, that of an Access Road.
This principle should apply to any disturbance activity.
Similarly, should multiple activities occur at a location, for example, the construction of a number of
wells or a number of roads, then it may be necessary to increase setbacks to reflect a higher level of
disturbance. Disturbance tolerances may vary among individuals and among species, though once
exceeded, may lead to future habitat avoidance.
Monitoring and follow-up is an important consideration when undertaking activities during the breeding
season and when applying setbacks. Insight into the effectiveness of applied timing restrictions and
setbacks in avoiding impacts to species at risk can be used to refine practices to minimize effects to
species at risk. Monitoring can also provide insight into species threshold level responses to
fragmentation types of disturbances.
Listed below are comments that appeared numerous times as suggested Beneficial Management
Practices that may benefit species and make projects more cost effective. To reduce duplication they
have only been appended below and should be considered for each species.
    Developments should occur outside of the breeding season.
    Hire qualified and trained wildlife personnel to conduct pre-development inventories.
    Consider additive or cumulative effects and/or develop threshold limits.
    Create, implement and enforce a traffic control program, as appropriate.
    Once critical habitat is defined, incorporate into setbacks.
    If working within recommended setback distances, conduct a two year post-construction monitoring
     project in consultation with the appropriate regulatory authority.
    If seeding is required, use native seed common to the area (local provenance).
    Favor multi-pad sites over single well locations.
    Use trails; if ruts get too deep, fill with gravel rather than building a gravel road.
    Maintain noise emissions at less than 49 dBA. Or 10 dBA above ambient in remote areas.
It must be emphasized that species are at risk in Canada for a variety of reasons. The majority of these
species rely upon native prairie for a significant portion of their breeding cycle. Though the impact of
industrial development on these species cannot be dismissed, it is only one factor at work. Agriculture,
urban development, and other types of fragmentation and degradation of habitat, along with natural
cycles, must be included in discussions of species recovery efforts.
It is critical that qualified environmental/wildlife professionals are engaged when setting appropriate
setback distances. These updated guidelines provide suggestions based on knowledge gained to date. It
may be possible to relax the recommended setbacks, should mitigative circumstances be identified (in the
opinion of a qualified professional in consultation with regulators). It is also noteworthy, for some
species, that the close proximity of existing disturbances should not be used as a reason to automatically
relax setbacks, as the effects can be additive (e.g. Sage Grouse). If a project is planned without a

 qualified wildlife biologist review, then the maximum setback distances should be applied at all
times.
It is recommended that industry consider the cumulative effects of all projects that involve infilling of
existing resource developments. Agencies are encouraged to develop multi-disciplinary studies to
investigate effectiveness of setback distances and timing restrictions. Applied research should focus on
determining the impacts of development activities on species and their habitats. There is a need to
identify disturbance density effects and thresholds for populations.
Knowledge Gaps
The following are knowledge gaps identified from the literature review:
    Information on the overwintering sites of herptiles and the potential effects of exposing these sites
     during ground disturbance in winter.
    Effects of human disturbance on reproductive success of individual denning mammals and many bird
     species.
    Distances of roads from reptile hibernacula that result in lower mortality.
    Effects of petroleum specific disturbances (e.g., seismic testing, trails, pipeline construction, etc.) on
     reproductive success of species at risk.
    Effects of habitat fragmentation on species at risk.
    Effects of disturbances on species time budgets and individual fitness of species at risk.
    Success or failure of setback distances, timing restrictions and mitigation.
    Effect of seismic activity on Ord’s kangaroo rat.
    Effect of noise (e.g., traffic, compressor stations, etc.) on density and reproductive success of
     breeding birds.
    Edge effect on nest predation and nest parasitism.

      6. LITERATURE REVIEW - BIRDS
Avifauna in the prairie portion of the Prairie and Northern Region are more susceptible to disturbance due
to the lack of topographical relief and vegetation to conceal nests from anthropomorphic disturbances.
The distance at which a nesting bird flushes from a disturbance can be used as a rough measure for
establishing setback distances. The literature suggests that an additional 40 m (Rodgers and Smith 1995)
or 50 m (Vos et al. 1985) be added to the flush distance because the bird was aware of the disturbance and
stressed before it flushed.
Disturbances may affect the reproductive success of a nesting bird in the following ways:
    the nest is open to predation when an incubating adult is flushed;
    the disturbance may attract predators via the bird distraction display;
    a predator may be attracted to the scent of feces deposited by a fleeing bird;
    exposure of the eggs or nestlings to the elements when the bird is flushed;
    nest abandonment;
    eggs broken or nestlings accidentally kicked out of the nest by a fleeing bird; or
    young may try to fledge prematurely and are then open to predation.
It is important to note the negative effect of noise from human disturbances on bird occurrence and
density. Noise is thought to be the most important reason for the reduction in songbird density near roads
(Reijnen et al. 1995, Reijnen et al. 1996). A reduction in density of all birds combined occurred at a
threshold of 47 dBA (Reijnen et al. 1996). Sixty percent of the species studied showed a reduction in
density, but the distance to which bird density was reduced from roads varied with bird species and
amount of traffic (Reijnen et al. 1995). Roads with light traffic, namely less than 12 vehicles per day,
have also shown effects for grassland birds within 100m (Ingelfinger and Anderson 2004), although
habitat fragmentation due to the roads was suggested as a possible cofactor. It is important to recognize
the need for species-specific studies, as there exists this variability in responses by different species of
birds to different levels of noise. In addition, an important trend to notice for some species is that as
traffic increases the distance effect on bird presence and breeding increases (Forman et al. 2002). In a
study in the Netherlands, approximately 60% of the grassland bird species were reduced by 12-56%
within 100 m of roads with traffic of 5,000 cars a day, and the average disturbance distance for birds with
reduced densities from traffic noise was 120 m (Reijnen et al. 1996). A study on the effect of compressor
station noise in the boreal forest found that all passerines combined had a 37% reduction in density near
compressor stations (Habib 2006). This effect of reduced density extended out to at least 250 m from the
compressor stations (Habib 2006). Estimated noise levels for shallow gas fracturing operations,
traditional drill rig operations and typical coil rig operations on grasslands at 250m distances have been
estimated at 57 dBA, 55 dBA and 55 dBA, respectively (EnCana 2007). At 500m these were attenuated
to 49 dBA, 44 dBA and 44 dBA, respectively. A threshold of 49 dBA was proposed for grassland birds
and grouse (Ingelfinger 2001; Nicholoff 2003; Wyoming Game and Fish Dept. 2009) which was deemed
an acceptable 10 dBA above natural background noises.
There are however, some species such as the horned lark that increase near roads (Inglefinger 2001,
Ingelfinger and Anderson 2004). The Tennessee and yellow warbler seem attracted to compressor stations
(Habib 2006) and others, such as the Lapland longspur, seem not to be affected by roads (Male and Nol
2005). Waterfowl are also known to nest in roadside ditches. For birds that nest in noisy areas, there also
exists a cost of increased energy expenditure, as it was found that birds may increase their vocal
amplitude (Brumm 2004) or frequency (Habib 2006) when singing in noisy environments.
The following cases of direct mortality of birds from petroleum development should not be ignored. In
the United States, from 1992 to 2005, the bird remains from petroleum waste fluids stored in exposed pits

Alberta Fish and Wildlife Division (2001) and Saskatchewan Environment (2003) recommend buffers
between disturbances and burrowing owl nest burrows (Table 3). On repeated approaches to burrowing
owl nests, Fisher et al. (2004) found that on average, the observer was allowed to approach within 69 m
of the nest burrow prior to the eggs hatching, 50 m in the first week after hatch and 49 m in third week
after hatch, before an adult flushed. The California Burrowing Owl Consortium (1997) recommends a
50 m buffer from disturbances for occupied burrowing owl burrows outside the breeding season
(September 1 to January 31) and 75 m during the breeding season (February 1 to August 31). Year-round
it is also suggested that a 100 m foraging radius (2.63 ha) be maintained around burrows of burrowing
owls (or single resident owl) (California Burrowing Owl Consortium 1997). Anecdotally, Lehman et al.
(1999) documented the failure of a nest that was within 100 m of a tank maneuver area while other
burrowing owl pairs nested successfully at 600 m and further from tank ranges.

Deschant et al 2003 provides a summary of the extensive literature on disturbance effects on ferruginous
hawks, a number of which are referred to in the discussion below. Alberta Fish and Wildlife Division
(2001) and Saskatchewan Environment (2003) recommend buffers between disturbances and ferruginous
hawk nests (Table 4). Wyoming Game and Fish Department (2004) suggests reducing noise levels to
49 dBA or less at the nest sites of at risk raptor species to minimize the effects of continuous noise on
raptors that are sensitive to human disturbance during the breeding season. The maximum distance at
which wintering ferruginous hawks flushed in response to humans walking and driving a vehicle were
165 m and 280 m respectively (Knight et al. 1993). The maximum and average flush distances of nesting
ferruginous hawks to a human intruder on foot was found to be 500 m and 100 m respectively (Hansen
1994). After observing the post-fledging behaviour of ferruginous hawks, Konrad and Gilmer (1986)
recommended delaying any energy development near active nests until 45 days after fledging to avoid
disrupting post-fledging activities.
While studying ferruginous hawks in Montana, Ensign (1983) observed incubating hawks crouch in the
nest when he approached to about 450 m on foot. Ensign (1983) noted incubating ferruginous hawks
flushed from the nest when an intruder on foot, on a motorcycle and in a truck was within 170 m, 95 m
and 75 - 200 m, respectively. No apparent adverse reactions were observed from incubating adults when a
helicopter approached as close as 30 m from the nest (Ensign 1983). Ensign (1983) recommends that
human activities within 450 m of active ferruginous hawk nests should be restricted as that is the distance
at which hawks first elicited a response to nest approaches. Both Keeley (2009) and Holmes (1994)
observed a mean flushing distance of 380m for ferruginous hawks and recommended a 640m buffer
during the nestling phase. Olendorff (1993) suggested buffer zones of 0.25 km for brief disturbances, 0.5
km for intermittent activities, 0.8 km for prolonged activities, and ≥1.0 km for construction or similar
activities.
A study on the ferruginous hawk in South Dakota found that fewer nests were successful when located
closer to human activity (Blair 1978). There was an 11.4% greater probability of fledging from a nest that
was far from occupied dwellings than a nest that was near occupied dwellings (Blair 1978). Hanson
(1994) suggested that the cause of failure for seven ferruginous hawk nests was an increase in human
disturbance during the nest initiation and incubation period. Hansen (1994) recommends a 500 m buffer
around nest sites, as that was the minimum distance observed for a successful nest from a disturbance.
A study designed to simulate the effects of low-level human activity on nesting ferruginous hawks found
that the disturbed nests fledged less than half the number of young compared to undisturbed nests (White
and Thurow 1985). The furthest distance an incubating hawk flushed when approached on foot was
400 m, and 500 m when approached by vehicle (White and Thurow 1985). White and Thurow (1985)
suggest a buffer of 250 m for low-level human activities during incubation, as 90% of adults did not flush
when human activity was confined to distances of 250 m or more. Keeley (2009) noted that an abundance
of prey species may contribute to hawks being in better physiological condition and better able to cope

 with stress due to disturbance, whereas in areas (or years) of low prey abundance, hawks may be in poor
physiological condition and more susceptible to disturbance.
In a two year study on the reproductive and behavioural responses of ferruginous hawks to human
activity, the reproductive success of ferruginous hawks in areas disturbed by petroleum development was
lower than in the reference area, though not significantly (P=0.17) (Van Horn 1993). During the study, he
determined that ferruginous hawks flushed 95% of the time when a human intruder approached to within
532 m, and recommend a buffer zone of 500 m as sufficient for preventing the induction of most nest
defence behaviour. In a study by White and Thurow (1985) only 52% of the territories that contained
human disturbed nests were occupied the following year, compared to 93% of territories containing
control nests. Van Horn (1993) noticed that 75% of ferruginous hawks choose nest sites that were greater
than 1.9 km from active oil wells and, as a result, suggested that oilfield expansion be limited to areas
greater than 1.9 km from known nesting sites. Smith et al (2007) found that ferruginous hawk nest use
and activity was greater in areas with reduced oil and gas development within an 800m radius. In North
Dakota, Ferruginous Hawks avoided cropland and nesting within 0.7 km of occupied buildings (Gaines
1985). In Alberta, Ferruginous Hawks rarely nested within 0.5 km of farmyards (Schmutz 1984). Gilmer
and Stewart (1983) found that pairs nesting within 500 m of interstates or well-traveled roads acclimated
to activity on the roads and exhibited similar rates of nest success to other pairs. Nesting has also been
observed near active railroads and gravel roads (Gilmer and Stewart 1983, MacLaren et al. 1988).
A combined buffer zone was recommended by Suter and Joness (1981) for Golden Eagle, Ferruginous
Hawk and Prairie falcon, on the basis of a survey of raptor field researchers. To avoid thermal stress to
eggs or young, they proposed that disturbances by a few individuals performing tasks such as geological,
biological or soil surveys should be kept a minimum of 500 m from active nests or limited to short
periods and during times of moderate temperature (Suter and Joness 1981). During periods of
construction and other extended noisy activities, they recommended a buffer of 1 km from active nest
sites to avoid nest abandonment (Suter and Joness 1981). Literature cited in the Suter and Joness (1981)
article was weighted towards golden eagles. Suter and Joness (1981) also suggested that longer distances
would reduce visibility and hence persecution from shooting.
Anecdotally, Lehman et al. (1999) noted a ferruginous hawk nest failure that was within 1,000 m of a
tank range during military training activities. Eggs were observed before the training activities began and
one dead nestling was in the nest when the activities were completed (Lehman et al. 1999). Several
studies have attributed nest abandonment to the sensitivity of ferruginous hawks to disturbance and
observer intrusion at the nest site during incubation (Fitzner et al. 1977, Ensign 1983, Gilmer and Stewart
1983).

 If working within recommended setback distances, conduct a two year post-construction monitoring
  project in consultation with the appropriate regulatory authority.
 No activity for 45 days after young have hatched.
 Keep oil and gas developments 500m from important prey concentrations.
 Protect nesting trees from cattle rubbing.

Anecdotally, it was observed over a 2-month period during the summer, that 12 and 4 least bitterns had
been killed by highway traffic and by a fence, respectively, both adjacent to a wetland (Guillory 1973).
The author suggested that the limited binocular vision and a habit of flying low and slowly over marsh
vegetation made this species susceptible to these types of mortality (Guillory 1973).

Beneficial Management Practices
   Prevent loss, drainage, channelization and degradation of wetlands (e.g. pollution and siltation
    runoff).
   Maintain a minimum 100 m buffer from wetlands especially for larger freshwater wetlands (greater
    than 5 hectares) that are dominated by dense tall emergent vegetation, typically cattail (Typha spp.),
    and containing deeper open water areas.
   Avoid activities in areas while birds are present, approximately May 1 to July 31.
   Create, implement and enforce a traffic control program with maximum 50 km/hr speed zones day
    and night within 100 m of wetlands with least bitterns.
   Avoid installing new fences in vicinity of wetlands.

The recommended distances in Saskatchewan between human disturbances and nest sites of loggerhead
shrikes, from May 1 to August 15, are 50 m, 250 m and 400 m for low, medium and high levels of
disturbance, respectively (Saskatchewan Environment 2003). Alberta Sustainable Resource Development
(2002) states that “To preserve existing breeding sites, land within 400 m of an active nest should be
restored to the natural grassland/shrubland habitat upon which these birds rely. Furthermore, although
shrikes are tolerant of some human activity, human disturbance within 100 m of a nest should be
minimized during the mid-May to mid-August breeding season.” In a study by Collister and Wilson
(2007) researchers were able to approach within 50-100m of nests to observe birds without altering
behaviour, but recommended a 250m buffer around nests to minimize the potential for territory
abandonment. The Wyoming Game and Fish Department (2004) suggest, from April 1 through June 30,
that noise levels be reduced to 49 dBA or less within the breeding habitat of listed songbird species to
minimize the effects of continuous noise on species that rely upon aural cues for successful breeding.

Beneficial Management Practices
 Avoid activities in areas while birds are present, approximately May 1 to August 15.
   Do not cut or disturb trees and shrubs.
   Minimize disturbance of native grassland within 400m of nests. Avoid fragmentation of habitat

   Implement a traffic control program within 300 m of nest sites.
   Restore marginal agricultural land to native grassland.
   Avoid spraying of habitat with pesticides.

  Moderate grazing is beneficial. Patches of both short and tall grass is ideal with an average height of
  at least 15- to 20-cm. Heavy grazing can be detrimental.
 Scattered woody and dense vegetation along fence-lines and shelterbelts and in pastures and riparian
  areas (potential nesting substrate and foraging areas) should be conserved and protected from rubbing
  and trampling by cattle.
 Maintain noise emissions at less than 49 dBA. Or 10 dBA above ambient in remote areas.

Alberta Fish and Wildlife Division (2001) and Saskatchewan Environment (2003) recommend buffers
between development and long-billed curlew nests (Table 5). Several studies showed that incubating
long-billed curlews often do not flush from the nest until approached closer than 2 m (Wolfe 1931,
Sugden 1933, Graul 1971, Allen 1980), but also note that the distraction displays by both adults is quite
aggressive (Wolfe 1931, Sugden 1933, Graul 1971, Allen 1980). An energy expenditure as expensive as
that of the long-billed curlew’s distraction display may have an effect on individual fitness. Sadler and
Maher (1976) reported the nest failure of a long billed curlew soon after the hatch of the first egg, and
attributed the abandonment to the presence of a fencing crew near the nest.

Beneficial Management Practices
 Avoid activities in areas while birds are present, approximately May 1 to August 15.
    Include fall sewn crops and irrigated hay land in search areas.
    If birds are exhibiting territorial displays, consider there is a nest nearby and apply setbacks;
     searching for a nest site may cause nest failure.
    Create, implement and enforce a traffic control program with maximum 50 km/hr speed zones (day
     only) within 400 m of nest sites.

Wyoming Game and Fish Department (2004) suggest that from April 1 to June 30 noise levels be reduced
to 49 dBA or less within the breeding habitat of listed songbird species to minimize the effects of
continuous noise on species that rely on aural cues for successful breeding. In several studies it was
observed that incubating female McCown’s longspurs often did not flush until the observer was very
close to the nest (DuBois 1937, Mickey 1943) but one sensitive female left the nest whenever the
observer came closer than 10 feet (Mickey 1943). Mickey (1943) thought that the adults from one nest
prematurely ejected their nestlings out of the nest because they were disturbed by his daily visits. An
observation of foraging individuals found that some McCown’s longspurs flushed when the observer was
as far as 25 m while most others flew when the observer was 5 to 10 m away (With 1994). One study
found that a significant portion of pre-natal mortality was desertion of eggs and it was thought that regular
daily visits and intensive observer activity around the nest may have contributed to this egg desertion
(Felske 1971). Territory size is approximately one hectare (With 1994).

During the nesting period (May 1 to July 31), Saskatchewan Environment (2003) recommends a buffer of
200 m, 400 m and 500 m between mountain plover nests and low, medium and high levels of human
disturbance, respectively. While studying the breeding biology of the mountain plover, Graul (1975)
observed that the incubating adult will frequently quietly leave the nest while the intruder is still
50-100 m away, but occasionally will not flush until the intruder is near the nest. The effect of foot traffic
on another upland nesting plover, the Eurasian golden plover (Pluvialis apricaria), showed that when
people stayed on the designated trail, plovers avoided areas within 50 m of the trail during the chick-
rearing period (Finney et al. 2005).

Alberta Fish and Wildlife Division (2001) and Saskatchewan Environment (2003) recommend buffers
between development and peregrine falcon nests (Table 6). Erickson (1988) recommends where possible,
a 1,000 m no-disturbance area around peregrine falcon nest sites from April 15 to September 1. While
studying the impacts of nature tourism on peregrine falcons, Kurvits (1989) noted that incubating falcons
became agitated when approached on foot and recommends a buffer zone of 200 m for one person
visiting two times a week on foot. Windsor (1977) tested the response of peregrine falcons to aircraft
overpasses and hikers. He observed that the incubating falcons first exhibited stressful behaviour when
the hiker was as far as 1,500 m away. Windsor (1977) recommends that hiking trails be kept at least
1,500 m from a peregrine falcon nest if visible from the trail, and no closer than 800 m if not visible.
During a study on the response of nesting peregrine falcons to various stimuli, Johnson (1988) observed
that thresholds of 3,200 m, 1,600 m, 800 m and 500 m existed before the incubating falcon responded.
Johnson (1988) recommended the following management areas at various levels of topographical
screening (Table 7). Human activities in the core area will likely have an adverse effect on falcons and
activities in the review area should be examined by a qualified biologist to assess the possibility of
disturbance and the need for mitigation (Johnson 1988).

Wyoming Game and Fish Department (2004) suggests reducing noise levels to 49 dBA or less at the nest
sites of at risk raptor species to minimize the effects of continuous noise on raptors that are sensitive to
human disturbance during the breeding season. Anecdotally, Bond (1946) observed that at least three nest
sites were abandoned after roads were built below them and Hickey (1942) noted that frequent or

 prolonged visits by humans to the top of an escarpment or cut-bank may bring about interruptions in the
breeding cycle, and in some cases desertion of the nest.

Alberta Fish and Wildlife Division (2001) and Saskatchewan Environment (2003) recommend buffers
between development and the high water mark of piping plover breeding water bodies (Table 8). When
approached by a human on foot, piping plovers have been observed flushing from the nest at 20-30 m
(Burger 1987) and flushing from the nest or brood at distances as far as 210 m (Flemming et al. 1988).
Flemming (1988) also noted that chick behaviour appeared unchanged until approaching humans were
approximately 160 m from chicks and adult behaviour was not altered by vehicles. Goldin (1993)
observed that adult and juvenile piping plovers did not flush until pedestrians, joggers and off-road
vehicles were within 18.7 m, 19.5 m and 20.4 m on average, respectively. The average flush distance of
chicks in the Goldin (1993) study was found to be 20.7 m, 32.3 m and 19.3 m from pedestrians, joggers
and off-road vehicles, respectively. Several studies showed that human disturbances did negatively affect
piping plovers, as reproductive success was suppressed in areas with higher levels of disturbance (Cairns
1982, Flemming et al. 1988, Strauss 1990). Human disturbance decreased the amount of time piping
plovers spent foraging and increased the amount of time they spent reacting to disturbances (Burger 1991,
Goldin 1993, Goldin and Regosin 1998) and may have had a negative effect on chick survival and adult
maintenance (Burger 1991). More specifically, Burger (1994) found that the amount of time spent
foraging decreased as the number of people within 100 m increased. Strauss (1990) also found that
plovers spent less time feeding when pedestrians and moving vehicles were less than 100 m than when
undisturbed.

Saskatchewan Environment (2003) recommends a buffer between human disturbance and a red-headed
woodpecker nest of 100 m from medium and high levels of disturbance during the breeding season
(April 15 to June 30). No buffer was recommended for low levels of disturbance. Jackson (1976) noted
the red-headed woodpecker’s sensitivity to disturbance as he observed an incubating male red-headed

Alberta Fish and Wildlife Division (2001) recommends buffers between development and sage grouse
leks, and Saskatchewan Environment (2003) recommends buffers between leks and nest sites (Table 9). It
is thought that sage grouse avoid areas within 0.8 km of power lines because raptors use power lines as
perches (Alberta Sage Grouse Recovery Action Group 2005). Wyoming Game and Fish Department
(2004) suggests avoidance of surface disturbing activities within 400 m of the perimeter of occupied sage
grouse leks (occupied is defined as active at least one breeding season in the last ten years). It is also
recommended that human and vehicular activity be avoided from 8pm to 8am from March 1 to May 15
within 400 m of the perimeter of occupied sage grouse leks (Wyoming Game and Fish Department 2004).
Also during these dates, it is advised that no anthropogenic sources of noise should exceed 10 dBA above
natural ambient noise measured at the perimeter of any occupied lek at any time of the day (Wyoming
Game and Fish Department 2004), and no noise should reach a lek one hour before sunrise and two hours
after sunrise.
Holloran (2005) looked at the response of sage grouse populations to natural gas field development in
Wyoming and found that sage grouse were sensitive to industrial disturbances. The number of males
attending leks declined relative to controls within 3 km of producing wells and main haul roads, and
appeared to decline within 5 km of drilling rigs (Holloran 2005). As traffic increased, male attendance on
leks decreased, and this effect was intensified when traffic increased within 1.3 km of leks during
strutting periods (Holloran 2005). Increased noise intensity was attributed as the primary cause of
declined male lek attendance near main haul roads and drilling rigs (Holloran 2005). Well densities
exceeding one well per 283 ha within 3 km of leks, negatively influenced male lek attendance, and rates
of decline increased as leks became surrounded by the developing gas field (i.e., producing wells in three
directions of lek) (Holloran 2005). Nesting females avoided areas of high well densities and successful
nests were in areas of lower well densities, compared to unsuccessful nests (Holloran 2005). Based on the
results of his study, Holloran (2005) recommends the following to reduce the negative impact of gas field
development on sage grouse:
    Maintain well density of less than or equal to one well per 283 ha (approx. one well/section) within
     3 km of leks.
    Sound-muffling of noisy gas field structures within 5 km of leks.
    Reduce overall traffic volumes (i.e., car pooling) and isolate traffic disturbances (i.e., use one main
     road to and from the gas field).
    Enforce daily traffic timing restrictions (i.e., avoid strutting periods).

     Protect an area of at least 5 km from development that contains the breeding habitat shrub
     requirements outlined in the sage grouse habitat management guidelines (Connelly et al. 2000).
Observations on the impacts of gas development on sage grouse nest initiation and movement revealed
that hens from disturbed leks had lower nest initiation and nested approximately twice as far from the leks
they were captured on than did hens from undisturbed leks (Lyon 2000, Lyon and Anderson 2003). The
type of disturbance in this study was a main haul road with 1-12 vehicles per day of traffic that was near
three leks where all males from these three disturbed leks danced on or within 15 m of the road (Lyon and
Anderson 2003). The disturbance affected the grouse, despite the imposition of restrictions on activities
between 12am and 9am during the breeding season.
Based on their findings, Holloran and Anderson (2005) recommended a buffer of 5 km from sage grouse
leks in contiguous sagebrush habitats and the minimization or halting of activities that negatively affect
sage grouse nesting habitat within 5 km of leks. They also recommend that all potential nesting areas be
protected regardless of their proximity to leks (Holloran and Anderson 2005).
Aldridge (2005) noted that sage grouse chick failure increased and broods avoided areas with a greater
density of visible well sites within 1 km. Lek male attendance and lek persistence decreased within 3.2
km of coal-bed natural gas development in Montana and Wyoming (Walker et al 2007). Connelly et al.
(2000) recommended that energy-related facilities be greater than 3.2 km from active leks whenever
possible, and human activities in sight of or within 500 m of a lek be minimized during the early morning
and late evening when grouse are on or around the leks. Anecdotal observations in Alberta by Aldridge
(1998), noted that four of six leks that had been disturbed by oil and gas activity were no longer active.
Also in Alberta, the development of roads and wells within approximately 200 m of three different sage
grouse leks between 1983 and 1985 coincided with the abandonment of these leks (Braun et al. 2002).
Aldridge (2007) suggested that nest and brood source habitats may be on average 6 to 10 km from leks.
A study on the effects of various disturbances at the lek of a similar species (sharp-tailed grouse) found
that females were affected in some way by all disturbances and it is suggested that reproduction of grouse
at those leks did not occur (Baydack and Hein 1987).

Beneficial Management Practices
 Route and place development and disturbances away from suitable nesting habitat (e.g., tall grass,
   ephemeral edges).
  No activity within recommended setback distances from leks between one hour before sunrise until
   two hours after sunrise.
  Create, implement and enforce a traffic control program with maximum 50 km/hr speed zones day
   and night within 5 km of leks.
  Delay mowing (rights-of-way, lease sites, etc.) until after July 31.
  Complete a cumulative effects assessment if well density exceeds more than one well per 283 ha
   (approx. one well/section) within 3 km of a lek.
  Reduce traffic volumes.
  Maintain noise emissions at less than 10 dBA within 5 km of a lek.
  If working within recommended setback distances, conduct a two year post-construction monitoring
   project in consultation with the appropriate regulatory authority.
  Favor multi-pad sites over single well locations.
  Once cumulative effects modeling is complete, incorporate into all development activities.

In the boreal forest the rusty blackbird favours wetlands such as slow-moving streams, peat bogs,
marshes, swamps, beaver ponds and pasture edges. Home ranges averaged 15.2ha and 71.1ha,
respectively, for solitary and semi colonial birds (Powell et al (in prep.). Tassone (1981) noted
that a number of species of birds that have strong affinities for riparian buffer strips will not
inhabit strips narrower than 50 m. In the Canadian boreal forest, Darveau et al. (1995) compared
bird abundance and species composition in riparian forest strips of varying widths and found that
riparian strips of at least 60 m were needed to support forest dwelling birds including riparian
species. Powell et al (in prep.) recommended that foresters maintain at least a 75 m buffer
around wetlands suitable for or occupied by rusty blackbirds to minimize rusty blackbird nesting
in or near regenerating clear cuts, which are susceptible to higher predation. To reduce edge
effect predation on nests in natural habitats, Powell (2008) recommended that forest practitioners
maintain a minimum 100m buffer from wetlands.

Alberta Fish and Wildlife Division (2001) and Saskatchewan Environment (2003) recommend buffers
between development and sage thrasher nests (Table 10). Wyoming Game and Fish Department (2004)
suggest that from April 1 to June 30, noise levels be reduced to 49 dBA or less within the breeding habitat
of listed songbird species to minimize the effects of continuous noise on species that rely on aural cues for
successful breeding. Several studies have shown that the density of sagebrush obligate passerines (sage
sparrows, brewers sparrows and sage thrashers) decline within 100 m of roads used for natural gas
extraction, with the passage of as few as 12 vehicles per day (Inglefinger 2001, Ingelfinger and Anderson
2004).

Alberta Fish and Wildlife Division (2001) and Saskatchewan Environment (2003) recommend buffers
between development and short-eared owl nests (Table 11). Incubating female short-eared owls have been
observed to flush from a human intruder when they were about to be stepped on (Urner 1923, Urner 1925,
Clark 1975), when 2 m away (Lewis 1925), up to 7.5 m away (Kitchin 1919), and for a particularly
sensitive individual when the intruders were as far as 10 m away (Leasure and Holt 1991). In a project to
capture and band short-eared owls it was possible for two individuals to approach on opposite sides of 20
incubating female owls on nests to a distance of 6 m without the female flushing (Leasure and Holt 1991).
Holt (1992) suggests that disturbance during nest construction may affect nest site selection, as three out
of four females that were flushed from nest scrapes, before eggs were laid, moved to new locations
nearby to nest.

Alberta Fish and Wildlife Division (2001) and Saskatchewan Environment (2003) recommend buffers
between development and Sprague’s pipit nests (Table 12). Wyoming Game and Fish Department (2004)
suggest that from April 1 to June 30, noise levels be reduced to 49 dBA or less within the breeding habitat
of listed songbird species to minimize the effects of continuous noise on species that rely on aural cues for
successful breeding.
Linnen 2006 and 2008 found reduced bird densities up to a minimum of 300 m from wells or associated
trails/ roads. The response was similar for both shallow gas and oil activities. Because winter
construction of roads, trails and wells does not mitigate for this effect, consideration should be given to
year round setbacks in high quality habitat.

Beneficial Management Practices
 Avoid activities in areas while birds are present, approximately May 1 to August 31.
    Nests are difficult to find, therefore if male birds are heard singing within 100 m consider there is a
     nest and apply setbacks. Searching for nest site may cause nest failure.
    Route and place disturbances away from suitable nesting habitat (e.g., grass of moderate height,
     mixed grass prairie with good litter cover, ephemeral edges). Consider year round setbacks in habitat
     that consistently provides high quality nesting cover.
    Delay mowing (rights-of-way, lease sites, etc.).

Due to the existing protection of the Whooping crane nesting areas in Wood Buffalo National Park,
literature concerning the effects of disturbance on the staging areas of the Whooping crane is the focus of
the literature review for this species.
The type of disturbance and distance from cranes was found to be more important than frequency of
disturbance in eliciting a response from whooping cranes on their wintering grounds (Lewis and Slack
1992). When a disturbance, such as helicopters, airboats and tour boats was less than 1,000 m away,
whooping cranes reacted most strongly and flushing rates were 50%, 38% and 24%, respectively (Lewis
and Slack 1992). A study on the flushing distance of wintering whooping cranes in Texas found the
maximum flushing distances to be 275 m, 550 m and 1,100 m from airboats, airboats with a hunter and
power boats with a hunter, respectively (Mabie et al. 1989). Burger and Gochfeld (2001) investigated the
reactions of sandhill cranes to a vehicle stopped perpendicular to feeding flocks, at an important crane
staging area near the Nebraska Platte River. Many cranes within 300 m of the vehicle flew or walked
away while few cranes beyond 300 m flew but several stopped feeding to watch the vehicle (Burger and
Gochfeld 2001). Lewis and Slack (1992) suggest that disturbance may severely impact maintenance of
optimal energy budgets or cause injury to whooping cranes.

    Always view cranes from vehicle at least 500 m away, do not approach on foot.
    Avoid placing transmission lines near staging areas.
    Implement a traffic control program with maximum 50 km/hr speed zones day and night within
     1,000 m of staging areas.
    Implement measures to discourage birds from landing in sumps or tailings ponds.

Saskatchewan Environment (2003) recommends that during the breeding season (April 15 to June 30) a
buffer of 100 m, 150 m and 350 m from low, medium and high levels of disturbance, respectively, be kept
between human disturbance and yellow rail nests. Yellow rails are secretive birds that are restricted to the
dense low vegetation of very shallow wetlands. They feed during the daytime and primarily call at night
(Alvo and Robert 1999). Prescott et al (2001) reported that detection of yellow rails using playback calls
improved with darkness and suggested that time of night and lunar phase were factors in detection.

Saskatchewan Environment (2003) does not recommend a setback distance from black-tailed prairie dog
colonies for low-level disturbances, but suggests a 250 m and 500 m buffer between medium and high
levels of disturbance, respectively. A study on the responses of non-habituated black-tailed prairie dogs to
human intrusion found that the furthest distance that triggered a vocal response from a prairie dog was
60 m and the furthest distance that caused a movement response (escape into the burrow) was triggered at
43 m (Adams et al. 1987). A similar study by Magle (2005) found that non-habituated prairie dogs barked
in response to human presence when they were as far as 43 m away and went into the burrow when the
observer was as far as 29 m.

The grey fox is considered extremely rare in Manitoba and only as an accidental. The grey fox’s
distribution is closely associated with deciduous or mixed wood forests. This fox can readily climb trees.
Dens are generally located in dense brush in forested areas and in proximity to wetlands. The home range
is estimated between 30 and 1000 hectares (Judge and Haviernick 2002).

Kissner (2009) and Saskatchewan Environment (2003) recommend buffers between development and
Ord’s kangaroo rat dens throughout the year (Table 13). Increased nighttime illumination and noise near
dens and in home ranges may alter behaviour and potentially decrease survival or reproduction. Kangaroo
rats are known to change their foraging behaviour in response to nighttime light conditions (Tappe 1941,
Justice 1960, Schwab 1966, Lockard and Owings 1974a, Lockard and Owings 1974b, O'Farrell 1974,
Lockard 1975, Kaufman and Kaufman 1982, Kotler 1983, Kotler 1984, Price et al. 1984, Bowers 1988,
Brown et al. 1988, Daly et al. 1992). The hearing of the kangaroo rat is sensitive to low frequency sound,
as specialized auditory structures in the skull enable them to hear predators more efficiently (Webster
1962), and excess noise during active periods may hinder the ability to detect predators. In an experiment
by Brattstrom and Michael (1983), it took 21 days before the normal range of hearing returned to
kangaroo rats exposed to sounds at 95 dBA at close range, decreasing the ability to detect predators such
as owls and snakes. Brattstrom and Michael (1983) suggested that kangaroo rat ears may be particularly
sensitive to sounds with high concentrations of energy in the area of 1.0 to 3.0 kHz. Their sensitivity to
foot drumming, an anti-predator behaviour kangaroo rats use against snakes (Randall and Stevens 1987),
may be affected by seismic activity.
Human activities limited to diurnal hours near kangaroo rat dens may still affect behaviour as Gummer
and Robertson (2003) found that kangaroo rats with burrows near the construction site of a pipeline had a
contraction of their home ranges and suggested a decrease in foraging opportunities. The reduction in
foraging opportunities was suggested as the reason why kangaroo rats near the pipeline entered
hibernation less frequently than the control group (Gummer and Robertson 2003). For this pipeline,
special mitigation measures were put in place which prevented direct mortalities of kangaroo rats at the
pipeline site. The mitigation strategy employed included: conducting specialized surveys to identify den
sites for kangaroo rats; marking of burrows and instructing operators to avoid these sites; restricting
trucks and large vehicles from accessing areas where kangaroo rats occurred; and prohibiting nighttime
construction activities or lighting.

  Do not leave trenches open or create open patches of sand, as this may attract kangaroo rats.
 If seeding is required, use native seed common to the area. Consider Indian rice grass, spear grass,
  Scurf pea, annual sunflower, narrowleaved puccoon, northern wheat grass, prickly pear, western
  bluebur, and sand dropseed but only in areas that will be fully reclaimed and away from potential
  population sinks (e.g. roads, trails), as these represent large components of the natural diet.
 Favor multi-pad sites over single well locations.
 Minimize low frequency sound and excess noise during periods kangaroo rats are active.

Alberta Fish and Wildlife Division (2001) and Saskatchewan Environment (2003) recommend buffers
between development and swift fox dens (Table 14). The effect of pipeline construction on swift fox was
investigated by Moehrenschlager (2000). The study concluded that pre-construction activities (surveys of
pipeline area by individuals on foot, in trucks and on all-terrain vehicles) during the spring and summer
months, less than or equal to 500 m from swift fox dens, reduced reproductive success. It was also
concluded that road mortality was highest between August and October when young foxes became more
mobile (Moehrenschlager 2000). A close relative, the San Joaquin kit fox (Vulpes macrotis mutica) has
shown higher road mortality in areas developed for petroleum extraction compared to undeveloped areas
(O'Farrell 1984). The swift fox has been shown to locate natal dens close to roads (Hines and Ronald
1991, Pruss 1999).

Beneficial Management Practices
 Avoid activities in areas while foxes are breeding, approximately February 15 to August 31.
   Create, implement and enforce a traffic control program with maximum 50 km/hr speed zones day
    and night within 2,000 m of den sites.
    Do not mow rights-of-way or leases, as this will create homogenous areas not favoured by foxes.

The western harvest mouse is a nocturnal, non-fossorial mammal active year round but known to enter a
brief period of torpor (COSEWIC 2007). The western harvest mouse builds grass nests above ground in
dense grass or in low shrubs. The prairie population of the western harvest mouse is poorly studied, but
in other parts of its range the species is known to be more active on moonless nights, therefore increased
nighttime illumination and noise near nests and on home ranges may affect behaviour and survival or
reproduction. Because this species is active above ground year round, individuals are sensitive to
activities that impact the nest. Dispersal distance is generally less than 300m and home range has been
cited as generally between one half to one hectare (COSEWIC 2007).

Several studies have shown that human disturbance, including researchers, near natal or maternal
wolverine dens often causes den abandonment (Pulliainen 1968, Copeland 1996, Magoun and Copeland
1998). Wolverines have extensive home ranges that extend from 100sq km to over 900sq km (Bianci
1994). Females with young have home ranges generally between 50 km and 100 km (Bianci 1994).

Fortin and Andruskiw (2003) investigated the response of free-ranging bison to human disturbance. The
most significant observation was that the probability of a herd of bison with young running from a
snowmobile increased as the distance to the herd decreased. With logistic regression, they determined that
at a distance of 257 m, a herd of bison with young would flee from a snowmobile 50% of the time (Fortin
and Andruskiw 2003). Human disturbance resulted in the distance traveled by bison to increase by 30%,
but did not have a major impact on resource use (Fortin and Andruskiw 2003). A flight response was also
more common for bison that encountered a truck than for bison that encountered a hiker (Fortin and
Andruskiw 2003). A response of alertness occurred when a hiker and cyclist were on average a distance
of 175 m and 149 m respectively from a bison (Taylor and Knight 2003). In the same study a flight
response occurred when a hiker or cyclist was on average, 94 m from the bison (Taylor and Knight 2003).
To minimize disturbance, Fortin and Andruskiw (2003) recommended remaining greater than 260 m from
bison herds.

Saskatchewan Environment (2003) recommends buffer zones of 100 m, 200 m and 1,000 m at low,
medium and high levels of disturbance, respectively, year-round between human disturbance and eastern
yellow-bellied racer hibernacula. Hartline (1971) states that three families of snakes, including
Colubridae, are extremely sensitive to vibrations, indicating the need for further study on the effects of
seismic and other vibrational activities on snakes. Studies on its cousin , the Western Yellow-bellied
Racer, showed an average dispersal distance from denning sites in Utah of 781 m for males and 663 m
for females, although daily movements were generally less than 200m (COSEWIC 2004). Poulin
and Didiuk (2008) estimated that two radio-tracked Eastern racers traveled up to 2000m from their
hibernacula, putting them at risk to road mortality, farm equipment and persecution.

Alberta Fish and Wildlife Division (2001) and Saskatchewan Environment (2003) recommend buffers
between development and suitable habitat for short-horned lizards (Table 15). Based on the specificity of
habitat requirements for the greater short-horned lizard James (2002) recommends that any activity
should occur at least 20 m from coulee rims in areas populated by this species. The inability of this lizard
to move long distances makes relocation of individuals 100 m from an activity a feasible mitigation
technique, if found in or around an area of human disturbance (James 2002). Although temporary home
ranges can be quite small, total home ranges can be up to 4000m2 and some individuals have been
observed moving 100m in one week (James 2004).

The prairie skink has been known to hibernate between 66 cm (Nelson 1963) and 137 cm (Scott and
Sheldahl 1937) below the surface, to frequently return to the same site year after year (COSEWIC 2004),
and is estimated to spend 9.75 months below ground each year (Nelson 1963) making this species
difficult to find and vulnerable to ground disturbance in suitable habitat. Fitch (1954) studied the
Canadian five-lined skink (Eumeces fasciatus) and observed that females during nest excavation and
brooding were prone to nest desertion when disturbed. Nelson (1963) also noted the abandonment of
several nests after disturbances at the nest site. Home ranges rarely exceed 100m (COSEWIC 2004).
Hibernation sites are generally not within the summer home range, but up to 25 m from the summer
home range (COSEWIC 2004).

      9. LITERATURE REVIEW - AMPHIBIANS
Noise from vehicles can change amphibian call behaviour (Barrass 1985, Sun and Narins 2005) and
curtail mating (Barrass 1985). Increased traffic has been shown to increase frog and toad mortality and
reduce frog and toad populations (Fahrig et al. 1995). It has also been shown that toads and frogs depend
upon a specific range of illumination for cues to perform activities relating to vision, such as foraging
(Jaeger and Hailman 1981, Hailman 1984, Buchanan 1993) and possibly mating, therefore excess
illumination or noise at breeding ponds may impact amphibian reproductive success. Water from oil
sands reclaimed wetlands has been shown to negatively affect the development and growth of amphibians
and their populations (Pollet and Bendell-Young 2000; Hersikorn 2009; Gupta 2009). A literature review
of the terrestrial habitats used by 19 frog species in the United States found that the average minimum and
maximum core terrestrial habitats extended out to 205 m and 368 m, respectively, from their aquatic
habitat edge (Semlitsch and Bodie 2003). Semlitsch and Bodie (2003) recommended that an additional
50 m buffer of terrestrial habitat be added to the core terrestrial habitat. Gibbs et al (2007) recommended
a 300m buffer for roads from wetlands in New York State.

Alberta Fish and Wildlife Division (2001) and Saskatchewan Environment (2003) recommend buffers
between development and ponds used by Great Plains toads in all parts of their life cycle (Table 16).
Large numbers of Great Plains toads may be killed upon paved and unpaved roads (Didiuk 1999),
especially if these roads are near breeding wetlands and if they have high traffic. While monitoring the
mortality of common toads on a road near a breeding pond, Cooke (1995) observed less road mortality on
sections of the road furthest from the ponds. Gas well caissons and pipeline trenches may trap individuals
(Didiuk 1999).

Alberta Fish and Wildlife Division (2001) and Saskatchewan Environment (2003) recommend buffers
between development and ponds used by northern leopard frogs in all parts of their life cycle (Table 17).
While monitoring the mortality of vertebrate species on the Long Point Causeway at Lake Erie, Ontario,
Ashley (1996) noticed that leopard frog mortality decreased when habitat adjacent to the causeway was
altered to make it unsuitable for leopard frogs. During leopard frog migration, road mortality can be high
when roads with traffic intersect these migrations (Palis 1994, Linck 2000). A study in Ontario cited the
leopard frog as being a more vagile species and found that traffic density within 1.5km of ponds had a
significant negative effect on abundance (Carr and Fahrig 2001). Similarly, Eigenbrod et al (2009)
observed a significant positive relationship with leopard frog abundance and increasing distance from a
major highway: this relationship extended beyond 1000m.

Beneficial Management Practices
 Maintain a 400 m buffer year-round from seasonal wet areas that have suitable breeding habitat for
     frogs.

  Maintain a 400 m buffer around wetlands known to provide wintering sites for the period of
  September through May to protect frogs moving to and from wintering sites, and during hibernation
  at these sites.
 Do not create barriers to movement.
 Maintain habitat connectivity between wetlands.
 Maintain natural patterns of water level fluctuations (to discourage fish).
 Do not stock fish.
 Leave logs, snags and other woody debris.
 Do not mow when frogs are active or mow with care.

While monitoring the mortality of toads on a road near a breeding pond, Cooke (1995) observed less road
mortality on the sections of road furthest from ponds. Eigenbrod et al (2009) observed decreased
American Toad abundance for a distance of 200 and 300 m from a major highway, in 2007 and 2006
respectively. In Colorado, boreal toads (Bufo boreas boreas) were observed to move 900 m (with
evidence that they may move further) from their summer habitat to an area with 5 hibernacula, that was
shared by 30 toads over the winter months (Campbell 1970). Browne and Symes (2007) observed that
radio-tracked western toads in the boreal region of Alberta moved significantly farther to reach
hibernation sites from their breeding ponds than those in the parkland region, averaging 1042 m and 381
m, respectively. Browne and Symes (2007) also observed that at least 68 percent of the hibernation sites
were communal and Western toads used cavities in peat hummocks, red squirrel middens, natural dry
wetland crevasses, decayed root channels, cavities under spruce trees, abandoned beaver lodges, and
muskrat tunnels. To reduce disturbance during hibernation, western toad hibernacula should be searched
for and avoided.

 1.0 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
These guidelines constitute advice only. All persons must adhere to all pertinent laws,
regulations and permit requirements including but not restricted to the Species at Risk Act
(SARA). In order to protect individual plants and their critical habitat and adhere to pertinent
laws, regulations and permit requirements, alternatives to these guidelines may be necessary in
some circumstances. The appropriateness of measures used to protect individual plant species at
risk and their critical habitat will be determined on a case-by-case basis by considering all
pertinent facts, including but not limited, to these guidelines. If there is any doubt about the
effectiveness of these guidelines in protecting plant species at risk and their critical habitat, a
SARA permit should be sought prior to initiating potentially harmful activities. For information
on the SARA, please consult the SARA Registry at http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca; the Act itself
can found in the Registry at http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca/approach/act/default_e.cfm; SARA
Schedule 1 species (endangered, threatened, and special concern risk categories) in any region of
Canada can be found at: http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca/sar/listing/schedules_e.cfm?id=1.
These Plant Setback Distance Guidelines were developed for use in Manitoba, Saskatchewan
and Alberta. These guidelines represent advice to help land managers make proactive mitigation
decisions about NEW industrial disturbances, agricultural or recreational activities on natural
landscapes dominated by native vegetation where plant species at risk (Table 1) occur on federal
lands. These guidelines are not intended to change activities required for the maintenance and
operation of EXISTING developments and infrastructure. Specifically, these guidelines will help
land managers and development proponents avoid the:
       Killing, harming or harassing endangered or threatened plant species at risk individuals
        (Section 32 & 36 of the Species At Risk Act);
       Destroying any part of the critical habitat of an endangered or threatened plant species at
        risk (Sections 58, 60 and 61 of the Species At Risk Act);
       Contravening any other regulations established from an action plan (Section 53),
        management plan (Section 71), or otherwise established to protect critical habitat
        (Section 59 of the Species at Risk Act).
Plant species at risk are currently afforded protection under the SARA on federal lands, and
these guidelines are intended for application on those lands at this time (e.g., military bases,
federal community pastures, and National Wildlife Areas). Provincial legislation may now or in
the future extend similar protection to provincial, municipal or private lands. Where provincial
guidelines are not available, we encourage proponents of new developments to use these
guidelines as advice for mitigating risks to plant species at risk.
Environment Canada, in cooperation with the Recovery Team for Plant Species at Risk in the
                 Activity Set-back Distance Guidelines for Prairie Plant Species at Risk
Prairie Provinces, will review any proposed revisions to these guidelines. Environment Canada
will update these guidelines on at least a 5 year cycle beginning in 2015. This document has the
endorsement of the Recovery Team for Plant Species at Risk in the Prairie Provinces.
2.0 BACKGROUND
Set-back distance guidelines exist for a number of recreational, agricultural and industrial
activities that take place adjacent to human habitations or other valued locations (e.g. AEUB
2006, Alberta Government 2006, BC Ministry of Environment 2006). Most set-back distance
guidelines for wildlife species at risk in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta rely on science
and expert opinion to rank industrial activities, and the perceived magnitude and risk of each
(Scobie & Faminow 2001; ASRD 2001; SKCDC 2003); Environment Canada is currently
refining guidelines for prairie animal species at risk, and new guidelines are being developed in
Alberta based on detailed literature reviews (Joel Nicholson pers. comm.). The impact of
activities on wildlife takes into account that animals are mobile, respond behaviourally to
industrial noise and movement, and can quickly return once noise and movement subside, even
using drastically disturbed habitats. Conversely, plants are sessile and must be considered
separately; plants are oblivious to noise and movement, most are adapted to survive some
aboveground trampling and defoliating damage, but most soil disturbance can kill individual
plants and destroy part of the critical habitat 1 . Additionally, cumulative edge effects or chronic
disturbance have significant potential to gradually destroy critical habitat and thereby threaten
long-term survival of these sessile organisms.
Scientific literature specifically addressing set-backs for conserving species at risk in grassland
ecosystems is not readily available. As such, the following guidelines represent an interpretation
of related literature and expert opinions. There is a body of scientific knowledge emerging on
industrial “edge effects” and “buffer zones”, but this research has focused on watershed and
animal protection in forested environments (Ries et al. 2004), with few examples for plants (i.e.
Honnay et al. 2005) and fewer still for grassland plants (i.e. Hansen & Clevenger 2005).
Research to investigate edge effects on plant species at risk is identified as a needed activity in
recovery strategies completed or in development; thus, the following guidelines are
precautionary. Adjustments to these guidelines will be made once results of research are
available, to reflect the improved state of knowledge at that time. However, because new

  While some soil disturbance can create or maintain habitat for populations of some annual plant species at risk like
small-flowered sand verbena, the SARA legislation prohibits the killing of “individual” plants under Sections 32
and 36, and the destruction of critical habitat under Sections 58, 60, and 61. Enforcement officers are not in a
position to make judgments about what is good for the population. However, these officers can very easily make
judgments about what is injurious for individuals as described in Sections 32 and 36, and use recovery strategy
information to determine what constitutes destruction of critical habitat prohibited under Sections 58, 60 and 61.
Where potential conservation conflicts arise, it is best to consult Environment Canada and recommended
management practices for the species; permits under Sections 73, 74 or 78 to contravene Sections 32, 36, 58, 60 or
61 for the good of the population may be applicable. Future regulations established under Sections 53 or 59 may
address this particular concern.

                Activity Set-back Distance Guidelines for Prairie Plant Species at Risk
information may become available before these guidelines are updated, project proponents
should review any new, pertinent information to assess the applicability of these set-backs to
their particular circumstances.
Set-back distance guidelines for “valued ecosystem components”, like plant species at risk and
their critical habitat, should be based upon “reasonable and foreseeable” potential cumulative
edge effects imposed by several direct and indirect human activities (Hegmann et al. 1999). For
example, it may not matter to a plant whether a pipeline installation: 1) used small or large
diameter pipe, because there can be direct and irreversible mortality within the area disturbed; 2)
took a single day or 3 months to complete, because cumulative edge effects can continue
indefinitely afterwards; or 3) has limited road and trail traffic, because road traffic tends to
increase following installation. Thus, the set-backs should address both acute disturbance
impacts and potential cumulative impacts of chronic disturbance activities.
Recovery Strategies for plant species at risk in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta provide
further guidance on what constitutes disturbance or destruction to plant species in at risk
habitats. In regards to critical habitat, destruction would result if part of the critical habitat were
degraded, either permanently or temporarily, such that it would not serve its function when
needed by the species. Destruction may result from single or multiple activities at one point in
time or from the cumulative effects of one or more activities over time. No consideration of the
spatial proportion destroyed, or the temporal duration of destruction is considered in this
document.
3.0 SET-BACK DISTANCE RECOMMENDATIONS
There is no set-back distance for a number of existing and traditional land uses or natural
disturbance regimes; examples of Class 1: 0 m activities are described in Table 2. Two
additional classes of set-backs have been created to provide protection from more severe acute or
chronic disturbances.
3.1 Protecting Plants and Habitats from Acute Disturbance (Class 2: 30 m)
A minimum set-back distance of 30 m from all detectable individuals is recommended in this
case.
The Species at Risk Act prohibits the killing or harming of individuals under Sections 32 and 36.
Those individuals are defined to include “a part or derivative of an individual”, “at any
developmental stage and includes…embryos, seeds, pollen, spores and asexual propagules.”
Technical violations occur at distinct points in time when removal of a single leaf, root, seed or
any other part of a plant occurs, in which case extreme precaution is required when in proximity
to these species. Some examples of activities likely to result in those violations are described in
Table 2.
                                                    3
                Activity Set-back Distance Guidelines for Prairie Plant Species at Risk
The rationale for a 30 m buffer stems from a number of sources. The only research found to
actually describe edge effects on short-term survival of plant species at risk, indicated 40 m was
the minimum distance needed to avoid negative impacts of road dust (Gleason et al. 2007); that
was also the maximum distance at which measurements were made. Research elsewhere
indicated a single contact with humans can affect a plant’s susceptibility to herbivory,
parasitism, disease and ultimately growth, reproductive output and survival (Cahill et al. 2001;
Hik et al. 2003). There is also a rapid decline in survival and biomass of many plant species with
an increase in frequency of trampling by people, their livestock and their vehicles (Liddle 1991;
Yorks et al. 1997; Leung & Marion 1996). Much of that damage in prairies occurs under wet
conditions, and particularly to rhizomatous growth forms (Dickson et al. 2008). This type of
damage can occur several meters beyond the location of easily detected aboveground stems,
where many perennial plants have roots and buds just beneath the soil surface. Most plants also
produce a soil seedbank, and each seed represents a living and genetically unique individual.
Long distance dispersal events are common in plants, but the large part of a soil seedbank exists
in a “shadow” of several meters surrounding the known locations of parent plants (Okubo &
Levin 1989). Based on these sources of information, a 30 m buffer was selected.
3.2 Protecting Plants and Habitats from Acute and Chronic Disturbance (Class 3: 300 m)
A minimum set-back distance of 300 m from all detectable individuals is recommended in this
case.
The Species at Risk Act prohibitions for killing and harming individuals (Sections 32 and 36) do
not distinguish damage due to acute or chronic disturbance, although the latter is very important
to consider for sessile organisms like plants. Chronic disturbance likely to result in the ultimate
killing or harming of an individual plant is also likely to destroy all or part of the habitat critical
to the survival of those plants (also prohibited under Sections 58 and 61). Technical violations
may only be identified at a distinct point in time, but may have been preceded by repeated and
incremental harm to the plant and its habitat, and/or are likely to be followed by repeated and
incrementally harmful activities. In anticipation of these cumulative effects to plants and their
habitats, the guidelines are intended to help all potential contributors avoid adding to those
effects. Some examples of these activities are described in Table 2.
The rationale for a 300 m buffer stems from a number of sources. In detailed reviews by Forman
& Alexander (1998) and Forman et al. (2003) most roadside edge effects resulting from
construction and repeated traffic have their greatest impact within the first 30 to 50 m, but
salinity, nitrogen and hydrological effects could extend 100 to 200 m, and alien invasive species
may spread up to 1 km. Hansen & Clevenger (2005) observed no decline in the frequency of
invasive alien species encountered up to 150 m away from roads and railways in a grassland
environment, although they did not sample further than 150 m. Gelbard & Harrison (2005)
concluded that edge effects of roads on the plant and soil habitat was such that invasive species
could more readily establish and survive within 10 m of roads compared with plants up to 1000
m from roads. Different types of roads appear to have different effects: paved or graded roads
tend to have a higher cover and richness of invasive species than 4 x 4 vehicle tracks, but both
                                                   4
                Activity Set-back Distance Guidelines for Prairie Plant Species at Risk
created habitat for dispersal and establishment of invasive species in roadside verges and up to
50 m away (Gelbard & Belnap 2003). The greater frequency of traffic and intensity of
disturbance on improved roads merely speeds the process of invasion. Accepting that significant
effects of invasive species can be detected up to 150 m from roads and other developed sites, and
invasive species can occur up to 1 km from roads, a compromise buffer distance of 300 m was
selected. Considering the road density typical of the Canadian prairies every 1.6 to 3.2 km, it is
unlikely that source populations for invasive alien species can be accurately identified beyond
800 m from roadside edges (the centre of a section assuming it is surrounded by roads).
Research is needed to evaluate the cumulative effects of sulphur and nitrogen emissions and
deposition on surrounding soils and survival of plant species at risk because elevated deposition
from such emission-producing facilities has been detected in plants and soils 1-2 km away
(Meshalkina et al. 1996; Hao et al. 2006). However, it is not clear if these detectable levels are
biologically meaningful. Regionally, Kochy & Wilson (2001) observed nitrogen deposition in
Elk Island National Park several km downwind of petroleum refineries and an urban center to be
22 kg ha-1 year-1, while background rates in the wilderness at Jasper National Park were only 8
kg ha-1 year-1; these increased rates appeared to promote forest encroachment into native
grasslands. Experiments by Plassmann et al. (2008) found that low additions of nitrogen (15 kg
ha-1 year-1) to sand dunes increased germination rates of annual plants from the seedbank. This
risks depleting the seedbank and eliminating a species from a low-nitrogen site to which it is
adapted. Worse yet, some of the invasive species themselves like sweet clover (Melilotus
officinale) can elevate soil nitrogen content through biological fixation and facilitate invasions
by other alien species (Jordan et al. 2008). In light of these findings, a 300 m buffer is a
reasonable and precautionary compromise.
4.0 ALTERNATIVES TO SET-BACK DISTANCE RECOMMENDATIONS
There are a number of instances where strict adherence to these set-back distances could result in
greater destruction of native vegetation, actions that are contradictory to best management
practices for the same species, or otherwise do not achieve the intent of the protective measures.
In all of these cases, alternatives to these recommendations should be considered, and, where
appropriate, a permit may be required.
4.1 Contradiction with Best Management Practices for Plant Species at Risk
Set-back distances can be lifted, reduced or modified seasonally, year-round or on a case-by-case
basis where contradictions arise between these guidelines and recommended best management
practices for plant species at risk and their habitat (established pursuant to Sections 41 “recovery
strategies”, 49 “action plans”, 56 “codes of practice, national standards or guidelines with
respect to the protection of critical habitat”, or otherwise endorsed by Environment Canada in
cooperation with the recovery team established for those plant species at risk). Some examples
of conflicts and resolutions include:

        construction, reclamation, or flooding from a pipeline rupture. However, if grazing is a
        recommended management practice and grazing cannot occur without a water supply for
        the livestock, a pipeline installation may be the best land management decision. To
        protect the land manager from any liability, application for a Species at Risk permit or
        agreement is recommended to allow such an installation contrary to the recommended
        set-back distance or timing restriction. These permits are issued pursuant to Sections 73,
        74 or 78 of the SARA, and can be obtained from Environment Canada for federal lands.
    2. Restrictions on new fencing or salting stations are put in place due to risks of altered
        grazing pressure threatening survival of existing individual plants and critical habitat.
        However, if a more intensively managed grazing system is a recommended management
        practice for maintaining or enhancing the population or habitat for the species, a fence or
        salting station installation may be the best land management decision. To reduce liability
        for the land user, an application for a SARA permit or agreement is recommended to
        carry out these activities contrary to the recommended set-back distance or timing
        restriction. These permits are issued pursuant to Sections 73, 74 or 78 of the SARA, and
        can be obtained from Environment Canada for federal lands.
    3. Restrictions on herbicide, mowing or haying are put in place due to risks of damaging
        actively growing or flowering plants, or subsequently collecting and possessing
        individual plant parts like seeds. However, if a carefully timed and applied herbicide,
        mowing or haying system is a recommended management practice for maintaining or
        enhancing the population or habitat for the species, that particular type of herbicide
        application, mowing or haying activity may be the best land management decision. To
        reduce liability for the land user, an application for a SARA permit or agreement is
        recommended to carry out these activities contrary to the recommended set-back distance
        or timing restriction. These permits are issued pursuant to Sections 73, 74 or 78 of the
        SARA, and can be obtained from Environment Canada for federal lands.
4.2 Seasonal Lifting of Set-backs for Annual Plants
All activities described under Class 2: 30 m set-backs (Table 2) can be reclassified as Class 1: 0
m during the winter period of seed dormancy from October 1 through to March 31 of each
year, for annual plant species at risk. However, activities described under Class 3: 300 m set-
backs remain unchanged, as the impacts of those land uses occur independent of season.
Annual plants rely entirely on germination from a soil seed bank for genetic out-crossing and
dispersal over time (Nunney 2002; Templeton & Levin 1979). The period of time between
germination and seed dispersal is a crucial period for annual plants not to be disturbed within 30
m, however individual seeds are not normally at risk from trampling during the winter period of
seed dormancy. Conversely, perennial plants largely rely on vegetative growth and asexual
reproduction for population persistence over time (Silvertown & Charlesworth 2001). For that
reason, primary set-back distance restrictions should continue to apply throughout the year
                                                   6
               Activity Set-back Distance Guidelines for Prairie Plant Species at Risk
surrounding known perennial and biennial plant species at risk occurrences.
4.3 Maintenance or Redevelopment within Existing Disturbed Footprints
No new development should be allowed within 300 m of a plant species at risk occurrence unless
it occurs in an area where there is an existing disturbance that is similar in nature to the
disturbance that will be caused by the new development, with the following restrictions:
      1. no expansion of the disturbed area into undisturbed areas; and
      2. no activity within 30m of an individual plant within the existing disturbed area; and
      3. impact monitoring for 5 years (protocol to follow).
Many plant occurrences are located within 300 m or 30 m of existing disturbances, such as
roadside edges, cultivated lands, and petroleum well pads. In all of these cases, the majority of
the damage has already been done to the habitat or individuals, and continued maintenance of the
existing disturbances is almost always necessary for public safety or socio-economic reasons.
Redevelopment or upgrading of a site, such as paving an existing gravel road, re-grading road
ditches, or directionally drilling from an existing petroleum well pad is likely to add some
disturbance, but those impacts are minimal when faced with the prospect of adding new roads
and well pads to the landscape. In these cases, strict adherence to the set-back distances does not
always make sense. To reduce liability for the land user, an application for a SARA permit or
agreement is recommended to carry out these activities contrary to the recommended set-back
distance or timing restriction. These permits are issued pursuant to Sections 73, 74 or 78 of the
SARA, and can be obtained from Environment Canada for federal lands. In the case of repeated
or routine maintenance where a plant species at risk or critical habitat will be disturbed or
destroyed, a multi-year permit (3 years) or agreement (5 years) may be issued along with
requirements for impact monitoring (e.g., monthly grading of a gravel road where plant species
at risk occur on road edges or in the ditch). Monitoring protocols are being developed to support
the monitoring requirement described above.
5.0 RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES
The intent of set-back distances is to re-route, re-locate, or re-time proposed new disturbances
(Figure 1), and the only alternative mitigations considered at this time are described above in
Section 4. The following sections call for further research, but it is important to emphasize that
this research needs to use relevant hypotheses for mitigating effects on plant species at risk
survival and persistence, and requires attention to both type 1 and type 2 errors in the
interpretation of results (see McGarvey 2007).
5.1 Minimum Disturbance Construction Techniques for Pipelines and Wellsites
                                                   7
               Activity Set-back Distance Guidelines for Prairie Plant Species at Risk
The setback distance for all pipelines is a minimum of 300 m regardless of diameter, contents, or
construction method. Even where minimum disturbance construction for “ploughed-in” narrow-
diameter pipelines occurs to supply livestock water or petroleum, cumulative surface impacts are
anticipated that could threaten individual plant species at risk or their critical habitat.
Construction involves heavy equipment trampling, and the removal and replacement of intact
native grassland sod over a narrow and shallow trench in the same day; no further reclamation
actions are taken (Sinton 2001). This approach is normally recommended to reduce
environmental impacts, and improve the chances of meeting reclamation success criteria by
means of natural recovery. However, temporary damage to plant species at risk individuals,
populations and habitat cannot be mitigated as easily.
First, water, hydrocarbons or other fluids leaking from pipeline ruptures will have an edge effect
that varies greatly depending upon topography of the site. For example, an Alberta Energy
Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) investigation during 2008 at CFB Suffield found a
surface leak of crude oil spread 165 m along ungulate trails and ultimately covered 1200 m2 of
native grassland killing more than 200 migratory birds (ERCB Investigation Report 2009-06-18 -
http://www.ercb.ca/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_240_2587475_0_0_18/). A second
incident investigated by ERCB involved a natural gas blowout that released “lower explosive
levels” of gas at 100% within 50 m of a wellhead decreasing to 0% at 500 m, and a spill of fluids
up to 25 m from the head that resulted in excavation and removal of 540 tonnes of soil for
remediation (ERCB Investigation Report 2009-06-01 -
http://www.ercb.ca/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_240_2587482_0_0_18/). ERCB
investigations elsewhere have found oil spills that spread 1.6 km across the surface from rupture
points before clean-up could begin (ERCB Investigation Report 2007-05-09 -
http://www.ercb.ca/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_240_2587477_0_0_18/). Plants are
not mobile, so flooding and inundation for any period of time may be sufficient to quickly kill
individual plants adapted to semiarid terrestrial ecosystems, and could destroy critical habitat for
several months, years, or decades. If evidence indicates the probability of such a rupture is low,
in proportion to the density of all existing and planned pipelines, and in proportion to habitat
availability and species at risk occupancy in the area, there could be a case for modifying this
set-back for this particular land use. Further research is needed to answer this question.
Secondly, once a linear disturbance like a pipeline is introduced to the landscape, it is common
for new trails and pipelines to parallel this disturbance. In effect, a single pipeline installation
sets in motion future cumulative impacts that would not have otherwise occurred had the
pipeline not been installed in the first place (Scobie & Faminow 2001). Some of those impacts
could include the invasion of alien invasive plant species. Narrowing pipeline right-of-way width
may reduce the initial area disturbed, but this logically has less influence on edge effects
compared to right-of-way length. Therefore, regardless of the method used for construction, the
edge effects may ultimately be the same. If evidence indicates that some types of pipeline
construction do not result in these cumulative traffic or invasive species effects, there could be a
case for modifying this set-back. Further research is needed to answer this question.
Thirdly, the long-lasting changes in soil physical, chemical and biological properties can change
the habitat indefinitely (Naeth et al. 1993; 1987), and may indefinitely prevent recolonization by
                                                   8
               Activity Set-back Distance Guidelines for Prairie Plant Species at Risk
a plant species at risk if it was killed during construction. The response of most plant species at
risk to changes in soil physical, chemical and biological properties is not known, but if evidence
indicates some types of industrial disturbances have neutral impacts there could be a case for
modifying this set-back. Further research is also needed to answer this question.
5.2 Plant or Seed Salvage, Transplanting and Translocation
Environment Canada and the Recovery Team for Plant Species at Risk in the Prairie Provinces
have not endorsed any “salvage” methods for translocating or reseeding plant species at risk,
where individuals could be or have been destroyed by industrial activities. Initial demonstration
projects and follow-up monitoring with a few occurrences of other rare plant species indicates
variable mitigation success and some possible approaches that warrant further investigation (i.e.
Fahselt 2007; Fryer et al. 2002; AXYS Environmental Consulting Ltd. 2006; Allen 1994). Until
such time that species-specific research on the habitat requirements, regeneration ecology, and
genetic diversity of these species leads to scientifically defensible methods for translocation,
reseeding, or other conservation measures (see Falk et al. 1996; Austin 2004; Fahselt 2007), it is
these set-back distance and timing restriction guidelines that take precedence This research will
be reviewed every 5 years according to the schedule of recovery strategy updates required under
the SARA, at which time revisions to acceptable alternative mitigations may be made. In all of
those cases, permits would be required to gather seed or translocate plants on federal lands.

1: The rationale for these set-backs is described in Section 3, and alternative mitigations and exemptions are
described in Section 4.
BMP: “Beneficial Management Practice” is a land management activity that is consistent with natural disturbance
regimes, needed to mimic those regimes, or to control alien invasive species all of which benefits the population and
habitat of a species, despite possible incidental losses to individual plants. In these cases, the set-backs could be
lifted seasonally or year-round, or otherwise modified to accommodate the beneficial management practice. These
will vary according to species, and the SARA public registry should be consulted for more information.
DD: “Directional Drilling” for water or petroleum can occur beneath plant species at risk occurrences, as long as the
surface disturbance is at least 300 m away, and drilling depth is below the rooting zone of plants.
Annual plants may have Class 2 activities changed to Class 1 from October 1 to March 31 (see Section 4.2).

Dear Ms. Erickson:

Hearing Order OH-3-2011 regarding Vantage Pipeline Canada Inc. (Vantage) Vantage

Pipeline Project Application of February 7, 2011

In accordance with the direction provided by National Energy Board (the Board) in its Hearing
Order OH-3-2011 of 5 April 2011, Environment Canada (EC) is providing this letter of comment
to the Board as a part of the public hearing regarding Vantage Pipeline Project proposal
application of February 7, 2011.
EC has made several (19) recommendations to Vantage Pipeline Canada Inc. (the Proponent)
as it relates to this project. The comments and recommendations, based on specialist or expert
information or knowledge provided by EC to the Responsible Authority (RA), are within the
department’s mandate as defined through the specific statues and regulations assigned to the
Minister of the Environment and through the Federal Authority (FA) role and responsibilities in
pursuant to section 12(3) of the Canadian Environmental; Assessment Act.
EC is providing comments based on departmental responsibilities as defined by the following
legislation and associated policies:

(3) Department of the Environment Act

(b) Migratory Birds Convention Act and Regulations

(c) Species at Risk Act

(d) Canadian Environmental Protection Act

(e) The Federal Policy on Wetland Conservation
E C has reviewed the following documents submitted for the proposed Vantage Pipeline Project:
. Vantage Volume I: NEB Application under Section 52
. Vantage Volume II: Environmental and Socio-Economic Assessment
. Vantage Volume III: Environmental and Socio-Economic Assessment - Appendices
. Vantage Pipeline Project - Additional Written Evidence - Environmental and Socio-Economic

Update - June 2011
. Vantage Pipeline Project - Supplementary Environmental Reports - July 25, 2011

2.2.5 Piping Plover
EC notes that there is no information on the Piping Ptover in the EIS addendums despite
planned Piping Plover surveys for 2011. EC also notes that flooding and high water tevels in
southern Saskatchewan during 2011 may have prevented piping plovers from breeding in the .
project atea this year. .
11. Environment Canada recommends: :
0 additional surveys for Ptping Plover be carried out in 2012 on all suitable habitats
that occur in the project area within or near the recommended 250m setback; and
o in the event that Piping Plover are observed in the project area, 250m setback from ;
active nesting beaches from May 1 to July 31 and a 200m setback from August 1 to
September1 are observed.
2.2.6 Sprague’s Pipit
EC notes that the Proponent has listed pre-construction nest surveys, including nest dragging to
detect Sprague’s Pipit, to mitigate the impacts of clearing and construction during the breeding
season (p. 296). EC reminds the Proponent that no clearing or construction should take place
between Aprit 15 and August 31 in any habitat that may support Sprague’s Pipit or other .
migratory bird species at risk. In addition, Sprague’s Pipit nests are difficult to find, and birds
singing above territories or behaviour indicative of nesting should be interpreted as evidence of
nests.
12. Environment Canada recommends a 350m setback from active Sprague’s Pipit nests
from May 1 to August 31. I
2.2.7 Yellow Rail ?
EC notes that the EIS describes the potential for Yellow Rait in the project area. EC requests
that the Proponent clarify whether surveys were conducted to detect Yellow Rail. If a survey
was conducted, EC requests the results of the surveys conducted to detect Yellow Rat! from the
Proponent.
2.2.8. Arthmpods
EC notes that the Proponent plans to record habitat for SARA—tisted arthropods during
July/August 2011 (p. 52 of Supplemental Surveys July 25th). EC reminds the Proponent of their
commitment to survey specifically for Dusky Dune Moth, Pale Yetlow Dune Moth, Gold—edged
Gem, Monarch (butterfly), and Mormon Metatmark it appropriate habitat is traversed by the
Pipetine or where host plants occur along the route (Vantage Response to the NEB Information
Request No. 3. (A29664), document 814-12 - Attachment 3.16(b-2) A1Z7U7). in addition, the
assessment of the environmental effects of the Project on these species has not been
completed and should be included in the final report.
_ 3 _

13. Environment Canada recommends:
o a 100m setback from suitable habitat and occupied host plants for Dusky Dune Moth,
Gotd~edged Gem, Pale Yellow Dune Moth, Mormon Metalmark; and
o a 30m setback from occupied host plants for Monarch.
2.2.9. Plant Species At Risk i
To date, no plant species at risk have been observed by the Proponent; however, critical habitat :
for Slender Mouse-ear Cress has been declared in a township adjacent to the pipeiine (NE 6- :
14-24 W3M), and Slender Mouse-ear Cress, Tiny Cryptanthe, Smooth Goosefoot, and Small—
flowered Sand Verbena have the potential to occur in the project area.
14. In the event that plant species at risk are observed in the project area, Environment .
Canada recommends: :
o a 300m no construction or disturbance buffer be observed; and
0 all critical habitats be avoided.
EC notes the Proponents mitigation options for rare plants include transplantation (p. 239) and '
seedbank salvage (p. 240). The Recovery Team for Plant Species at Risk for the Prairies does :
not currently support the technique of transplantation or seedbank salvage with reseeding for '
plant species at risk. As such, EC does not recommend transplantation or seedbank salvage or .
reseeding.
2.2.10. Alkaline Wing-Nerved Moss
EC requests clarity whether consultants searched for Alkaline ng-nerved Moss in the project
area. EC advises the Pr0ponent that vertical structures such as pump stations associated with .
oil and gas infrastructure witl lead to a loss in habitat effectiveness as several species (e.g.,
Sprague’s Pipit, Sharp-tail Grouse) will avoid habitat near vertical structures.
15. Environment Canada recommends that vertical structures be minimized to the extent :
feasible and painted to a colour that biends in with the landscape observed during the
breeding season.
ﬂ Wetlands
To date, almost 400 wetlands have been documented directly on the pipeline route or within
30m. Wetland surveys are not yet complete and it is anticipated that additional wetlands witl be ;
impacted by the pipeline. EC notes that the Proponeht is currently considering mitigation options
for wetlands traversed by the project (p. 4 Vantage Additional Written Evidence (A29650), '
document 812-6 - Environmentat and Socio-Economic Assessment Update A1Z703) and that
proposed mitigation measures will be available in September 2011.
The prairie landscape has suffered extensive wetland loss and drainage. EC notes that, as a
result of the pipeline construction, there will be areas with a loss of wettand function for years
until the habitat recovers and, in several instances, the habitat wilt be permanently modified. -
Recoveries of wetland habitats are dependent on environmental conditions and, during extreme 1
wet or dry conditions, recovery may become protracted. In addition, cattail and bullrush beds,
_ 9 _

willows and trees witl take many years to re-estabtish. The Proponent also states that there will
be management of woody growth on the ROW.
Federal Policy on Wetland Conservation (FPWC)
The objective of the Federal Government with respect to wetland conservation is to “promote :
the conservation of Canada’s wetlands to sustain their ecological and socioeconomic functions,
now and in the future”. In support of the above objective, the Federal Government, in
cooperation with the provinces and territories and the Canadian public, wili strive to achieve the
following goals: i
. maintenance of the functions and values derived from wetlands throughout Canada;
. no net loss of wetland functions on all federal lands and waters; ‘
. enhancement and rehabilitation of wetlands in areas where the continuing loss or
degradation of wetlands or their functions have reached criticat levels; and
o recognition of wetland functions in resource planning, management and economic decision- ;
making with regard to ait federal programs, policies and activities.
Mitigation Measures: 5
To achieve no net loss of wetlands, the federal government adopted the wetland mitigation
framework established by the North American Wetlands Conservation Council (1998 and 2000). f
Federai decisionamakers are expected to ensure that project proponents on lands supporting
wetlands implement a hierarchical progression of mitigation alternatives, as follows:
o avoid damage or destruction of wetlands; ;
o minimize the unavoidable impacts; and
o compensate for residual impacts that cannot be minimized.
Compensation has been defined as action taken at another location to offset the negative
impacts of an undertaking on the functions and/or area of a particularwettand. Compensation
efforts, in turn, should implement the following hierarchical progression:
a restoration of degraded wettands (i.e., return of a totally or highiy~altered natural wetland to
its previous function); i
o enhancement of existing wetlands (i.e., the increase of one or more values of ail or a portion
of an existing wetland, through human actions); and
9 creation of a wetland (i.e., conversion of a non-wetland area into a wetland through human
action).
EC notes that the Proponent had previously indicated that due to the pipeline size, in most i
cases, the pipeline would be routed to avoid wetlands (Vantage Response to the NEB
Information Request No. 3. (A29664), document 814-12 - Attachment 3.16(b-2) A1Z7U7);
however, no simiiar commitments have been made in the EIS documents provided to date.
16. Environment Canada recommends that, prior to project commencement, the
Proponent:
. describe the extent (hectares) by type of wetlands that will be impacted by the
project;
0 provide EC with detailed wetland compensation measures including restoration of
existing degraded wetlands, enhancement of existing wetlands, and creation of
replacement wetlands;
- 10 -

. discuss how the proposed measures would be expected to meet the Federal Policy
on Wetland Consen/ation, and ‘3
. provide EC with a detailed monitoring program to monitor the success of the wetland
compensation to ensure wettand function can be restored and that the no net loss of
wetland function can be achieved. ;
2.3, Invasive Species ‘
Invasive species spread readily along disturbance corridors and once established are virtually :
impossible to eradicate. To date, multiple invasive species (61) were recorded in the project
area, 29 of which are considered noxious in Saskatchewan (p. 228). Given the proposed
development of new disturbance corridors and the potential future intrusion of several invasive g
species into native prairie and wetland areas, or atong watercourses, aggressive weed and j
invasive species management is required from cradle to grave. '
EC acknowledges the Proponent’s plans to record and clearly mark weed infestations prior to
construction, to provide personnel with weed identification training, to ensure that any
equipment used is clean and free of dirt and plant materials to avoid spreading weed species, to
use frequent cleaning stations of equipment along ROW during construction, and to implement .
a weed monitoring and control program (Appendix A) during reclamation and Operations (p.
247) ;
_2__.__5_ Reclamation
EC notes the Proponent's recommended seed mixes (Appendix A, Section 1.9)
17. Environment Canada recommends: 3
o reclamation seed mixtures should mimic the dominant native vegetation in the
surrounding area, be of local provenance, and be certified and inspected to be free
of invasive and noxious weed materials; and
o the use of Western Wheatgrass not exceed 1045 percent in any mix.
EC atso notes that the proposed project plans to traverse sensitive sandy areas. The sandy
nature of these soils and the topography of such areas wilt make stabilization and reclamation
chatlenging. Once surface vegetation is disturbed (e.g., as pipelines are trenched in), some
areas will be very susceptible to erosion. Previous gas developments in areas nearby have had
difficutty stabitizing trails and pipelines, particularly in sandy areas of rough topography and
steep inclines.
18. Environment Canada recommends that all efforts should be made to ensure that
pipetine right of way, access traits, and common corridors avoid sandy ridges, steep
inclines, rough topography, etc.
gig; Monitoring .
EC notes that the Proponent has committed to post-construction monitoring assessments to
determine effectiveness of mitigation measures pertaining to; native plant communities, rare
ptants, wildtife and wildlife habitat, and wetlands traversed by the proposed pipeline ROW. EC
- 11 _

requests an opportunity to re view the Proponents monitoring reports, with particular interest in e
the reproductive success of impacted SA RA species, the progress of reclamation of native ;
species on the ROW and the success in preventing the incursion of invasive species. :
L7 Cumutative Effects
EC notes that a cumulative effects assessment was carried out by the Proponent and that there
is potential for project activities to act cumulatively with other past, present and future activities,
including the recently approved Keystone XL Project. EC notes that the Preponent plans to
work with Keystone XL Pipeline to mitigate the cumulative effects of both pipelines being
constructed during similartime frames. ‘
E Emergency Prevention, Preparedness and Response Planning
19. Environment Canada recommends:
o Project~retated spilt contingency and emergency response plans be provided to the
appropriate regutatory agencies for review.
. The Plans referred to in this recommendation are consistent with industry standard 3
publications such as Emergency Planning for tndustry_(CAN/CSA—Z731). '
o The environmental emergency response plans developed includes, at minimum, the ?
following:
0 an inventory of petroleum products, chemicals and other hazardous
substances and associated storage facitities and iocations to be used during
construction and operational phases;
0 identification of resources (equipment and staff) to be on-site and/or available
to respond to environmental emergencies;
o procedures for responding to spilis and releases including an incident
reporting and notification system;
0 a list of response organizations and their respective roles;
o cleanup and disposat procedures for generated wastes; and
o monitoring and follow-up procedures to ensure that mitigative measures are
effective.
0 The environmental emergency response plans address, at minimum, the
following:
o the types of emergencies that might reasonably be expected to occur,
including potentiat on-site and off-site consequences;
0 prevention (evaluation of risks); preparedness (resources and training);
response (notification and mobitization of resources); and recovery
(assessment of damages and restoration of environment); and
o the process for involvement of communities and stakeholders who may be
impacted by an environmental emergency or involved in an emergency
response.

1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION ,
EC understands that Vantage Pipeline Canada Inc. (the Proponent) is proposing to construct
the Vantage Pipeline Project (the Pipeline, the Project), consisting of approximately 705 km of z
273 mm (10”) outside diameter, high vapour pressure steel pipeline and related facilities.
The Vantage Pipeline will carry liquid ethane from Hess Corporation's natural gas processing
plant near Tioga, North Dakota, US. through Saskatchewan and tie into the Alberta Ethane
Gathering System (AEGS) near Empress, Alberta. Completion of the Vantage Ptpeline is I
proposed for the latter part of 2012. §
The Pipeline will be designed to transport up to 6,400 cubic metres (40,000 barrels) of liquid jé
ethane per day, and will be expandable to 8,600 cubic metres per day (54,000 barrels per day). Q
The maximum operating pressure (MOP) will be 9,930 kilopascals (1,440 pounds per square
inch). 2
Approximately 127 km of the proposed pipeline will be located in North Dakota, 575 km in
Saskatchewan, and three km in Alberta. Approximately 50 km will be located on non-contiguous
right of way (ROW). The proposed Project is located on private and Crown-ownecl lands. I
Temporary infrastructure, such as access roads, stockpile sites and contractor yards, will be
required during construction. Some new access roads will also be needed for pipeline
operations. The proposed pipeline will require a 10 m wide permanent ROW with an additional
width of 10 m of temporary workspace. The Proponent indicates that additional access roads
will be required for pipeline operations in areas of the Project where access is limited.
New electrical power lines and facilities will be required to operate the pump stations and valve
sites. Electrical power lines and facilities will be owned and operated by third-party power
providers.
The proposed Pipeline will cross the provincial boundary between Alberta and Saskatchewan at
a location 30 km south of Empress, Alberta and will cross the international border 75 km
southwest of Estevan, Saskatchewan.

2. COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATtONS
EC notes that surveys for migratory birds, Species at risk (including Burrowing Owl, Ferruginous
Hawk, Great Plains Toad, Northern Le0pard Frog, Ord's Kangaroo Rat, Piping Plover,
arthropods and ptants species at risk), wetiands, and invasive species, are yet to be compieted
by the Proponent. EC notes that the Proponent plans to submit this survey information as wet] 3
as mitigation options for wetland and wildlife issues as a further addendum to the EIS. ‘
EC requests the opportunity to review and comment on the ﬁnal comprehensive wildlife survey
repon‘ and proposed mitigation measures prior to the NEB hean'ng.
EC has reviewed the Environmental impact Statement (EIS) and supplemental! information
provided to date and has identified several major areas for concern, most notabty the routing of
the pipeline through sensitive areas with species at risk and wetland complexes.
2_.1, Migratory Birds
EC's mandate includes the protection of migratory birds and their habitat. Regulations pursuant
to the Migratory Birds Convention Act (MBCA) provide for the conservation of migratory birds
and the protection of their nests and eggs. Section 6 of the Regulations prohibits the
disturbance, destruction, or taking of a nest, egg or nest shelter of a migratory bird. Section 5.1 .
of the Migratory Birds Convention Act prohibits the deposition of substances harmful to
migratory birds in waters or areas frequented by migratory birds or in a place from which the
substance may enter such waters or such an area. .
This project traverses the Willow Bunch Big Muddy Valley Habitat subregion that contains
important Piping Plover, Ferruginous Hawk and Burrowing Owt breeding habitat, as well as
colonial waterbird concentration sites and waterfowl moulting and staging habitat (see Poston et
al., 1990); and the Bigstick Lake Sandhiils habitat subregion that contains important Ferruginous
Hawk, Burrowing Owl and colonial waterbird breeding habitat, as well as waterfowl breeding
and staging habitat (see Poston et al., 1990); and habitat for severai other migratory birds and
species at risk.
EC provides timing restrictions as general guidelines for industry to protect the great majority of
migratory birds while realizing the practicatities of development activities on the landscape.
However the onus remains with the Proponent to compiy with the legislation.
1. To minimize disturbance to breeding migratory birds in the Prairie and southern Parkland
ecozones of Saskatchewan and Alberta, in areas where migratory birds may be nesting,
Environment Canada recommends:
. habitat destruction activities (e.g., construction, mowing, vegetation clearing of any
sort, trenching, reclamation activities, etc.) avoid, at minimum, the period between
April 15 and July 31;
. if the Proponent has prior knowledge of an active nest, at any time during the year, it
must be protected with a suitable species appropriate buffer until the young have
ﬂedged;
- wetlands attractive to breeding migratory birds (e.g., those wetlands containing
water) should not be cieared/destroyed, at minimum, between Aprii 1 and August 31.
Canada Geese and Mallards may nest early and broods of waterfowi and waterbird
species are dependent upon wetlands throughout August and beyond;
_ 2 _

- raptors and upland game birds are provincialIy-mandated species and are not ‘
protected under the MBCA; therefore, the Proponent is advised to consuit provincial
wildlife authorities for appropriate buffers before consulting the Canadian Witdiife
Service.
Additional restrictions appiy in areas where species at risk may be present. a
Q Sgecies at Risk
The federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) is directed towards preventing wildlife species from
becoming extinct or lost from the wild, hetping in the recovery of species that are at risk as a
result of human activities, and promoting stewardship. The Act prohibits the kitting, harming or .
harassing of listed species; the damage and destruction of their residences; and the destruction '

During the 2010 and 2011 surveys to date, Barn Swallow, Bobolink, Burrowing Owl, Chestnut-
collared Longspur, Common Nighthawk, Ferruginous Hawk, Great Piains Toad, Horned Grebe,
Loggerhead Shrike, Long-billed Curlew, Monarch (butterfly), Northern Leopard Frog, Otive~sided
Ftycatcher, Short-eared Owl, and Sprague’s Pipit have been observed in the project area. In
addition, Swift Fox, Ord's Kangaroo Rat and Piping Plover have been previously observed in the
project area. The potential for Dusky Dune Moth, Gold-edged Gem, Greater Sage Grouse,
Mormon Metaimark, McCown‘s Longspur, Pale Yellow Dune Moth, Peregrine Falcon, Red-
headed Woodpecker, Sage Thrasher, Snapping Turtle, Whooping Crane and Yellow Rait was .
also noted (App J, Table J-2). EC notes that Alkaline Wing-nerved Moss may also be present in
the project area. E
With regards to species listed as Schedule ”I under SARA, EC reminds Responsibie Authorities
of their obligations under section 79(1) and 79(2) of SARA:
“Every person who is required by or under an Act of Parliament to ensure that an ;
assessment of the environmentat effects of a project is conducted must, without
delay, notify the competent minister or ministers in writing of the project if it is
likely to affect a listed witdlite Species or its criticai habitat.”
"The person must identify the adverse effects of the project on the listed wildlife
species and its critical habitat and, if the project is carried out, must ensure that
measures are taken to avoid or lessen those effects and to monitor them. The
measures must be taken in a way that is consistent with any applicable recovery
strategy and actions plans.”
EC is updating the timing restrictions and setbacks for species at risk and this information is
reﬂected in our commentary.
2. EC considers the project to have a high level of disturbance on the landscape and as
such Environment Canada recommends that the setbacks identified in Tabie 1 are to
be observed for species at risk that may be present in the project area.

2.2.1 Burrowing Owl
EC notes that, during the 2010 and 2011 surveys, an active Burrowing Ow! nest was found at
SE-10-013-24 W3M and the proposed ROW has been rerouted to approximately 750m from the
burrow. A Burrowing Owl nest was also found in this location during the Keystone XL surveys in
2008.
4. Environment Canada recommends that no project activity occur within 500m of the .
burrow at any time of the year, even if the nest is not active in 2012. Setbacks apply for :
24 months foltowing the test known date of occupation.
For the habituatly-used burrows and Burrowing Owls observed on and near the ROW in NE 11-
8-8 W3M in 2010, EC notes that the Proponent has rerouted the ROW to provide an ~200m
buffer. EC also notes that the Proponent plans to reassess the site in 2011 and the year of
construction in the event that construction starts later than 2011; maintain a 500m setback for 3
construction activities from April 1 to October 15, or until young have fledged and left the area; i
and conduct a post-construction survey in the season following construction to assess nesting
activity.
5. Due to the close proximity of the project to the burrows, Environment Canada .
recommends:
. artificial burrows be created in suttable habitat nearby; and
o the Proponent conducts a two-year post construction monitoring project to assess
nesting activity.
For the Burrowing Owls sighted at a burrow in NW 31-13-24 W3M in 2011 and for the burrow
with signs of a Burrowing Owl at SW 14-8-8 W3M, EC notes that these burrows were not active
nesting burrows in 2011.
6. Environment Canada recommends the Preponent assess these sites in 2012 prior to
any project activity, and implement the recommended 300m (roosting) - 500m (nesting)
setback if the burrows are active.
infrastructure that is visited on a regular basis should avoid these areas.
2.2.2 Ferruginous Hawk
During surveys to date, 30 Ferruginous Hawk nests were observed directly on the pipeline route
or within recommended setbacks. EC notes the Proponent’s plans to reconfirm nesting activity .
in the year of construction; maintain regulatory setback distance for construction activities '
between March 15 and July 15 and/or until the young have ﬂedged and left the area; restrict
operations activity between March 15 and July 15 at occupied nests; and conduct a post
construction survey in the season following construction to assess nesting activity (p. 307).
7. Environment Canada recommends:
0 construction and rectamation activities avoid the period between March 1 and July 15
within 1000m of active nests; .
. a buffer of 500m be employed from July 16 to February 28 for nests active that
summer; and
- 6 -

. the nests are protected from destruction year-round and infrastructure that is visited
on a reguiar basis should avoid these areas. ‘
EC notes that while there are other disturbances in the vicinity of the majority of nests, the :
effects may be cumulative.
8. If pipeline activity occurs within 250m of nests (only after July 15 and after the young
have ﬂedged and ieft the area), Environment Canada recommends the Proponent ;
. conduct a two-year post construction monitoring project in consultation with CW8;
and
0 provide mitigation in the form of artificiat nesting platforms erected in suitable habitat ‘
nearby. ;
2.2.3 Northern Leopard Frog/Great Plains T oad
Northern Leopard Frogs were observed at 50 tocations to date, 31 of which are traversed by the '
pipeline, and 19 are nearby. Great Plains Toads were observed at ten locations traversed by
the pipeline to date, with an additional three locations in close proximity to the pipeline. Many of
the sites traversed by the pipeline are capable of providing breeding and overwintering habitat
for these species. EC notes that the Proponent had previously indicated that Northern Leopard
Frog breeding areas would not be traversed and that, due to the pipeline size, in most cases,
the pipeline would be routed to avoid wetlands (Vantage Response to the NEB Information
Request No. 3. (A29664), document 814-12 - Attachment 3.16(b-2) A127U7), however no ;
similar commitments have been made in the EIS documents provided. ;
9. Environment Canada recommends:
. Northern Leopard Frog and Great Plains Toad wintering sites and breeding ponds
are protected year—round with a 400m setback;
. the Pipeline specifically avoid wettands where Northern Leopard Frog and Great ;
Plains Toad are present, and that the ROW nearby be frog/toad-proofed and 2
monitored and construction and traffic restricted;
0 pump stations and other infrastructure that are to be visited on a regular basis (e.g.
pigging stations, cathodic protection beds) atso avoid areas with Northern Leopard
Frogs and Great Plains Toads; where wetlands that do not provide wintering or
breeding habitat cannot be avoided, frogs/toads should be relocated to suitabte
wetlands nearby using sterile handling techniques under permit from provincial
wildlife authorities.
2.2.4 Ord's Kangaroo Rat
EC notes that the Ord’s Kangaroo Rat surveys are not yet complete.
10. EC recommends:
o a year-round 500m setback from active burrows; and
o infrastructure visited on a regular basis avoid areas with Ord’s Kangaroo Rat, and no
night-time construction or lighted activities occur in these areas.

Dear MS. Erickson:
Vantage Pipeline Project
Hearing Order 03-34011
File OF-Fac'Oil-VMO-ZOI 0-01 02
This Letter of Comment is subrhitted regarding the proposed Vantage Pipeline
Canada Inc. Vantage Pipeline Project (Hearing Order 01-13-2011, File OP-Fae-Oil—
V040-2010~01 02). Saskatchewan Ministty of Environment (“the Ministry”)
appreciates the oppommity to participate in the National Energy Board’s (“the
Board’s”) review process and to comment on this project.
We recognize that the comment period for this heating has closed, but as the Ministry
was inadvertently missed in the notiﬁm’a'on process, we only became aware that the
BSA was available for comment at the beginning of October. We shortened our usual
review time in order to provide the advice contained in this letter prior to the
November 1, 2011 hearing date.
The comments which follow are based on review of the Environmental and Socio-
Economic Assessment (Februaw 2011) (“the ESA”) presented by Vantage Pipeline
Canada Inc. (“Vantage," “the proponent") in support of their Vantage Pipeline
Project (“the Project”). The comments, which are limited to the Saskatchewan
portion of the Project, are based on review of the ESA by the Ministry, which is the
principal environmental pmtecﬁon agency in Saskatchewan, and the Saskatchewan
Environmental Review Panel (“SEARP”). SEARP is composed of the province’s
line Ministries and relevant Agencies. Saskatchewan’s interest in the Project is
based on the scope of the pmject in the province (573.8 km) and the number and
Signiﬁcance of environm-tal issues raised by the Project.

Saskatchewan is pleased with Vantage’s co-operative approach in planning the

Project and in responding to concems raised by provincial agencies. We welcome

and encourage Vantage’s continuing consultation with provincial agencies as

iject details are ﬁnalized. Your principal contacts for land and resource

management issues are:

- with Environment for wildlife and other resource-management issues: Ken
Dillabaugh, Senior Ecological Pmtection Specialist, Lands Branch1 Swift
Cuaent, phone: 306-7 78-8260;

I with Saskatchewan Watershed Authority (SWA) for surface, drainage and
ground water issues: Nolan Shaheen in Moose J aw (3 06-694—3963) or Gord
Hagen in Swift Current (306-778v8266) and Dwayne Siba in Weybum (306-848-
23 55); and

'- with Agriculnne on Saskatchewan Crown lands: Lorne Veitch, Regional
Manager, Crown Land Services, Lands Branch, Swift Current, phone: 306-778-

8300.
As a general comment, reviewers found the infomation provided in the ESA,
including planned mitigation, to be comprehensive and detailed. Vantage and their
consultants are to be commended on the quality of the data and analysis supporting
the ESA. However, several reviewers noted that the organization of the ESA,
including the many update documents, made it very difﬁcult to ﬁnd information.
Within Saskatchewan, the Project will transverse extensive areas of sensitive native
grasslands, rare Species habitat and numerous wetlands and streams. The Minisuy
has identiﬁed a number of issues on which we wish to provide advice or to
recommend additional consideration on the part of Vantage and/or the Board. Some
of these points pertain to provincial regulatory requirements while others pertain to
more general issues and outstanding concerns.

]. Remnant tracks of native vegetation are an important part of Saskatchewan‘s
natural heritage and play a vital role in ensuﬁng the protection of biodiversity,
including the promotion of gene pools for the mums, as well as providing
critical habitat for both native plant and wildlife species. The remaining tracts
of native prairie are also economically important to local agricultural practices,
which rely on these areas to provide valuable grazing habitat for livestock.
Additionally, the presence of natma] areas helps to buffer against large scale
soil erosion, and provides a source of pollinating insect speeia and predators of
crOp pests. The proponent does a good job of pointing out the value of our
remaining native prairie (limited as it is) and merefore every effort should be
made to avoid native prairie.

2. Species of coneem have been identiﬁed within the vicinity of the pipeline.

a. Vantage's general goal is to observe Saskatchewan‘s recmnmended restricted
activity dates and setback distances. If avoidance is net feasible Vantage will
resmvey these locations prior to program commencement and recommend
site speciﬁc mitigation or best management practises. Proposed
commencement of this program is August 1, 2012. The Ministry will require
commencement to be after August 15 in locations where pOpulations of bird
species at risk have been identiﬁed to ensure nesting and ﬂedging is not
impacted. Ord's Kangaroo rat has been identiﬁed within 20 meters of ROW
in the NW 9-14-25 W3M. Vantage will resurvey this location and determine
if rerouting is feasible. The Minisuy will concluCt sight inspections on
locations where occurrences of species of concern are considered to be
excessively close to the working area of the pipeline to evaluate Vamages
speciﬁc mitigation measures.

b. As recommended in the ESA, any areas that were not surveyed according to
SKCDC criteria for rare plants (i.e., some early and mid-late season were
missed) should be resurveyed prior to construction in 2012 and miti gation/re-
routes planned accordingly- An environmental monitor with a stong
knowledge of SivSB plants and listed wildlife species should be on site
during construction and prepared to provide direction on mitigation.

c. In the July 25 Update (T able 5.] , p 56) the Regulatory Guideline for the

Burrow with Burrowing Owl sign was listed as N/A, and it is stated on page
60 that then: are no government setbacks or timing resuictions for Black
Tern. This informaticm is provided in the Saskatchewan Conservation Data
Centre Activity Restriction Guidelines-

(1. Table 13—5 identiﬁes plant species of concern or provincially tracked species.
There is no speciﬁc reference to population numbers for each occurrence. In
particular, for SI and 82 plants population numbers will partially determine
what mitigation will be suitable If the pepulation is locally abundant outside
the ROW mitigation may be more ﬂexible versus a population of 1-2 plants
within the ROW. Vantage has proposed transplanting certain species, but has
not indicated how successful this procedure is expected to be. Vantage will
be required to conduct two years of rare plant surveys after the program is
concluded to assess success of the transplantation program. This information
should be submitted to Ken Diilabaugh, Senior Ecological Protection

Specialist, Lands Branch, Swift Current, phone: 306-778-8260.

3. Vantage has identiﬁed several noxious weeds along the pipeline ROW.
Vantage will be required to set up wash stations along the ROW where
equipment has passed through noxious weed populations. Equipment will be
washed to minimize potential transfer of seeds and rhizomes from these plants-

4. Proposed disruption to several hundred wetlands prompts a general comment of
concern from Saskatchewan. A paramount goal and challenge is to conserve

remaining biodiversity in a landscape subject to increasing development
pressures. The potential to further minimize or avoid wetland habitat
disturbance should be examined.

5. A number of stream crossings are identiﬁed in Saskatchewan over the preposed
pipeline route, which will be addressed dun'ngfederal and provincial permitting
processes. However, special consideration should be given to the risks
involved in crossings being proposed for headwater stream reaches. Among
these, certain spring fed creeks in the Cypress Hills area are provincially
recognized as blue ribbon trout ﬁsheriw - unique in a Saskatchewan context,
and not without national recognition- If crossings must be made in such

systems than Operational risks to downstream reaches from pipeline failure
would be reduced if crossings were situated as low down the drainage system
as possible- T echnical practice and routing considerations to mitigate risk
factors for hi gh value locations needs ﬁn'ther discussion during the permitting
process.

6. The preponent is likely already aware, but prior to conducting scream crossings,
an Aquatic Habitat Protection Permit will be required. They should contact the
Ecological Lands Specialists in Swift Current for this permit.

7. Vantage has stated that tilled or class 1,11 and III wetlands will be assessed for
open cut viability- Vantage will be required to assess these wetlands ptior to
the program Starting and identify speciﬁcally which wetlands Vantage is
prOposing to open cut. Concerns around the open cut techniques includes
scheduling of the program to ensure there are not any impacts on nesting birds
or amphibians and to minimize habitat impacts to the wetland. Depending on
size of Class III wetlands, Vantage may be required to traverse these wetlands
by trenchless methods. Horizontal directional drilling (HDD) has been
preposed however no detail with regards to how the HDD would be conducted

has been provided. More infannation will be required from Vantage prior to
permitting.

8. Table 10—2 examines the enviromnental effects of the project. The table
indicates that during pipeline construction there could be localized alteration of
ground water rechargeldiseharge pattems and attributes a low rating to this.

For the most part this may be a reasonable statement, but it is possible the
pipeline could intersect a shallow anesian aquifer, especially in valleys and
stream crossings, potentially resulting in signiﬁcant ground water ﬂows. Also,
we would reiterate that while impacts from smaller scale localized alteration of
ground water recharge/discharge patterns may not be regionally signiﬁcant, the
impacts could be signiﬁcant locally. For example, the disruption of a spring
used by an individual for stock waten‘ng. We would suggest that in these
situations miti gati on may be necasary.

9- Springs are a component of the ground water system which could potentially be
affected by the ptoj ect. However, the discussion on springs is very brief and
indicates that no springs have been officially documented in the regional study
area. We would like to point out that there is no mechanism we are aware of for
"ofﬁcially“ noting the presence of springs in the province. However, we do feel
it is highly likely that this pipeline will intersect a number of springs/shallow
aquifers. While individual springs may not be of regional signiﬁcance, they can
be of great signiﬁcance to an individual land owner and appmpriate mitigation
should be employed when encountering springs.

10. During the construction process, surface water drainage patterns should be
maintained under natural conditions- If the natural drainage patterns are
impeded or enhanced, approval from SWA muSt be granted ﬁrst.

11. In Table 10-2, we question how the impact on ground water resources for a
hazardous material spill could be rated as low, meaning no mitigation would be
required even if a shallow aquifer is present. Consequently, the pr0ponent must
undertake all reasonable precauti ons against spills during construction and it
would seem reasonable that, depending on the type of spill, mitigation may be
required-

12. It would appear from the plan that the proposed pipeline parallels the exisring
Foothills Pipeline and existing road right-of-ways. However, from the general
plan it is difﬁcult to list any Water Right proj ects that may be impacted by the
proposal. Individual Water Right projects licenced by SWA are privately

owned, therefore we recommend that Vantage Pipeline Canada directly contact
landowners to address any concerns they may have prior to the start of
construction.

13. As a point of clariﬁcation we would like to note that the documentation of
water wells within a three kilometre buffer along the pipeline right of way is
based on the Saskatchewan's Drillers Log Database, which consists of Water
Well Driller's Reports submitted by drillers to SWA. This database is not
comprehensive and not all water wells may necessan‘ly be contained within the
data base.

14. Pursuant to The Saskatchewan Watershed Authorio: Act, 2005, any water that is
used for industrial purposes requires a Tenn Water Rights Licence. If this
proposal will require water for pressure testing the pipeline, the pmponent must

15. No concerns were identiﬁed with respea to soils as long as best management
practices, as descrfbed in the proposal, are employed and there is continual
monitoring and remedial actions for any accidents, malfunctions and unplanned
events during construction and Operation of the project.

16. There were no general concerns identiﬁed regarding dn'nking water, waStewater
(sewage) or solid waste managanmt. Controls for spill prevention and waste
management as a means to protect sunface and groundwater source water
supplia appear adequate- Reliance on local community motels/hotels for staff
housing alleviates the typw of concerns that often arise when conStmction
camps are used.

Please contact Ann Riemer of this ofﬁce (306-787-5793) with any questions

regarding the foregoing.

Dear Ms. Erickson:
Re: Environment Canada’s Comment on the NEB letter and Draft
Environmental Screening Report: OH-3-2011 - Vantage Pipeline Canada Inc.
(A37019)
In our Letter of comments Submitted August 19,2011, Environment Canada
(EC) requested an opportunity to comment on the screening report for this
project. EC has reviewed the NEB Draft Environmental Screening Report_and _
provides the following comments:
EC generally supports the views and recommendations of the Board related to
native prairie, rare plants, invasive species, wetlands, wildlife and wildlife habitat
protection, the environmental protection plan, and the post-construction
environmental monitoring plan.
EC suggests the following clarifications and edits and offers the following
comments on the draft ESR:
2) 8.3.2.2. Vegetation %
a) Native Prairie Vegetation and Associated Communities,
Canada www.ec.gc.ca - 3 -

Views of the Board (p. 27)
i. Second paragraph: ‘
EC requests the opportunity to review the Native Prairie Protection
Plan and Monitoring Program, and the Native Prairie Monitoring ?
Report :
b) Rare Plants (p. 28)
i. Mitigation Measures, Last line: ;
After “for the Prairies.” add “EC recommends avoidance."
c) Noxious Weeds and Invasive Non-native Species (p. 29)
i. Mitigation Measures:
Add “EC recommended that weed mowing and other habitat
destruction activities avoid at minimum the key breeding period for
Migratory Birds in the project area (April 15 — July 31). In areas
where Sprague’s Pipit and other Migratory Bird Species at Risk
may be nesting, EC recommended that this period should be
extended to August 31 ”
ii. Views of the Board:
At the end of the second sentence, suggestion to adding ”or j
impacting nesting migratory birds.”
3) 8.3.2.4 Wetlands (p. 32) .
a) Mitigation Measures:
Add “EC recommended that Vantage avoid wetlands that provide breeding
and overwintering habitat to SARA-Iisted Great Plains Toads and Northern
Leopard Frogs.”
4) 8.3.2.5. Wildlife and Wildlife Habitat Protection (p. 34)
a) Mitigation Measures, Setbacks and timing restrictions for listed species
and Sgecies of SQeciaI Status
i. 4th paragraph, first sentence:
EC notes the discrepancy between the text here “”Vantage
indicated that ...due to pipeline size, in most cases the pipeline
would be routed to avoid wetlands” and the text on p. 7 in the first
bullet under “Wetlands”: “A total of 313 wetlands are traversed by -
the project”. While Vantage had verbally indicated the former to
EC during a meeting, the latter does not support thts.
