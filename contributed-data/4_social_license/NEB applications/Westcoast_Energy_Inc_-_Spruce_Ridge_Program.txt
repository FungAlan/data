 5.     The potential environmental and socio-economic effects of the Project, including any cummulatove

This submission is to request an opportunity for Northern Health to be able to participate as a commenter in
the National Energy Board (NEB)’ s review of the Spruce Ridge Program application. We feel that we are
likely to have relevant information and expertise that may be of interest to the decision makers. As well, our
health services and the health of the population that we serve may be directly impacted.
Northern Health provides health care services to approximately 300,000 people in Northern British Columbia
and is the main health service provider in Chetwynd, Hudson's Hope and Fort St. John (locations of the
closest health services to the project). Rural health care delivery is complex and fragile. Any additional
demands to this system, including demand that may arise from temporary workforces, must be carefully
managed and minimized as to not overwhelm the system. Given the proposed workforce associated with this
project, there is a likelihood that this project will impact health care services (including non-urgent care and
emergency care services) in the area and we therefore ask that we can bring forward our concerns and best
practices in this regard, many of which are summarized on our website .
Relatedly, under the Public Health Act, we have a responsibility to protect the health of the public. We know
that projects, such as the Spruce Ridge Program, have the ability to negatively (or positively) impact
numerous socio-economic and environmental determinants of health, including those that can result from
spills, accidents or malfunctions. On this front, we would also like to bring forward our concerns and
recommend best practices.
Based on the above, we expect that the following issues from the List of Issues are of relevance to Northern
Health:
- The potential environmental and socio-economic effects of the Project;
- Contingency planning for spills, accidents or malfunctions
- Safety and security during construction and operation of the project, including emergency response
planning and third –party damage prevention
- The terms and conditions to be included in any recommendations or approval the Board may issue
We look forward to supporting the NEB for this and future projects as part of our commitment, statutory and
ethical obligation to build and strengthen the health of the people we serve in Northern British Columbia. If
you have any questions, concerns or need additional clarity, please contact the Office of Health and Resource
Development (contact information enclosed).

Re: Hearing Order GH-001-2018 and File OF-Fac-Gas-W102-2017-11 01 - Spruce
Ridge Program NEB Letter of Comment Submission On Behalf of Northern Health
Thank you for the opportunity to participate as a Commenter in the technical review of
the Spruce Ridge Program NEB Application, dated October 19, 2017.
In concordance with Northern Health’s commitment, statutory and ethical obligation to
build and strengthen the health of the people we serve in Northern British Columbia,
please see our enclosed comments and see Standard Working Group Comments and
Recommendations for Provincial Environmental Assessments in Northern British
Columbia1 (our Standard Comments document). While this document was designed to
support the Provincial Environmental Assessment process, we feel that the majority of
our comments contained in this document are also applicable to the NEB process for
the Spruce Ridge Program.
The World Health Organization’s definition of health states that “health is a state of
complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease
or infirmity2”. In line with this definition, Northern Health is fully committed to ensuring
the preservation of the dignity (physical, social and mental health and wellness) of our
people and the protection of their built and natural environments (services and
infrastructure, land, air and water). Our comments contained herein are a reflection of
this commitment, and pertain to the following topics from the List of Issues that were
identified in our Application to Participate:
      The potential environmental and socio-economic effects of the Project, including
          any cumulative environmental effects that are likely to result from the Project,
          including those required to be considered by the National Energy Board's Filing
          Manual.

Conference, New York, 19-22 June, 1946; signed on 22 July 1946 by the representatives of 61 States
(Official Records of the World Health Organization, no. 2, p. 100) and entered into force on 7 April 1948.
          The terms and conditions to be included in any approval the Board may issue.
         Contingency planning for spills, accidents or malfunctions, during construction
          and operation of the Project.
         Safety and security during construction of the Project and operation of the
          Project, including emergency response planning and third-party damage
          prevention.
In addition to those indicated in our Standard Comments document and in our Health
and Medical Services Plan Best Management Guide For Industrial Camps 3, key issues
pertaining to socio-economic and health impacts throughout the various stages of the
project have been highlighted below. Please note that Northern Health’s review was
limited to those sections related to social and cultural well-being, infrastructure and
services, and accidents and malfunctions.
Comment #1: Social and Cultural Well-being
We disagree that potential, residual and cumulative effects to Social and Cultural Well-
being can be “considered negligible” (as was indicated in Appendix 1 Project
Interactions Table4).
Based on our experience with extensive resource development activities occurring
across Northern BC, as well as our recent research and evidence gathering in this
area5, 6, we expect that there will be cumulative adverse effects to community health
(e.g. increased housing and living costs, communicable disease, crime, substance use
and mental health issues, pressures on services, etc.), particularly to vulnerable
populations. We understand that recently Chetwynd has experienced rapid fluctuations
in living and housing costs due to the influx of transient workers associated with various
projects, and therefore we recommend that Westcoast Energy carefully manages any
impacts to housing affordability/availability; this will enhance their proposed worker
lodging plan and stakeholder engagement plan.

 Please see our Standard Comments document7 for more information. At this point in the
assessment process, we recommend that mitigation strategies and an adaptive
management approach be developed to minimize, monitor and address these potential
impacts as we expect that these cumulative impacts are more complicated and
extensive than identified in the application.
Accordingly, we ask that a commitment is made to monitoring for and managing these
effects, and we ask that this be included in a Social and Economic Effects Management
Plan (if supported by local communities and First Nations groups) that is scaled
appropriately for the Project. We note that this has been included as a Condition for a
number of recently certified projects in Northern BC, and through this mechanism
partners have been able to find practical, collaborative solutions to protect the health of
communities.
Comment #2: Infrastructure and Services
In Appendix 1 - Project Interactions Table8 it is identified that “the Project’s construction
workforce may increase demand for health, emergency, and policing services” and that
mitigations will include “an Emergency Response Plan”, “emergency first aid onsite”, a
“construction safety program”, awareness of Work Safe BC Regulations/Guidelines, and
a “Fit for Duty policy”. However, there is no mention regarding planning for impacts to
local health services in the context of non-urgent care needs.
While much of the WorkSafe BC legislation is geared to managing occupational injuries
in a first aid scenario, our experience tells us that a majority (as much as 90%) of health
care demands from temporary workforces arise from non-occupational, non-urgent
injuries and illnesses. Based on our understanding and experience, it is likely that
temporary workers (including those residing in local communities) will access non-
urgent care services in places like emergency rooms that are not designed for this
purpose. We stress that health services in the region are often operating near or at
capacity. Further, Northern Health’s funding allocation is based primarily on the resident
population; baseline primary care services available to the temporary workforce can be
assumed to be zero. Any increases in health services demand associated with the non-
resident workforce will not be within the health services capacity. Please see Section 7
of our Standard Comments document9.
Accordingly, it is our expectation that companies meet the primary and preventative
care needs of their temporary workforces, including non-urgent medical needs not

 related to emergencies or occupational injuries as well as infection/outbreak
management and health promotion and prevention. Therefore, we request that the
Proponent develops a Health and Medical Services Plan (as per our guidance
document10 and appropriate to the scale of the project) that can be reviewed by
Northern Health. While the HMSP Guide was developed primarily for industrial camps,
the information contained within this Guide applies to all temporary workforces and can
be scaled/adapted to minimize impacts to health services from workforces residing in
the community. Other pipeline projects in the area have committed to developing a
HMSP, despite housing workers in communities (e.g. NEBC Expansion Project). The
fragility of the health care system in the region should be recognized, and any impacts
to health services should be carefully managed.
Comment #3: Accidents/Malfunctions
We appreciate the proposed mitigations relating to potentials for “drilling fluid release”,
“pipeline leaks or ruptures”, “fire”, “hazardous materials spills”, and “vehicle accidents”
(as identified in Appendix 1 - Project Interactions Table). However, we advise that the
following commitments are included as mitigations in the event of a pipeline rupture or
hazardous spill:
    -    In order to ensure that water users are notified in a timely manner of possible
         contamination, it is advisable that an effective communication strategy is
         established so that potential water users may be forewarned of any impending
         contamination issues. Also we advise that this includes an inventory of all water
         users that may be impacted (including drinking water and recreational users).
    -    For major accident scenarios, we ask that a commitment be included for the
         Proponent to fund appropriate health risk characterization and health impact
         studies (as determined by EAO and Northern Health) so that appropriate risk
         communication, health advisories and mitigations can be implemented. These
         should be carried out by qualified and third party professionals with expertise in
         this area. Northern Health would not be in the position to carry out these studies
         in the event of an incident. A number of leading practices and learnings have
         emerged recently based on experiences with recent major spills in BC, and we
         see this as a very important consideration that was not reflected in the
         Application. The social and economic costs of major spills can be substantial,
         and responsible persons, communities and stakeholders would all benefit from
         having a robust and proactive health assessment process for major spills.
Please ensure that, within proposed management plans, Public Health is contacted
(Health Emergency Management BC (HEMBC) and/or public health) in the event of any
accident or malfunction that has the potential to impact the health of the public. Please

 find more information regarding Northern Health Emergency Roles and
Responsibilities11 on the Office of Health and Resource Development web page. Note
that contacting HEMBC would ensure the appropriate contacts and departments at NH
are notified and should be considered the single-point of contact during an emergency
event.
Northern Health looks forward to further collaboration with Westcoast Energy
Inc./Spectra Energy Transmission to better serve our people impacted by industrial
projects. If you have any questions, concerns or need additional clarity, please contact
the Office of Health and Resource Development.
