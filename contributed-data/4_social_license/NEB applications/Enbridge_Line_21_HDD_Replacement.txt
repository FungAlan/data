Dear Madam:

Re: Enbridge Pigelines {NW} Inc. — Line 21 Segment Reglacement Proiect

We, The Mayor and Council of the Town of Norman Wells, wish to express our support for the Line 21
Segment Replacement Project. Starting early 2017, Enbridge has engaged us regarding this project,
including: the rationale for the Project, the details of the proposed pipeline segment replacement and
decommissioning, the regulatory applications required, and how to raise concerns and issues.

Our reasons for support are as follows:

The operations of the Imperial Oil field are integral to the economic health and viability of the
Community and as such, any unexpected, prolonged interruption to this will have drastic consequences
for the Town.

Given the recent downturn in exploration, the uncertainty surrounding the future of the Oilﬁeld
Production Operations here is making it difﬁcult for us to promote an optimistic and positive
atmosphere conducive to economic development.
Thank—you for the opp rtunity to submit our letter of support.
Sincerely, I .‘l ! 9 :_ I .3

Re: A82026 Enbridge Pipelines Inc. - Line 21 Segment Replacement Project - Section 58
and Section 45.1 Applications
Dear Ms. Young,
Imperial Oil Limited ("Imperial") supports Enbridge Pipelines lnc.'s ("Enbridge") application
currently before the board on the Line 21 Segment Replacement Project and decommissioning.
Enbridge Line 21 is the only available transportation option for oil produced at Imperial’s
Norman Wells operation. As a result of the closure of Line 21, Imperial has safely ceased
production at Norman Wells. A restart ef the operation is dependent on a pipeline repair being
approved and successfully executed.
Due to the limited construction season in the North. timely approval of the application is required
to minimize impact to Imperial’s operations. contractors and the community of Norman Wells.
The Norman Wells operation is a signiﬁcant economic contributor to the local community,
providing both direct and indirect beneﬁts. For example, about 60 Imperial employees and 50
contractors are involved in normal day—to-day operations. In addition, the operation generates
electricity for its own use and excess generation is sold to the Northwest Territories Power
Corporation. which supplies the town of Norman Wells.
We request that the National Energy Board consider this written submission during its
deliberations.
Sincerely.
Rich Kruger
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer

RE: Hearing Order MHOO1-2017
Dear Ms. Sheri Young/
Following the announcement of a one-year delay in the project schedule, the Norman
Wells Land Corporation is providing an additional letter of support for the following
reasons:
As a direct result of a one-year delay, the Norman Wells Land Corporation's wholly
owned and operated subsidiary - the Norman Wells CIaimant Corporation, had to
immediately lay off sixty.percent (60%) of its workforce at the Norman Wells Proven
^Tea.
This not only adversely imf)act the Norman Wells Land Corporation's ability to deliver
social programs that benefit community members in Town of Norman Wells, through
utilizing profits generated by the Norman Wells Claimant Corporation, but also
adversely impact families of our former employees from other Sahtu communities that
depends on their eamings.
And;
The Norman Wells Land Corporation firmly believe that the delay of the project will also
adversely impact the local economy of Norman Wells, as well as other communities in
the sahtu, given that Imperial Oil Limited/s operation has been, and still is, the single
biggest economic and employment driver in the Sahtu.
 Therefore, delays of this nature, given the proposed scope of the project, is
unwarranted; and the Norman Wells land Corporation is hereby reaffirming its support
of the project.

Re: Support for Enbridge Line 21 Segment Replacement
 Tulita Land and Financial Corporation in there Board Meeting have
 Supported the Replacement of line 21 on the Enbridge Pipeline.
 We feel that Enbridge should be replacing the pipelines to make sure
 The environment will be safe.
 We feel with the bank erosion that could be a risk to the pipeline, we feel that there
 should be a replacement done to protect the Environment and the waters.
Thank you for taking our commehts for your consideration for the project.

have stayed in Fort Simpson since then and have brought business to Fort Simpson,s hotels, restaurants

Enbridge has told us that it will try to use local resources as much as possible for this project. Enbridge
provided us with a preliminary list of required services that can be sourced locally. This list includes:
    .    Helicopters                                            .  TruckRentals
    I    Watertaxi                                              .  CampSupport
    .    Barging                                                ®   Gravel
