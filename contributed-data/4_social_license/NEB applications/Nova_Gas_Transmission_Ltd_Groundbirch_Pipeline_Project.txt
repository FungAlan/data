                                                                           -

                                                   LETTER OF COMMENT
          Environment Canada (EG) has completed Its review of the AppIiction for a Certificate of Public
          Convenience and Necessity (the Application) dated April 30, 2009, Additional Written Evidence
          dated July 27, 2009, ard Nova Gas responses to the information requests for the above noted
          Project. EC has identified three areas in which the documentation provides inadequate or
          incomplete information that will need to be redressed before EC can provide additional specialist
          or expert information or knowledge or the proposal as pe subsection 12(3) of the Canadian
          Environmcnta/ Assessment Act (CEAA). Further, participation and provision of commentary at
          this time is not a constraint or fetter on EC in fulfilling its statutory responsibilities undar the CEAA,
          and under the Department’s mandate as defined through specific statutes and regulations
          assi9ned to the Minister of the Environment.
          EC is providing this Letter of Comment with respect to the environmental assessment and the
          effectiveness to mitigate the environmental effects of the Project on species at risk, migratory
          birds and wetlands. C appreciates the opportunity to provide commentary and recommendations
          on this matter.
          1. SPECIES AT RISK
         The Species at Risk Act (SARA) establishes obligations to address potential effects on listed
         wildlife species in      federal environmental assessment. Amendments to CAA reinforce these
         obligations. These obligations apply to species that are listed under Schedule 1 of SARA. The
         SARA amends the definition of envirormental effect” under GEM Such that environmental
         assessments are required to address the potential effects of a proposed project on listed wildlife
         species, their critical habitat, and residences of ndivilLIala of those species, and to consider any
         cumulative enviroflniefltl effects.
         Environmental assessments should also include species that are nut legally listed under SARA,
         riamly thoo species that are recQmmended for leaI Iistin         0 by the CommIttee on the Sttu of
         Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEW1C). This approach is in keeping with Canada’s
         commitments under zbe Convention on Biologkal DiversHy and the Accord for the Protection of
         Species at Risk between the federal government and provinces and territories.
         SARA also confers obligations on a responsible authority, beyond the requirements of CAA to
         notify the competent minister if a project is ikely to affect a listed wHdlife species or its crilicai

         BC acknowledges Nova Gas is undertaking dditinral survey work and intends to file
         supplemenLal reports in 2009. In light of the two surveys that were conducted September 15-18
         arid December 2-3, 2008, and additional field surveys and supplemental information yet to be
         filed, and hence uncertainties about the potential effects of the proposed project on species listed
         on Schedule 1 of SARA and the identification of potential site specific mitigation measures to be
         taken to avoid or lessen those effects, EC cannot at this time support the conclusion by NOVA
         Gas as stated in the Application EnvThonmentai and Socio-ffconoriilc page 14 that “taking into
         consideration mitigation measures, the residual Project effects on species at risk were determined
         to be not significant.”
         Recommendations:
         C-1       C recommends the proposed supplemental reports identify all species listed on
                   Schedule 1 of SARA and those raconlzed as “at risk” by COSEWIG that may occur
                   in the project area, using reco9nIzed survey protocols and appropriately timed
                   surveys to provide currant field data.
         EC-2. EQ recommends the proponent describe the potential effects of the proposed
                   project on species listed on Schedule 1 of SARA and those recognIzed as “at risk”
                   by COSEWIC, their critical habitat, and residences of individuals of those species
                   and discuss measures taken to avoid or lessen thos& effects.
