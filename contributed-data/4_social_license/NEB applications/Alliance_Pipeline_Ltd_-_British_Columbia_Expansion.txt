Dear Mr. Yeimg:
Re: Alliance Pipeline Ltd. ("Alliance")
February 28, 2007 Application for B.C. Expansion
Board File: OF~Fac~Gas~A159~2007~01 01
We are counsel to PPM Energy Canada Ltd. ("PPM"). While PPM did not formally participate
in this proceeding pursuant to the Board's procedural letter of April 13, 2007, it has reviewed the
application, evidence and responses to Information Requests.
This letter is ﬁled as a Letter of Comment as contemplated by Section .30 of the Board‘s Rules of
Practice and Procedure. It is true that the Board did not issue a hearing order in this case (and
thus no date is Speciﬁed for ﬁling a Letter of Comment); nor did the Board's procedural letter
address Letters of Comment” Nonetheless, in PPM's view, its ﬁling of this letter is consistent
with the spirit of' the Rules. PPM ﬁles the letter at this time to afford others an opportunity to
respond to it should they choose to do so.
PPM is supportive of this Application and urges the Board to approve it in its entirety.
PPM is currently a ﬁrm shipper on Alliance and, as of November 1, 2008, will hold l66 nimcf/d
of ﬁrm service entitlement PPM has entered into a binding subscription supporting this
expansion - it was one of the two parties which ultimately executed a contract for incremental
TAC receipt capacity, as described in the Application in the Open season.
In PPM's view the expansion project, including the ROS Secondary Receipt Service, will provide
PPM, and a1] shippers, with increased market liquidity relative to their natural gas production in

northeastern BiCi, through the provision of increased receipt capacity onto Alliance in this
region.
As discussed by the Applicant in its responses to NEB LRi's 2.2 and 2.4, the ROS Secondary
Receipt Service (and associated toll) are integral parts of the expansion project
While perhaps not developed in the conventional way, the ROS Secondary Receipt Service
offers a sound, nondiscriminatory response to the underlying issue -— namely, a reasonable
opportunity for parties taking up incremental TAC receipt capacity to optimize their contractual
commitments, and to mitigate costs during periods when a shipper is unable to ﬁlliy utilize its
service In this sense, it is a regulatory incentive to the development of a secondary market for
the incremental subscribed TAC capacity. This capacity, coupled With the additional capacity of
20 mmef/d described in the Preliminary Comment portion of the response to NEB LR. 2.4, both
created by the eXpansion, provide beneﬁts to all shippers.
It appears to PPM that to a considerable degree opposition to this application (see CAPP
Evidence) is process-driven and rooted in historical anaehronism The process, and the ROS,
evolved, as described by Alliance, The expansion, including ROS, is responsive to a need for
incremental TAC receipt capacity, and provides the associated beneﬁts described. PPM urges
the Board to view this application in its broader context, and to approve it.
Yours truly,
Gowwvmsvn HENDERSON LL?

Dear Mr. Young:
Re:     Alliance Pipeline Ltd. (Alliance)
        28 February 2007 Application for the British Columbia Expansion
        File OF-Fac-Gas A159-2007-01 01
Canadian Natural Resources (CNR) is filing a Letter of Comment as it is CNR’s understanding
that other parties who have not formally participated in this proceeding have already submitted
comments.
CNR is a major producer of natural gas in Western Canada and currently holds 60.5 Mmcf/d of
firm service under long term commitments on the Alliance pipeline system.
Alliance Pipelines tries to make the case in its Final Argument that CAPP does not represent
shippers on the Alliance system but that CAPP’s participation may be motivated by interests that
are contrary to the interests of the Alliance Shippers. CNR is a significant Alliance shipper and
was actively involved in the determination of CAPP’s position on this issue and strongly
supports the CAPP position presented in these proceedings.
CNR encourages Alliance to work with its shippers and resolve issues in a collaborative process.
