Dear Chief Willson,
This letter is in reference to the manner in which the Crown’s duty to consult will be
exercised for NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd’s (NGTL) proposed Horn River pipeline
project. By way of further background, you will recall that the NEB contacted you by
letter dated J uly, 2009 to discuss the federal review process for the proposed Horn River
Mainline pipeline proj ect. The proj ect will be subj ect to a Screening-level environmental
assessment (EA) review under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act and the
federal Major Projects Management Ofﬁce (MPMO) process.
The Crown will rely on the National Energy Board (NEB) process, to the extent possible,
to discharge any Crown duty to consult Aboriginal groups for the Horn River Mainline
pipeline project. The following general steps outlined below will be followed by the
Crown as the primary means to identify, consider and address the potential adverse
impacts of the proposed project on potential or established Aboriginal or treaty rights.
As the proponent of the project, NGTL is required to engage and consult potentially
affected Aboriginal groups both prior to, and aﬁer, the ﬁling of a Proj ect Description and
a Project Application with the NEB. The purpose of this consultation is to explain the
proposed project to Aboriginal groups and provide these groups with the opportunity to
raise any initial concerns about the project directly with the proponent. Proponents are
also required by NEB procedures to provide information to the NEB and relevant federal
departments on the nature of the concerns raised by Aboriginal groups and their efforts to
address them through proj ect design and mitigation measures.
NGTL submitted the Application for the project to the NEB on February 19, 2010.
Following receipt of the Application, the NEB will provide Aboriginal groups with notice
of the timing and schedule of the NEB hearing, and will also provide an opportunity for
Aboriginal groups to discuss with NEB staff and other potential regulators the various
ways to participate in the NEB process. The Crown encourages Aboriginal groups that
have project-related concerns to convey these concerns to the NEB, either orally or in
writing, through the NEB hearing process. To facilitate your participation in the NEB
process, NGTL’s application, as well as the Hearing Order and other regulatory
documents, will be publicly available on the NEB’s website at vaw.neb-one.gc.ca.

Canada"

Through the NEB hearing process, the NEB, in accordance with its obligations under the
National Energy Board Act and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, will
consider the concerns raised by Aboriginal groups. Federal Responsible Authorities will
participate in this process to further understand the concerns of Aboriginal groups
regarding the relationship between their regulatory decisions for the project and any
possible adverse impacts on potential or established Aboriginal or treaty rights.

The Crown will actively monitor the NEB process, as well as any other applicable EA
and regulatory processes, to assess the sufﬁciency of these processes to discharge the
Crown duty to consult. Further to this assessment, federal authorizations for the
proposed project will only be issued once the Crown determines that its consultation
obligations with respect to these authorizations have been discharged.

Should you have any questions regarding the Government of Canada’s established review
process for the proposed project under the NEB, please contact Carla Osborne,
Aboriginal Engagement Specialist with the NEB 403-299-3 705, or the NEB’S main
number at 1-800-899-1265. Should you have questions on the MPMO initiative in
general or on the Crown’s duty to consult for NEB projects subject to the MPMO
process, please contact Scott Clausen, Senior Policy Advisor with the MPMO, at 613-
995-7506 or sclausenmznrcan.goca. For more information on the MPMO Initiative,
please refer to the attached Cabinet Directive on Improving the Performance of the
Regulatory System for Major Natural Resource Projects, or visit the MPMO’S website at

   Dear Chief Wilison:
   Further to our previous correspondence of March 2010, the purpose of this letter is to
   provide you with additional information on the process for Crown consultation with
   Aboriginal groups during the regulatory process for the NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd’s
   (NGTL) proposed Horn River Mainline Project.
   The federal regulatory review process for the project is being managed through the
   Government’s Major Projects Management Office (MPMO) Initiative. The project is
   subject to a screening-level environmental assessment (EA) review under the Canadian
   Environmental Assessment Act (CEA Act).
   The Crown will rely on the National Energy Board (NEB) process, to the extent possible,
   to fulfil any Crown duty to consult Aboriginal groups. Using the NEB process, the
   following general steps are being followed by the Crown to identify, consider and
   address the potential adverse impacts of the proposed project on established or
   potential Aboriginal or treaty rights:
             1) As part of its enhanced Aboriginal engagement process initiated after
             receiving the Project Description, the NEB contacted potentially affected
             Aboriginal groups by letter and by telephone to introduce the regulatory process
             and offer to meet to discuss both the federal review process for the proposed
             project, and the various ways to participate in the NEB hearing process. You will
             recall that the NEB contacted you by letter dated June 2009 in this regard.
             2) The proponent for the project, NGTL, is required to engage and consult
             potentially affected Aboriginal groups both prior to, and after, the filing of its
             Project Application for the Horn River project with the NEB. The purpose of this
             consultation is to explain the proposed project to Aboriginal groups and to
             provide them with the opportunity to raise any concerns about the proposed
             project directly with NGTL. The NEB procedures also require the proponent
             provide information in the Project Application on the nature of the concerns
             raised by Aboriginal groups and their efforts to address them through project
             design and mitigation measures.
             3) Following receipt of the Project Application from NGTL, the NEB issued a
             Hearing Order on April 27, 2010 for the project review, which provided
             information about the public hearing process, including options for those wishing
        Canada           li
         to participate. Through the public hearing process, the NEB, in accordance with
        its obligations under the National Energy Board Act and the CEA Act, will
        consider project-related concerns raised by Aboriginal groups.
        4) Aboriginal groups that have project-related concerns that have not already
        been resolved with NGTL are encouraged to convey these concerns to the NEB,
        either orally or in writing, through the NEB public hearing process. Please refer to
        the NEB Hearing Order for a description of participation options. Please note that
        certain participation options have a deadline. To access the Hearing Order and
        the electronic repository, go to the NEB’s website www.neb-one.cic.ca, click on

        Links and select NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. Application for the Horn River
        Mainline (GH-2-2010) from the list.
        5) Transport Canada is also engaged as a federal regulatory authority for the
        proposed project. Transport Canada is participating in the NEB process to further
        understand the concerns Aboriginal groups may have regarding the possible
        effects of its federal regulatory decisions on potential or established Aboriginal or
        treaty rights. Federal authorizations for the proposed project will only be issued
        once the Crown determines that its consultation obligations with respect to each
        of these authorizations have been discharged. Attached is information about
        Transport Canada’s mandate and responsibilities, including relevant contact
        information. The Crown encourages you to contact these representatives, if you

   Dear Ms. Nicholson:
   Further to our previous correspondence of June 2009, the purpose of this letter is to
   provide you with additional information on the process for Crown consultation with
   Aboriginal groups during the regulatory process for the NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd’s
   (NGTL) proposed Horn River Mainline Project.
   The federal regulatory review process for the project is being managed through the
   Government’s Major Projects Management Office (MPMO) Initiative. The project is
   subject to a screening-level environmental assessment (EA) review under the Canadian
   Environmental Assessment Act (CEA Act).
   The Crown will rely on the National Energy Board (NEB) process, to the extent possible,
   to fulfil any Crown duty to consult Aboriginal groups. Using the NEB process, the
   following general steps are being followed by the Crown to identify, consider and
   address the potential adverse impacts of the proposed project on established or
   potential Aboriginal or treaty rights:
             1) As part of its enhanced Aboriginal engagement process initiated after
             receiving the Project Description, the NEB contacted potentially affected
             Aboriginal groups by letter and by telephone to introduce the regulatory process
             and offer to meet to discuss both the federal review process for the proposed
             project, and the various ways to participate in the NEB hearing process. You will
             recall that the NEB contacted you by letter dated June 2009 in this regard.
             2) The proponent for the project, NGTL, is required to engage and consult
             potentially affected Aboriginal groups both prior to, and after, the filing of its
             Project Application for the Horn River project with the NEB. The purpose of this
             consultation is to explain the proposed project to Aboriginal groups and to
             provide them with the opportunity to raise any concerns about the proposed
             project directly with NGTL. The NEB procedures also require the proponent
             provide information in the Project Application on the nature of the concerns
             raised by Aboriginal groups and their efforts to address them through project
             design and mitigation measures.
             3) Following receipt of the Project Application from NGTL, the NEB issued a
              Hearing Order on April 27, 2010 for the project review, which provided
             information about the public hearing process, including options for those wishing
        Canath
         to participate. Through the public hearing process, the NEBI in accordance with
        its obligations under the National Energy Board Act and the CEA Act, will
        consider project-related concerns raised by Aboriginal groups.
        4) Aboriginal groups that have project-related concerns that have not already
        been resolved with NGTL are encouraged to convey these concerns to the NEB,
        either orally or in writing, through the NEB public hearing process. Please refer to
        the NEB Hearing Order for a description of participation options. Please note that
        certain participation options have a deadline. To access the Hearing Order and

        Regulatory Documents “View” on the right-hand side of the screen, then °Quick
        Links” and select NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. Application for the Horn River
        Mainline (GH-2-2010) from the list.

            2) The proponent for the project, NGTL, is required to engage and consult
            potentially affected Aboriginal groups both prior to, and after, the filing of its
            Project Application for the Horn River project with the NEB. The purpose of this
            consultation is to explain the proposed project to Aboriginal groups and to
            provide them with the opportunity to raise any concerns about the proposed
            project directly with NGTL. The NEB procedures also require the proponent
            provide information in the Project Application on the nature of the concerns
            raised by Aboriginal groups and their efforts to address them through project
            design and mitigation measures.
            3) Following receipt of the Project Application from NGTL, the NEB issued a
             HeaMng Order on April 27, 2010 for the project review, which provided
             information about the public hearing process, including options for those wishing
            to participate. Through the public hearing process, the NEB, in accordance with
                      114
       uanaua
         its obilgations under the National Energy Board Act and the CEA Act, will
        consider project-related concerns raised by Aboriginal groups.
        4) Aboriginal groups that have project-related concerns that have not already
        been resolved with NGTL are encouraged to convey these concerns to the NEB,
        either orally or in writing, through the NEB public hearing process. Please refer to
        the NEB Hearing Order for a description of participation options. Please note that
        certain participation options have a deadline. To access the Hearing Order and
        the electronic repository, go to the NEB’s website www.neb-one.gc.ca, click on
        Regulatory Documents “View” on the right-hand side of the screen, then “Quick
        Links” and select NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. Application for the Horn River
        Mainline (GH-2-2010) from the list.
        5) Transport Canada is also engaged as a federal regulatory authority for the
        proposed project. Transport Canada is participating in the NEB process to further
        understand the concerns Aboriginal groups may have regarding the possible
        effects of its federal regulatory decisions on potential or established Aboriginal or
        treaty rights. Federal authorizations for the proposed project will only be issued
        once the Crown determines that its consultation obligations with respect to each
        of these authorizations have been discharged. Attached is information about
        Transport Canada’s mandate and responsibilities, including relevant contact
        information. The Crown encourages you to contact these representatives, if you
        would like to schedule a meeting to learn more about Transport Canada’s
        decision-making responsibilities and the Crown’s participation in the NEB
        process.

    Attention: Ms Anne-Marie Erickson          — Secretary of the Board
     Re:  Fort   Nelson Forestry Round Table Committee Support of Horn River Pipeline (Nova
    Gai) Clearing Activities in the Winter 2010/201 I Season
     Dear Ms. Erickson,
    We of the Fort Nelson Forestry Round Table Committee (FNFRTC), a Committee of the Northern
    Rockies Regional Municipality are writing to you with the intent of expressing our support in the
    potential opportunity of having local community members participate in the clearing of the Horn
     River Pipeline starting in the winter of 2010/201?. It is our understanding that under norma] NEB
    application review time-lines the potential approval wguld not normally come in time to start
     clearing activities this upcoming winter season. We would like to express to you the many benefits
    our local community members could realize if they had the opportunity to participate in the clearing
     activities this upcoming winter.
     Last winter on a different pipeline project in the district it was brought to the attention of the
     FNFRTC that there was local interest in having the pipeline cleared prior to spring melt conditions.
    After closer inspection it was realized that although there were many benefits to clearing in the
    winter months prior to actual pipeline construction the time-lines were too constrained to make this
     pipeline clearing situation a reality. There are many beneficial outcomes to clearing the land in
    advance of pipeline construction from a local Fort Nelson perspective as well as from an operational
    perspective. This letter will address these benefits.
    Typically, a pipeline company will clear and construct a pipeline within the same season. In ordeIE
    do so, large contractors are required to ensure the work will be completed in a timely matter. As a
     result of this, they require equipment from outside the Fort Nelson area in order to meet the
     demands of tight time limits thus reducing the opportunities for local employment and contracts. If
     clearing activities were to commence in advance of pipeline construction, the opportunity would
     exist for multiple smaller local clearing companies to obtain work. This would have a positive
     beneficial impact for the community of Fort Nelson. Currently, with the rising expansion of activity
     in the Horn River Basin many locals are not realizing the positive impacts of this rise in activity due to
     many workers being flown directly from outside our community right into the field/town and camp.
AUG—04—2010       12:15                     1 260 774 6794                     96Z                       P.002
 08/04/10     11:12 FAX 1 250 774 6794              TOWN OF FORT NELSON/NRRD                               I1OO3
     Many small forest clearing companies and workers in Fort Nelson have had to deal with mill closures
     in the last few years and this has impacted some companies to financial instability or bankruptcy. The
     opportunity to clear the Horn River Pipeline this winter in advance of pipeline construction would
     create the potential for some of these local companies and workers to regain stability in the local
     economy. Some of these local clearing companies are First Nation owned and operated and thus,
     would aiso provide opportunities to local First Nation employees and contractors and give
     opportunity to both native and non-native community members.
     One key benefit to mention regatding the winter clearing in advance of pipeline construction is the
     quality use of frozen ground.           Fort Nelson can have unpredictable winter conditions and
     unpredictable spring thaws. Clearing this upcoming winter would aid in the pipeline construction
     phase which would be able to concentrate on freezing in ground early on already cleared right-of-
     way. Another potential benefit is the increase possibilities of wood utilization as a wider audience
     would be created over a longer length of time for utilization due the project being spanned over two
     seasons. The immediate removal of timber would not be as critical due to no grubbing activities or
     pipeline construction following clearing.
     The proposed project area is located in an area of oil arid gas actMty by multiple users. The
     proposed pipeline parallels existing pipelines, high-grade roads, gas facilities, well sites and camps
     throughout the area. Due to the existing level of activity in the area the spanning of the project over
     two seasons would have minimal effect on the targeted land base. In summary, there are many
     benefits that can be derived from clearing the area this upcoming winter in advance of pipeline
     construction. The following summarizes the key benefits that the FNRTC anticipates:
   )       increasing the employment opportunities for local residents
           increasing the contract opportunities for local clearing companies
   >       increasing the employment and contract opportunities for First Nations members
   >       minimizing time constraints and production deadlines to allow locals to perform clearing
           creating continuity of employment
   >       contract earnings would return and circulate into the community of Fort Nelson
   >       pro-active use of frozen ground conditions with pre-clearing prior to pipeline construction
           fostering relationships between local residents, local contractors and local First Nations
   >       increasing social benefits to Fort Nelson families and the community
   >       To facilitate the actual removal and utilization of timber in a cost effective manner as possible.
   >       continuity of employment over longer length to perform clearing and pipeline activities
     We understand that there are many protocols and procedures that the NEB faces when assessing
     projects like the Horn River Pipeline and we also understand that there are limitations beyond our
      understanding that could inhibit a request such as this. The primary goal of this letter is to express
     our support and benefits in the potential opportunity of having local community members participate
      in the clearing of the Horn River Pipeline starting in the winter of 2010/2011 prior to pipeline
      construction.

        Re: Support of TCPL Horn River Pipeline ROW Clearing in the winter 10111 season
        Attention: Ms. Anne-Marie Erickson, Secretary of the Board
        Dear Ms. Erickson,
        Eh-Cho-Dene Enterprises, a locally band owned Fort Nelson First Nation company that
       performs heavy equipment & service contracts in the resource sector in Fort Nelson, BC. We
       have been approached by TCPL with the potential opportunity of being involved in contracts for
       the proposed Horn River Pipeline Project. We are also under the understanding that the Fort
       Nelson Forestry Round Table Committee is expressing their support to you regarding the
       possibihty of clearing this Winter2010/201 1 season. We would also fike to convey to you our
       support for clearing the proposed pipeline this winter in advance of pipeline construction. The
       possibility of this happening would greatly assist us in the potential for us to take on a project of
       this magnitude. There are many positive impacts that our company could benefit from if we had
      the opportunity to perform the clearing in advance of the pipeline construction.
       Currently, we provide employment for local First Nation Band and Non-Band members, local
      Metis members, local Community members as well as sub-contracts to both Native and Non-
       Native local resource based companies. The primary benefit to Eh-Cho-Dene in clearing the
       Horn River Pipeline this winter in advance of pipeline construction would be greater flexibility,
      time and resources. We would gain the ability to manage operations with a longer window for
      clearing activities. In this way, we would be able to participate with more of our own employees,
      equipment, local contractors (native and non-native) and be overall less reliant on outside
      support to fulfill contract obligations. We would be able to capitalize on frozen ground over a
      longer period of time which would benefit the areas not suitable to non-frozen condlions.
      There has been issues brought up within the Band itself, the lands department and our own
      First Nations members regarding the proposed Horn River Pipeline Project. As long as we can
      conclude these issues in a positive way and in a timely manner, I believe clearing the proposed
      Horn River Pipeline Project this upcoming 2010/2011 winter would be a positive action for Eh
      Cho-Dene Enterprises and for all workers and contractors associated with our company.
      I thank-you in advance for your review and consideration of this matter,
      Mussi

        Environment Canada Comments
Environment Canada has reviewed the application for the proposed Horn River
Project (the Project), which was filed by NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (the
proponent) with the National Energy Board (NEB). Environment Canada focused
its review on the Environmental and Socio-Economic Impact Assessment (ESA),
which supports the application, and the proponent’s responses to other
departmental Information Requests (IRs). As an expert federal authority,
Environment Canada offers the following comments concerning wildlife and
water quality in accordance with section 12(3) of the Canadian Environmental
Assessment Act (CEAA).
WILDLIFE AND WILDLIFE HABITAT
The Canadian Wildlife Service of Environment Canada herein provides
comments on the above-noted Project proposal ESA (dated February 2010),
including the following section:
           Appendix 4 Wildlife Survey and Habitat Assessment for the Nova Gas
            Transmission Ltd. Horn River Mainline Project (Appendix 4) prepared
            by TERA Environmental Consultants, dated February 2010.
Briefly, from the ESA we note that, ‘The Project will consist of approximately 71.9
km of 914.4 mm O.D. (NPS 36) natural gas pipeline (the Cabin Mainline),
pipeline risers, valves and blind flanges to accommodate the potential installation
of launcher and receiver facilities for in-line inspection, Supervisory Control and
Data Acquisition (SCADA), block valves, cathodic protection and associated
 miscellaneous works. Proposed facilities consist of the Sierra, Cabin, Komie East
and Little Hay Creek meter stations. The meter stations will include custody
transfer metering, communication and control systems and associated piping and
valves. New piping will also be installed at the existing Ekwan Meter Station.
NGTL is also proposing a 2.2 km 609.6 mm O.D. (NPS 24) natural gas pipeline,
referred to as the Komie East Extension. The purpose of the Komie East
Extension is to connect the Horn River Mainline with the Spectra Energy Inc. Fort
Nelson North Processing Facility (Spectra Facility) in d-48-I/94-P-4’.
We also note for the purpose of our review that:
            The Project does not cross any federal lands including national parks,
             national wildlife areas, migratory bird sanctuaries or Indian reserves;
            The proponent has chosen the option to pursue the temporary pipeline
             and access road to Cabin Lake for use in hydrostatic testing of the
             completed sections of pipeline;
            The proposed Project reflects proponent consultation with the
             provincial Ministry of Environment and Environment Canada regarding
             boreal caribou, and that it has been aligned to minimize disturbance to
             the West Kotcho Core;
            The Proponent plans to minimize potential construction-related
             disturbance to boreal caribou through adherence to timing windows in
             consultation with MoE;
            The proponent plans to do all works associated with the Project
             outside of the migratory bird breeding sensitivity window, identified
             generally as May 1 to July 31 for this region;
            The proponent plans to minimize impacts to wetland ecosystems by
             undertaking clearing and construction during the winter months.
(A) MIGRATORY BIRDS
Incidental Take
‘Incidental Take’ refers to the killing of migratory birds, and/or the disturbance or
destruction of their nests or eggs resulting directly or indirectly from human
activities, and is incidental to the primary objective of the activity. Environment
Canada advises that due diligence must be exercised to avoid harm to migratory
birds, their nests and eggs.
Until 2005, when Bill C-15 was passed, the Migratory Birds Convention Act
(MBCA) did not contain the requisite legal authority to support an authorization or
permit framework that would allow for a limited degree of incidental take of
migratory birds or their nests. The Bill also clarified the purpose of the Act by
referring to both the protection and conservation of migratory birds explicitly as
individuals and as populations. These two amendments provide the legal
authority for the development of a permitting or authorization scheme for the
incidental take of migratory birds in Canada, while still achieving conservation
goals. These amendments therefore serve to correct technical problems with
                                                                                      2
 respect to the issuance of capture, kill or salvage permits, and all matters of
direct relevance to the issues of birds oiled at sea. It also removes possible legal
impediments to finding regulatory solutions related to incidental take associated
with impacts from resource harvesting, agriculture, fisheries, and other such
activities occurring over the landscape.
Until such time a regulatory framework, as described briefly above, is in place,
Environment Canada continues to recommend that industry avoid activities that
will result in the disturbance or destruction of active migratory bird nests. Where
a proponent determines its activities will unavoidably overlap with the breeding
bird season, Environment Canada recommends that the proponent employ an
Active Migratory Bird Nest Survey Program (AMBNS) to reduce the likelihood of
disturbing or destroying active nests. Doing so in turn reduces the likelihood that
the proponent will be in contravention of the MBCA.
The migratory bird breeding season varies between regions across British
Columbia. The period of March 15th to August 15th will generally include
breeding activity for most though not all avian species across the province of
British Columbia. Environment Canada can advise on more specific breeding
periods on a project-by-project basis. Environment Canada recommends that an
AMBNS be employed if potentially harmful activities are proposed for a period
immediately before, during or immediately after the general breeding bird
season. Environment Canada may provide advice to the proponent in the
development of an AMBNS if the proponent makes that request.
Project-specific comments and recommendations
As mentioned, the proponent proposes to schedule construction work during
winter months to avoid adverse effects on nesting migratory birds and wetlands.
This is a key measure in particular for migratory birds, in order to avoid potential
impacts.
From Appendix 4, the following wildlife surveys were undertaken in support of the
Project:
            Preliminary aerial (helicopter) overview flyover October 23 and 24,
             2008
            Winter aerial (helicopter) wildlife survey March 16 and 18, 2009 (36%
             of the currently proposed alignment surveyed);
            Summer aerial (helicopter) and ground wildlife surveys (approximately
             43% of the alignment surveyed)
Observations of any stick nests, old growth forest and other such wildlife and
habitat features were recorded during the winter survey.
Environment Canada requests clarification on whether searches for stick nests
were completed during the summer survey work as well.
                                                                                     3
 Appendix 4 indicates that not all of the alignment has been fully surveyed for
stick nests and roost sites to date. As such, Environment Canada recommends:
        That the proposed Project area be intensively assessed and searches
         completed for stick nests, roost sites and other important wildlife elements
         and habitat features, within and adjacent to the proposed alignment, prior
         to grubbing, vegetation removal and other such project-related activities
         that have the potential to disturb or harm wildlife.
        That should significant wildlife elements and features be identified, the
         proponent implement the appropriate best practices measures, including
         for example, the Best Management Practices for Raptor Conservation
         During Urban and Rural Land Development in British Columbia:
         www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/documents/bmp/raptor_bmp_final.pdf.
        That for wildlife and wildlife associated habitats, the proponent consult
         with the provincial Ministry of Environment.
Environment Canada supports that supplemental studies as proposed under
section 5.1 of Appendix 4 are undertaken; specifically, that the proponent will:
       Conduct a winter wildlife survey in winter 2010. A substantial portion of the
        pipeline route was realigned following the March 2009 wildlife survey. The
        focus of the winter 2010 survey will be on segments of the initial pipeline
        route that have been realigned since March 2009, as well as the proposed
        Komie East Extension and the contingency hydrostatic test pipeline routes
        (i.e., all segments not previously surveyed in winter); and,
       Conduct a wildlife survey in spring/summer 2010 for segments where
        minor route refinements have been made since the June/July 2009
        summer wildlife survey.
From Appendix 4, including Appendix 4C, we were unable to locate specific
information regarding the wildlife surveys, including for example:
       A map showing the location and number of transects and point counts
        completed during the summer wildlife surveys for migratory birds;
       The habitats surveyed, and the proportion of each habitat present in the
        Project area (Local Study Area);
       The number, distribution and relative abundance of migratory birds within
        each habitat type surveyed; and
       The types of survey protocols used.
The above information is critical to our review of the Project and we request it be
made available for our review in this environmental assessment review process.
It is not clear from Appendix 4 whether surveys were completed for specific bird
groups, such as waterfowl (including swan and geese), marsh birds, bats
(including roots) and/or raptors. The data collected has not been presented such
that links between habitats and species distributions (amongst other things) can
                                                                                    4
 be readily deciphered, and thus makes more challenging our full assessment of
the nature and extent of potential impacts to migratory birds (and by extension,
the need for any additional mitigation, in particular, short-term measures).
Environment Canada also recommends:
        That the post construction monitoring program referenced in the
         documentation includes follow up surveys of breeding and resident bird
         use of the Project area to confirm the predictions stated in the ESA (we
         note that summer surveys did detect a diverse population of migratory
         birds using habitats within the Local Study Area and Project footprint).
        That the habitats of those species that exhibit a high fidelity to nest sites,
         such as the Sandhill Crane, or those species with specialized
         requirements, such as cavity-nesters, are either avoided or mitigated for
         before commencement of the following breeding season. In this regard,
         protection of wildlife trees and snags is recommended.
(B) SPECIES AT RISK
Overview
The purpose of the Species at Risk Act (SARA) is to prevent or reduce the
likelihood of wildlife species from becoming extinct or extirpated, to provide for the
recovery of wildlife species that are extirpated, endangered or threatened as a
result of human activity, and to manage species of special concern to prevent
them from becoming endangered or threatened.
SARA was proclaimed on June 5, 2003 and affords protection to those wildlife
species listed in Schedule 1 of the Act. The prohibitions under SARA came into
force on June 1, 2004, and apply to individuals of a species, their residences
(dwelling places, such as a den or nest or other similar area that is occupied or
habitually occupied by one or more individual during part or all of its life cycle), and
critical habitat (areas used or formerly used by the species to carry out their life
processes that are deemed essential for survival or recovery). Critical habitat will
be identified for each listed species in Recovery Strategies and/or Action Plans,
available on Environment Canada’s Species at Risk Act Public Registry:
www.sararegistry.gc.ca.
The Canada-British Columbia Agreement on Species at Risk commits the
Province to assess species under its jurisdiction. Environment Canada may offer
an opinion on the adequacy of mitigation measures accepted by the Province of
British Columbia.
Woodland Caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) - Boreal Population
Environment Canada is presently consulting with Canadians to gather
information to help develop a national recovery strategy for boreal caribou in
Canada. Under SARA, a national recovery strategy must be developed for a
threatened species. The woodland caribou (boreal population) was listed as a
                                                                                        5
 ‘Threatened’ species in Canada when SARA was passed in June 2003. This
listing was based on an assessment made by the Committee on the Status of
Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) in 2002. The reasons for assessing
boreal caribou as Threatened were that populations have decreased throughout
most of their range, and they are threatened by habitat loss and increased
predation, the latter possibly facilitated by human activities.
At this time, Environment Canada does not have enough information to identify
critical habitat for the boreal caribou. However, Environment Canada is
committed to developing a national recovery strategy for boreal caribou that
includes the identification of critical habitat to the extent possible. The purpose of
identifying critical habitat is to ensure that it is protected from human activities
that would result in its destruction. Once critical habitat is identified, the federal
government must protect the portions of critical habitat that occur on federal
lands. In addition, under SARA, the provinces and territories must provide
effective protection for those portions of critical habitat that occur on non-federal
lands. Protection may take a variety of forms such as, prohibiting certain
activities, implementing habitat management plans, and establishing stewardship
agreements. Notwithstanding that identification of critical habitat has not yet
been completed, it is imperative that project proposals, including those falling
under the purview of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act and other
such regulatory and planning processes, minimize their likely adverse
environmental effects and that measures be adopted to stabilize and improve
conditions for this species.
In order to assist in the determination of what constitutes critical habitat for boreal
caribou, Environment Canada undertook a scientific review of boreal caribou
habitat needs. The review focused on the habitat needed for local populations of
boreal caribou to be self-sustaining. To complete the task, experts in caribou
biology and landscape ecology worked together to provide scientific advice on
the critical habitat needs of boreal caribou. This advice was published in the
Scientific Review for the Identification of Critical Habitat for Woodland Caribou
(Rangifer tarandus caribou), Boreal Population, in Canada. A brief summary of
the findings of the scientific review is available by contacting Environment
Canada, or at:
www.sararegistry.gc.ca/species/speciesDetails_e.cfm?sid=636#ot31.
Key findings of the scientific review were that:
        Critical habitat for boreal caribou would most appropriately be identified by
         taking into account the habitat needs of caribou across the entire local
         population range rather than focusing only on the habitat needs for a
         particular part of the life cycle or time of the year.
        Land-use management that takes into account all activities occurring
         within a local population range is essential to the recovery of caribou in
         order to maintain the space and habitat characteristics they require. This
                                                                                       6
        is because boreal caribou need very large tracts of land with low numbers
       of predators, in addition to specific areas to carry out their life cycle
       (feeding, calving, rearing young, wintering, etc).
      Activities can occur within boreal caribou habitat without threatening the
       species as long as their cumulative effects do not destroy the biological
       and physical attributes necessary for boreal caribou survival and recovery.
       The scientific review outlined some of these attributes and further scientific
       work is ongoing to provide more detail on the specific habitat needs of
       caribou as well as the level and type of disturbance that can occur within a
       range and still maintain a self-sustaining population of boreal caribou.
Project-specific comments and recommendations
The proponent’s proposed measures with respect to listed migratory bird species
are reasonable. The comments provided in the previous section would apply
here for listed species habitat requirements.
Environment Canada recommends:
      That the proponent undertake supplemental vegetation surveys along the
       proposed route in order to assess rare species and communities prior to
       construction; and
      In the event rare species or communities are detected, that avoidance
       options be given highest priority, followed by impact mitigation and, lastly,
       salvage as the least preferred option.
Boreal Caribou, West Kotcho Core Area
From Appendix 4, we note that the Project crosses over approximately 59 km of
the Snake Sahtaneh range and 8 km of the West Kotcho Core Area. For the
Snake Sahtaneh range, the scientific review determined a high weight of
evidence that:
       The current range is not self sustaining given declining trend and very
        high total disturbance; and
       Anthropogenic disturbance at 56% suggests need for improved condition.
We note that the winter wildlife survey identified caribou sign (only) outside of the
Project area.
We note proposed mitigation in sections 3.1.2 and 5.2 (Table 9) of Appendix 4 for
this species, and recommend that the provincial Ministry of Environment be
consulted (and Environment Canada as appropriate) in implementation of these
measures. Realignment of the initial proposal to parallel the Komie Road in the
West Kotcho Core, and the proposed timing of project activities outside of calving
and other sensitive periods, are examples of key mitigation measures for this
                                                                                    7
 Project proposal. They appear to be consistent with draft guidelines 1 developed
for the oil and gas industry for project proposals in boreal caribou range habitat.
Along these lines, Environment Canada recommends that the proponent:
          Describe how proposed Project mitigation is consistent with the draft
           guidelines for the boreal caribou.
It is appropriate that threats to boreal caribou at the project level require that
mitigation and management strategies be applied consistently and at every
opportunity to reduce or avoid adverse environmental impacts. While Table 9
alludes to the following recommendations, we include them below for
completeness:
          That stands of mature (old) spruce forests within and adjacent to the
           Project are retained to reduce losses to potential forage habitats wherever
           feasible.
          That appropriate areas are protected and managed to promote
           regeneration of caribou habitat where impacts are sustained. A tabulation
           of anticipated impacts and habitat mitigation need to be explicitly
           documented to ensure impacts are fully managed.
          With respect to predator management, that the existing vegetation
           complex in and associated with the Project footprint be retained.
Canada Warbler (Wilsonia canadensis)
The proponent should be aware this species is now listed on Schedule I of the
SARA as ‘Threatened’. As a consequence of the listing, the protective measures
for individuals and residences - sections 32 and 33 - apply to this species
wherever it is found in Canada.
Olive-sided Flycatcher (Contopus cooperi)
The proponent should be aware this species is now listed on Schedule I of the
SARA as ‘Threatened’. As a consequence of the listing, the protective measures
for individuals and residences - sections 32 and 33 - apply to this species
wherever it is found in Canada. We note summer wildlife surveys detected this
species in the Project area; in this regard, the proponent’s plan of clearing and
constructing during the winter months is recommended.
In the event clearing and/or construction was proposed during the breeding
season, the proponent should be aware that Environment Canada is not currently
in a position to issue a permit under the MBCA or SARA (for migratory birds) in
the context of incidental take. It is prudent therefore that the proponent evaluate
any potential SARA permit requirements for anticipated impacts to migratory
birds under federal jurisdiction listed as Threatened or Endangered. The
conditions under which a SARA permit can be issued are stringent. New species

 are added to Schedule I of SARA on an annual basis, while others are removed.
The above-referenced Olive-sided Flycatcher has been documented in the
Project area. Environment Canada recommends that the proponent consider the
potential implications of the listing of this and other species in relation to its
Project.
(C) WETLAND ECOSYSTEMS
Federal Policy on Wetland Conservation (FPWC)
Environment Canada is the federal department responsible for providing expert
support in the implementation of the FPWC. Wetlands are a priority for
Environment Canada because of their importance to, amongst other things, the
maintenance of migratory bird populations for which the department has a
responsibility under the MBCA, and protection of species at risk for which the
department has a responsibility under SARA.
If the federal government is involved in a project in a way that triggers CEAA, it
should consider the FPWC. CEAA requires a consideration of the cumulative
environmental effects likely to result from the project in combination with other
projects or activities that have been or will be carried out (para. 16(1)(a)). The
FPWC recognizes the importance of considering cumulative effects and tailors
expected wetland protection outcomes to the level of cumulative effects
experienced in an area.
Project-specific comments and recommendations
In the context of the FPWC, the proponent’s assessment and mitigation
strategies for all forms of wetland ecosystems found along and adjacent to the
project footprint appear reasonable. As some of these ecosystems (notably
peatlands) have occurred partly due to the cold climate conditions, it is
anticipated that their recovery from disturbance-related works and activities
would be relatively slow.
From Appendix 2 we note the Project crosses approximately 26 km of wetland
habitat, and that this estimate will be refined based on the proposed summer
2010 wetland assessment. Environment Canada requests that this information
be forwarded to our attention for review and comment.
From Appendix 4 (page 24) it is noted that the marsh habitat associated with
Lichen Creek supports the highest diversity of birds within areas surveyed. We
note the various proposed mitigation measures under Table 9, and they are
reasonable. For clarity, the recommendation to construct during the winter
months and avoid the general breeding bird season are recommendations that
Environment Canada understands to apply to all wetlands within the Project area
and not just to Lichen Creek.
We note from Appendix 2 (Wetland Assessment), section 7.1.1, that the
proponent has cited several reports in support of pipeline construction having
                                                                                   9
 little impact to wetlands, including to communities that form or are associated
with wetlands and to wetland species diversity. Nevertheless, given the relative
paucity of science-based research on the long-term effects of pipeline project on
wetlands in Canada, Environment Canada recommends that:
        A pre- and post-construction wetland monitoring plan, to assess functional
         recovery (vegetation complement, internal water movement, surface water
         movement, wildlife presence, distribution and abundance) of these
         systems, be developed as part of the environmental assessment review
         process.
The above recommendation is consistent with other pipeline projects; for
example, refer to the following report:
        Critchley, D., and Foote, A.L. 2008-2009. Wetland Follow-up Monitoring
         Program Second Year Activities Summary for the TMX – Anchor Loop
         Project. Department of Renewable Resources, University of Alberta.
In support of this approach, Environment Canada is prepared to assist the
proponent through a review of a draft plan.
(D) CUMULATIVE EFFECTS
The ESA provided an assessment of cumulative effects of the Project’s
construction and operation on the values of the regional, local and project areas.
The cumulative effects modeling done for the listed Boreal Caribou populations
and their viability within the identified core areas raise concerns for the
department. The model predictions for the West Kotcho Core Area, which the
Project crosses, indicate that with the existing level of fragmentation (without
considering this project), the West Kotcho herd is not sustainable over the long
term. The proponent’s proposed measure to realign its original project to parallel
for some distance the existing access road to minimize the project’s contribution
to the fragmentation of core caribou habitat is important mitigation. In addition,
the proponent has proposed additional mitigation measures to reduce residual
effects relating to predator access, increased human access, and a wider right of
way (pipeline plus access road).
Project-specific comments and recommendations
Cumulative Effects Scenarios
The proponent has provided a broad list of potential development projects that
are likely to occur within the same region and that would have the potential to
cause additional effects on the local boreal caribou population. Environment
Canada notes, however, that the assessment did not include some probable
development scenarios for the Horn River Basin. Along these lines, the Project
is being proposed to increase capacity to move gas from the Horn River Basin to
facilities elsewhere. The Horn River Basin is within the range of the Boreal
Caribou and likely includes core habitats for this species. Likely development
                                                                                   10
 scenarios, including potential well densities, supporting infrastructure (both
exploratory and production), and their associated anticipated effects assessed
over a 5 to 20 year time horizon would provide for a robust cumulative effects
assessment for this Project.
Project Alignment
The ESA states that the project footprint or right of way will vary from 21-47 m
where not paralleling the existing road, and from 39-78 m where it does. The
proponent has indicated a willingness to narrow the proposed right-of-way, where
warranted, to avoid wetland features, discontinuous permafrost, and other
sensitive habitat features. While we recognize that the existing road is a main
resource road for this area and that there already is an existing level of
disturbance associated with it, it remains unclear as to whether the combination
of the pipeline right of way and the road will act as a barrier to the movement of
wildlife (caribou in particular), and as such bifurcate and isolate the western
portion of the West Kotcho core area. The 2010 telemetry of this core area
indicates a high density of collared animals utilizing the western portion. With
this in mind, Environment Canada recommends that:
       The proponent minimize any barriers to the free passage of wildlife
        (targeting Boreal Caribou) across the right of way;
       The proponent take measures to reduce the line of sight where possible;
       The proponent develop and implement a monitoring program to evaluate
        whether the combined effects of the pipeline and road act as a barrier and
        whether the proposed mitigation measures are effective; and
       That both recommendations are undertaken in consultation with the
        provincial Ministry of Environment and Environment Canada.
General
The Proponent shall ensure that all work associated with the subject project
complies with the requirements of the Fisheries Act, the Canadian Environmental
Protection Act, 1999, the Migratory Birds Convention Act, the Species at Risk Act
and all other applicable laws, legislation, and best management practices.
WATER QUALITY
Hydrostatic Testing
The documentation indicates that the pipeline will be hydrostatically tested prior
to operation. Specifically, the proponent has proposed that
     approximately 60,000 m3 of water will be withdrawn from Cabin Lake
        under frozen conditions and the line will be removed prior to spring break-
        up;
     the pipeline will be tested in six test sections and the hydrostatic test line
        will cross one waterbody; and
                                                                                    11
        no additives or chemicals will be used in the water when testing the
        pipeline.
Based on the information provided, Environment Canada offers the following
Best Management Practices (BMPs) related to the hydrostatic testing process:
       The proponent should consider and investigate the environmental impacts
        of the proposed discharge in the environmental assessment.
       Discharge may erode waterway bottom and bank materials and surficial
        soils on land. Proper dewatering structures should be designed.
       The discharge of hazardous constituents to the environment can be
        reduced through filtering and treatment.
       Sampling of discharge waters should be conducted to ensure that the
        discharged test fluid meets the requirements and the treatment process is
        working properly.
       Hydrostatic test fluids could be transported offsite for treatment (if
        required) and disposal.
       A cleaning program for the pipeline should be implemented to minimize
        the amount of residual contamination picked up by the test fluid.
       Treatment and disposal of hydrostatic test fluid should be addressed in the
        Environmental Protection Plan.
       Minimizing the test segment length should be considered so as to
        minimize the amount of test water required.
General
The proponent should be aware that section 36(3) of the federal Fisheries Act,
administered by Environment Canada, prohibits the discharge of deleterious
substances to waters frequented by fish, or to a place where those substances
might enter such waters. Therefore, the proponent must ensure that, at all times
during the project, deleterious substances are prevented from entering into fish-
bearing waters or any tributaries. Due diligence is required at all times to prevent
such discharges, and adherence to the proposed courses of action suggested in
this letter does not relieve the proponent of the requirement to comply with the
Fisheries Act.
                                                                                  12

October 26, 2010      Re: Late Intervenor Application - NOVA Horn River Project
I want to thank the Board for entertaining my late intervenor status request on NOVA’s Horn River
Project hearing.
Reason for late intervenor status
During the NOVA project intervenor deadline of May 28, 2010, I was already researching the topic
of cumulative effects by the energy sector in northeast BC, with a focus on the Horn River Basin. I
was ignorant of the present project review regarding NOVA Transmission, and did not at that time
understand many of the converging issues that came to light over the ensuing months.
It was only two weeks ago, while in the midst of preparing a report on cumulative environmental
effects in northeast BC’s shale gas plays, that I began to review the documents filed with the
National Energy Board on NOVA’s Horn River project.
After reviewing those documents, and comparing those documents with documents filed at the NEB
on Spectra’s Cabin Lake gas plant, and then comparing those documents with documents filed at
the BC Environmental Assessment Office regarding EnCana’s Cabin Gas plant, is when I began to
ask serious questions on the inter-relationships of these three projects, not identifying them as
separate review projects, but as combined projects under the theme of cumulative effects.
I then began to take interest in the NOVA project and decided to consider applying for intervenor
status, with the aim of providing the Board with summary comments based on information provided
in my new report.
My reason for intervenor status is based on a fundamental question on the inter-relationships of all
three projects with one another, and what those combined projects have, as an integrated unit, on
cumulative environmental effects. In other words, has the Board, or other intervenors, asked this
important question in scoping out the bigger picture?
In consideration of whether my status inclusion as late intervenor would at this late moment
prejudice the applicant, the answer would most likely be in the negative.
If upon the Board accepting my application as late intervenor, I would enjoy participating in the
final intervenor comment period next week, and may or may not choose to provide the Board with
brief comments, and will provide a copy of my new report.
Sincerely, Will Koop, Coordinator.

Re: Environmental Assessment of the Proposed Horn River Pipeline Project
Hearing Order GH-2-2010 and File OF-Fac-Gae-N081-2010-04 o1 ,
_ Environment Canada Comments on tho Draft Environmental Aasessmant Screening Report
W
Envitonment Canada has reviewed the draft Environmental Assessment Screening Report (the EA
Report) for the Horn River Project as proposed by NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL). The report was '
prepared by the National Energy Board (NEE) in accordance with its responsbilities under the National
Energy Board Act and the Canadian Environmental AssessmentAct. Building on our review of the
' proponent’s Application‘, as provided in our letter of August 3. 2010, Environment Canada herein offers ,
further specialist advice on the EA Report pertaining to wetlands. wildlife and species at risk.
WETLANDS -
‘ Environment Canada supports the NEB in requiring a detailed Wetland Mitigation Plan as part of any
approval granted that may be granted in relation to the proposed project Environment Canada also
concurs that ﬁve years of post-construction monitoring should be required. since wetland recovery from
disturbances related to works and activities in the project area is anticipated to be slow. Once ﬁled with.
the NEB, Environment Canada may provide further comments on the proponents updated Wetland
Mitigation Plan. Environment Canada will likely have additional advice for the proponent with respect to:
' 1. Wetland compensation projects, in the event wetland habitat and function is not retained to .
baseline conditions. as determined through post—constmction monitoring; and .-
2. The need for monitoring above and beyond the ﬁve years already identiﬁed. as and where
appropriate. '
WILDLIFE
Breeding Bird Surveys: .
The EA I‘erort indicates that the Lichen Creek breeding bird survey will be conducted as this area
' has high breeding bird diversity. Once ﬁled with the NEB, Environment Canada may provide
. further comments on the results of this survey. Environment Canada suggests that the proponent
, work with local naturalists. Bird Studies Canada. and other non-government agencies in support _
of bird monitoring beyond the one year already committed to. This recommendation recognizes
inter-annual variation in breeding bird activity.

SPECIES AT RISK . . '
Rusty Blackbird: . - .
Through NGTL's submission to the NEB on the draft EA Report. dated December17. 2010.
‘ Environment Canada became aWare that habitat suitable for the Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus .
' carolinus) occurs within the project area. As such. Environment Canada recommends that the
proponent provide an assessment of likely impacts on this species arising from the proposed .
- , project. Without this information. Environment Canada cannot fully assess or provide speciﬁc
advice on abpropriate mitigation (including compensation) for this species. Environment Canada .
also recommends that the proponent consuit arid work with the British Columbia Ministry of
Environment given that the Province of British Columbia is the lead managementjurisdiction for
this species. .
Woodland Caribou, Boreal population:
Environment Canada is cun'ently developing a national recovery strategy for Woodland Caribou.
Boreal population (also called boreal caribou). As part of this effort consultations with provincial
‘ and territorial governments. Aboriginal groups and stakeholders have been conducted and this
information, together with Aboriginal Traditional Knowledge and scientiﬁc studies, will be used to
, inform the strategy. Consistent with the Species at Risk Act (SARA). the recovery strategy will
include identiﬁcation of caribou critical habitat. to the extent possible. Environment Canada will '
post the proposed strategy on the Species at Risk Public Registry for comment in summer 2011.
Further work. including the development and implementation of action plans for boreal caribou.
will be undertaken following completion of the recovery strategy and consistent with the SARA.
Part of this work includes ensuring that critical habitat identiﬁed in the recovery strategy is
' protected. - - "
Boreal caribou are known to occur in the project area and based on the 2008 Environment .
' Canada Scientiﬁc Review, local populations of boreal caribou are currently not self-
. sustaining. Furthermore, the Scientiﬁc Review also showed a clear relationship between level of
disturbance and boreal caribou survival. In the period while development of the national recovery
. strategy is underway. and identiﬁcation of critical habitat is being completed, it is important that
regulators and project proponents take appropriate steps to avoid,'reduce and mitigate‘likely
adverse environmental effects and adopt measures to stabilize and improve conditions for this ,
species. One approach to address potentialimpacts to boreal caribou would be through
_ measures undertaken as part of an offset plan. To this end, Environment Canada supports the
NEB in determining that Boreal Woodland Can'bou (caribou) offset measures are appropriate for
, this project. Environment Canada offers the following recommendations for consideration in the
development of an offset plan:
1. That the offset plan be developed to address information gaps, scientiﬁc uncertainties and
residual effects as these relate to this speciﬁc project proposal;
2. That the offset plan be science-based,-and aimed at generating key information that could
be applied to future pipeline project pr0posals in the region;
3.. That the offset plan address any additional disturbance on the landscape as a result of
. the project, for example through monitoring. restoration. and other appropriate measures,
. in the context of the work towards a national recovery strategy and the identiﬁcationof
critical habitat in particular; and.
4. That development and implementation of the offset plan be undertaken through a
' collaborative approach involving industry. academia, government and non-government
agencies. '
- With respect to point (4) above. Environment Canada has ﬁrsthand experience in deveIOping
. ‘ industry-academia-‘govemrnent collaborations. from which science-based programs have been
