Re: Proposed NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd -— Leismer to Kettle River Crossover Project
Dear Anne-Marie and Mark,
As the Environmental Coordinator for Chipewyan Prairie Dene First Nation’s (CPDFN)
Industry Relations Corporation (IRC), I am formally submitting this ”Letter of Comment”
outlining some preliminary issues and concerns raised by the Nation in relation to the I
above captioned project. i
The proposed Leismer to Kettle River Crossover pipeline is situated within No Ha’ Nene
(Our Land) - our traditional territory (Figure 1). More specifically, it is situated within
the Kai’ Kos’ Deseh/Christina River watershed, which are traditional lands of special
interest to the Nation. Within Kai’ Kos’ Deseh/Christina River watershed both of the
proposed east-west pipeline route alternates transect the heart of Ni! tale’ ghi’a (the
White Muskeg) (Figure 2). The White Muskeg (Nil tale’ ghi’a), including Egg Lake (Egeze
1

|

' Tue) is a culturaI/sacred and ecological landscape of central importance to the health |
and well being of the Nation and traditional lands within the Km" Kos’ Deseh/Christina
River watershed, including the diverse boreal life forms that share these same lands.
Relevant contextual background information on the Nation and its traditional territory,
in general, and the Christina River (Kai Kos Deseh) watershed, in particular, is attached I
(Background).
While CPDFN understands that NGTL will be providing financial support for a more
comprehensive and detailed project-specific traditional use study and impact
assessment, a number of specific issues have already been broadly identified and
documented in the course of the Nation’s on-going traditional use and OCCUpancy
studies and investigations. CPDFN considers these specific issues to be highly relevant
to the proposed pipeline project and the regulatory process and warrant immediate
consideration.
Specific Issues - Nil tale’ ghi’a/White Muskeg
Traditional use studies carried out by Chipewyan Prairie Dene First Nation to date have

i consistently identified potential disturbance to the White Muskeg (Nil tale’ ghi’a) as a
matter of great concern for reasons which are related to the inextricable

’ interconnections between Dene people and the land (e.g. cultural heritage, language,
ecology, food, health and well being). Potential impacts to water (quality, quantity, and
connectivity) woodland caribou have been most particularly identified. ‘
As described by CPDFN elders, the White Muskeg (Nil tale’ ghi’a) is so named because of
the abundance of ”white moss” (lichen) which grows within a large low lying "basin
covered in muskeg.” Within this basin are the source waters of Christina (Kai K05 Deseh)
River which originate in the muskeg north of Egg Lake (Egeze Tue) and gradually trickle
and converge in a south-flowing stream which then winds its way north through Janvier
IR 194 (the main CPDFN reserve and settlement). Christina River (Kai’ Kos’ Deseh)
ultimately joins with the Clearwater and Athabasca rivers.

i K01" K05’ Deseh {Christina River) is the Nation’s water source. There are many ancient
stories told about the underground rivers which flow within the Kai K05 Deseh /Christina
River watershed (and beyond). The interconnections of these underground waters with
the muskegs and surface waters are understood to be integral to the sustenance of all
life forms sharing the lands within the watershed. Within Nil tale’ ghi’a/White Muskeg
the riparian areas along the Km" Kos’ Deseh/Chn'stina River are known to be particularly
rich in plant and animal medicines (foods) of importance to Dene peOples.
Woodland Caribou and Lynx are two animal species Specifically noted as belonging to
the lands within the White Muskeg (Nil tale’ ghi 0). Both are described as being
”touchy” in regard to human disturbance. Woodland caribou, a Dene cultural icon, is
acknowledged to be at risk of extirpation within the Kai Kos Deseh /Christina River

1 2

watershed as a result of mounting industrial activity. Nil tale’ ghi’a/White Muskeg is the
birthing ground for woodland caribou and important seasonal foraging area. The
longstanding presence of woodland caribou in Nil tale’ ghi’a/White Muskeg and their
unique habits are documented in the Nation’s ancestral and contemporary stories. Also
documented is the presence and former abundance of lynx, particularly in the Egg Lake
(Egeze Tue) area. Related concerns about increasing lynx habitat loss within the Kai Kos
Deseh /Christina River watershed have been identified.
Our preliminary discussion with the proponent in regard to woodland caribou
protection planning has been troubling. Depending on the outcomes of further in depth
discussions specific to woodland caribou protection in relation to the project’s proposed
routing through Nil tale’ ghi’a/White Muskeg and within the broader Kai Kos Deseh
/Christina River watershed, another letter of comment may be forthcoming.
Fish, the primary staple upon which the Nation is now forced to depend upon, are
known to travel up the Christina River to the Athabasca River and back. Within Nil tale’ i
ghi’a/White Muskeg there are ancestral and recent historical reports of the presence of
(food) fish in open waters which do not freeze over in winter. Given the unprecedented
and rapidly declining moose population within the Km" Kos Deseh/Christina River
watershed, protecting the quality and quantity of fish is a matter of the highest priority
for the health and well being of the Nation’s members. While a specific investigation of
arctic grayling (deemed sensitive) within Nil tale’ ghi’a/White Muskeg has not been
carried out, the longstanding presence of grayling in Kettle, House, and Christina rivers
has been recorded in traditional land use studies.
Despite environmental assessments which conclude that pipelines result in little or no
impact to the land, the Nation’s harvesters and elders are aware of evidence to the
contrary. Efforts are underway to consolidate information on instances where pipelines
believed to have resulted in the negatively changed water flows (quantity and quality)
that have been observed within the Km" Kos Deseh/Christina River watershed.
Moreover, based on recent and publicized local, regional, and international spill
incidents, accidents and malfunctions are very much a concern for the Nation. The
ramifications of such an occurrence within Nil tale’ ghi’a/White Muskeg are
disconcerting to the Nation's members, collectively and individually.
Overarching Concern - Ni! tale’ ghi’a/White Muskeg
It is important to note that although the issues outlined in the foregoing have been
presented as distinct and separate they are in fact inextricably connected components
of a much broader whole. In this regard, CPDFN’s overarching concern is for protection
of the integrity (intactness) of Ni! tale’ ghi’a/White Muskeg as a unique landscape which
is both culturally and ecologically significant.
Treaty and Aboriginal Rights

3

With the unprecedented scale, pace and intensity of oilsands developments within the
Kai’ K05 Deseh/Christina River watershed Chipewyan Prairie Dene First Nation is of
course very concerned about current and future abilities to exercise constitutionally
protected rights. The pending project-specific investigations which will be carried out by
CPDFN will consider these matters. In addition the study will augmenting the
preliminary information which has been provided in the foregoing and document the
Nation’s traditional use, occupancy, customs and practices relative to the proposed
project.
Yours truly,

CHIPEWYAN PRAIRIE DENE FIRST NATION
Background Document
We are a Déné’suh'ne people, a sub-group of the larger Déné Nation. Our people have
long occupied the northeastern boreal forest regions of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and
Manitoba. Chipewyan Prairie Déné First Nation traditional lands extend north of Tzi’
Gan Tue’ (McClelland Lake), east to Ejar As’ Tue’Aza’ (Peter Pond/Dillon Lake in
Saskatchewan; south to Tlu’ Cho Tue’ (Cold Lake), and west to The Na Eha Tue’ (Big Rock
Lake/Wabasca) (Figure 1).
Within this extensive territory, as documented in stories which have been passed down
orally through successive and countless generations, the ancestors of Chipewyan Prairie
Déné First Nation specifically selected the lands within the Kai’ Kos’ Deseh/Chn’stina
River watershed (Figures 1, 2) because they would sustain us in a future of co-existence
with non-Aboriginal newcomers to our land. Chipewyan Prairie Déné First Nation clan
families have continuously occupied the Kai’ Kos’ Deseh/Christina River watershed for
many generations; at least six generations are documented in living memory. The
archaeological record dates back thousands of years.
These lands, No Ha’ Nene, were chosen because fish, wildlife, berries and everything
else we needed as Déné people was in plentiful supply. We know our land intimately -
the animals, the birds, the fish, the plants, the trees and shrubs, as well as their habits
and habitats and the complexity of their inter-relationships. Our language reflects
knowledge of these relationships.
While all our traditional lands are important, the K01" K05’ Deseh/Chn'stina River
watershed is of particular significance to us because this is where our ancestors were
born, lived, and are buried; where our ancestral and current settlements, traplines and
sacred areas are located; where our harvesting needs, practices, patterns and
responsibilities have been passed down without interruption for generations; where our
stories, history, and language reside; and where an abundance of resources from the
waters and forests have consistently been available to sustain us physically, mentally,
and spiritually, despite concerted efforts over the past century to force us to abandon
our Déné ways and assimilate.
As Déné people, we have a sacred responsibility to care for and protect our land. We
are obliged to speak for our peeple today and for those yet unborn. We are also obliged
to speak for all the life forms sharing the land with us, for they cannot speak for
themselves. The land and Déné people are one. We were here long before industry
arrived and we intend on being here long after industry leaves.

Dear Ms. Erickson
Re: TransCanada’s NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (TransCanada)
Leismer to Kettle River Crossover Project (the Project)
File OF-Fac-Gas-N081-2010-15 01
I am writing you on behalf of the Métis community of Conklin, Alberta. The Métis of
Conklin satisfy all of the tests set by the Supreme Court of Canada in the Powley case
for determining the existence of an abo riginal rights-bearing Métis community. As such,
we possess communal aboriginal rights, which our members continue to practice in the
lands surrounding our community. The Conklin Métis Local #193 (CML#193) is the
rights-bearing body through which the Métis of the community share in these aboriginal
rights.
In the lands surrounding our community, our members continue to engage in practices
that have been integral to our culture since before the date of effective European
control. These include hunting, ﬁshing‘ and trapping for food, clothing and other
purposes; collecting berries and plants for food and medicinal purposes; and harvesting
timber for building and other uses. We actively pass the knowledge necessary to carry
on these practices to our children and grandchildren. as well as sharing with them those
parts of our lands that are of particular spiritual and cultural importance. Our traditional
lands continue to act as our grocery stores, pharmacies, home building centres,
schools, cultural centres, and churches.
The construction of the Project will disturb land in the area causing any animals to
migrate or leave the area entirely. Many plants will be disturbed and destroyed in the
new disturbance area and re-disturbed along the existing right of way. This will directly
affect the daily life of the community members who rely on these sources for food,
medicinal resources and other uses, thereupon infringing the rights of the members of
the Métis Local #193.

Conklin is at the centre of rapidIy-expanding development of extracting bitumen through
in situ technology. Eight different oil sands projects are either operating, being
developed, or are proposed within the immediate vicinity of our community. The impact
on our community from the combined (cumulative) effect of this development is already
dramatic, and is increasing at a tremendous rate. Those projects that have already been
announced will increase these impacts 14~fold in the next six years. Even prior to this
expansion, Conklin is already recognized as, after Fort McKay, as the Canadian
community most impacted by resource development. The cumulative effect of oil
development is not yet understood. .
The Conklin Métis Local #193 (CML#193) works together with the Conklin Community
Association (CCA) to provide an effective consultation process for the community of
Conklin to engage with resource developers that are impacting their community and
traditional lands. This process and partnership is called the Conklin Resource
DeveIOpment Advisory Committee (CRDAC). The mandate of the CRDAC is to create a
one-window of interface to ensure both the vested interests, needs and expectations of
the Conklin community. and the business objectives of industry and government are
addressed in a collaborative, efﬁcient, and constructive manner.
The CRDAC has been trying to work cooperatively with TransCanada since 2008. With
respect to this current project, TransCanada and the CRDAC met in September 2010 to
jointly develop an Action Plan to guide the consultation process and at that time, agreed
to establish and deﬁne the relationship between TransCanada and the CRDAC in the
form of an agreement that provides resources towards the administration of the CRDAC
process. Since then the CRDAC has, in good faith with a minimum amount of
resources, provided interface and an engagement process to TransCanada with the
understanding that an agreement would be reached. The CRDAC has been unable to
accomplish this task with TransCanada. Due to resources and capacity limitations, the .
CRDAC has now decided retain Ackroyd LLP to assist with negotiations. Ackroyd will be
taking over the responsibility of continuing to try to reach an agreement and secure the
resources required to move forward on the consultation action plan for the project. Until
resources are secured and TransCanada and the CRDAC move forward with
consultation. we cannot support this project. If you have any questions or require further
information, please contact our technical advisor, Bonnie Evans at (306) 481-4486 or by
email at bonnie.evans@sasktel.net.
Thanking you in advance. .

  Dear Ms. Randall
  Re: Leismer to l(ettle River Project
  May I take this opportunity to introduce myself I am the Headsman (Chit) of the Christina River
  Dene Nation CouncIl that has a signed up membership of 48 people of Aboriginal Ancestry from the
  conununity of ChardfJanvier South, A13.
 I am infonning NEB that Mr. Raoiil Montgrand is not recognized as ‘President” of: Chard Métis
 Local #214. This local has been struck off the Corpezratie Registration System -2011/12/02 due to not
  tiling any annual returns for over 3yesrs. I fully realize that Mr. Montgrand is himself a
 “Stakebolder”, therefore entitled to intervene, but to say he epresents the community that I live in is
 definitely not correct.
 More importantly there has not been adequate consultation with our community rcgardliig this
 project. If you review the 2010 Lesismer to Kettle River Crossover project, project description, you
 will note that NGTL met with the President of CML when the local was Active on July 7. The ue,t
 meeting was in October and November when NGTL again initiated discussions with a CML
      resentative. My question Is “who was this peison?’ NGTL should of initiated discussions with the
 community.
 I look forward to meeting NE representatives at the hearing scheduled to be held at the Chateau
 Nova, Fort McMurray on May 8, 2012
