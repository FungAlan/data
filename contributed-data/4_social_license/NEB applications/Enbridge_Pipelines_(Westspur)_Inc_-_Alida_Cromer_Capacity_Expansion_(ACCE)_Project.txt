PROJECT DESCRIPTION '

The proponent proposes to construct a 60 km long? 168.3 mm (6 inch) outside diameter pipeline
to transport natural gas liquids (NGL) from a terminal in Alida, Saskatchewan to a terminal in
Cromer, Manitoba. In addition, the proponent proposes to convert an existing, adj acent 324 mm
(12 inch) outside diameter pipeline from its current NGL service to crude oil service. A new 20
m Wide Right—«of—Way (ROW) is proposed for the 168.3 mm pipeline and. it would be located
adjacent to an existing 15 111 ROW which contains the 324 mm pipeline as well as a 432 mm .

_ MIGRATORY BIRDS

Environment Canada wishes to aclmowledge that the documentation is well organized and
written and addresses the potential pmj eet impacts to migratory bird species in a straight forward
manner. The consultant and proponent are to be commended for this work.

The documentatien' states that “Construction is preposed to begin in July 2007, once the
necessary regulatory approvals have been received ...”(V01ume II, Section 1.0 Introduction,
page 1-1). Environment Canada does not have any objection to construction proceeding during
the summer in cultivated areas where there is a low likelihood of breeding migratory birds.
However, to minimize potential impacts to breeding migratory birds, Environment Canada
recommends that construction take place outside the May 1 to July 31 time period in areas 0f
natural habitat Where migratory birch: may he nesting. Fer this prej eat, the proponent notes that
there are remnant areas of natural habitat along the proposed route; see, for example, Section 5.0
Existing Environmental Conditions, Table 5.22, page 5~37. Environment Canada advises that
these remam natural habitats can represent natural refugium for many migratory bird species.
For these areas Environment Canada recommends construction activities such as vegetation
clearing not take place until. August 1, 2007.

SPECIES AT RISK ACT (SARA)

Environment Canada Wishes to aelmowledge that this report is well organized and written and
addresses the potential project impacts to SARA listed. Species- in a straight forward manner. The
consultant and proponent are to be commended for this work.
The documentation indicates that vegetation and habitat ﬁeld surveys of the proj eet corridor
were undertaken. 0:: July 5 to 75 2006 andegain en. August 15 £9 17, 2006. In addition, a wildlife
and wildlife habitat survey of the» project corridor took place on July 5 to 7 , 2006. The surveys
include a listed species search for both provincial, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, and- federal
(SARA) listed species. ,

03/01/2007 THU 09:39 FAX 306 7806466 ENV CANADA «--me
There was a potential for eleven SARA listed species to be found along the proposed pipeline:
0 E ndangered --V piping plover and burrowing owl;
0 Threatened -- loggerhead Shrike and Sprague’s pipit;
0 Special Concern —— ferruginous hawk, yellow rail, short~eared owl, MoCowan’s
longspur, red~headed woodpecker, northern IeOpard frog, and monarch butterﬂy.
Monarch butterﬂies were the only SARA listed species to be observed on the ROW. The
monarch butterﬂy feeds on plants with bitter or poisonous sap, such as milkweed. The
consultant noted (V 01. II, Subsection 9.7.3.4 Species at Risk, page 9-32) that ‘Monarch
caterpillars were located on milkweed plants located off the ROW and adults were observed in
the proj ect region.” And that “Milkweed plants are present ontheproposed RQW’?’. .. . . . . . . . .. . .
The consultant concluded that disturbance to this listed species is anticipated to be limited to
local individuals within or immediately adj acent to the ROW during construction (Vol. II,
Subsection 9.7.3.4 Species at Risk, page 9-32). The impact would be short term during
construction and would be reversible. Environment Canada agrees with this assessment.
WETLANDS _ '
The report indicates that the project is expected to result in the disturbance of approximately 147
wetlands representing approximately 201121 of the ROW (Vol. II, Subsection 9.8.2 Wetlands

Values Environmental Components, page 9-3 8). Environment Canada accepts the proponent’s

position that it is not feasible to avoid every wetland basin encountered along the new ROW.

The documentation states that most of the wetlands- previously disturbed by the construction of

the existing pipelines appear to meetieh hydrotogically and ecologically and that disturbed

wetlands are indistinguishable from other types of wetlands that were not crossed by the existing
pipelines (Vol. II, Subsection 9.8.3 Impact Analysis, page 9—39, last paragraph). However, it is
not clear from the documentation how disturbance to wetlands might be mitigated.

Is it the intent of the proponent that Wetland mitigation would- oonsist of some form of natural

regeneration? Would wetland reclamation consist of natural recovery processes, or would

disturbed wetlands be re—contoured to their pre—construction proﬁle, for example?

Other rehabilitation measures that might be implemented could include:

0 Maintain wetland function -~ Supply and recharge areas should not be restricted in order to
avoid disrupting natural hydrology and consequently the function of the wetland basin or
complex.

a Maintaiﬂ continuity - Efforts could be made to keep surface water runoff ﬂowing
uninterrupted into the same basin or complex Where the water ﬂowed prior to the proj ect
disturbance. Slight alterations in wetland or adjacent drainage channel alignment may be
necessary but efforts should be made to keep these changes to a minimum so that ﬂow

pattems that local landowners, wildlife and ﬁsh have become accustomed to could be
restored as close as possible to existing conditions.

o Sediment and erosion control ~— Proper sediment and erosion control measures may need to

be implemented thmughout the disturbed area to prevent erasion and potential sediment

transport into wetland basins and adj acent watercourses.

En-bridge (W estspur) Pipelines
Alida to Cromer Capacity Expansion

F urther to our October 23, 2006 letter in which we identiﬁed a list of potential concerns about this
project, I want to advise that we have reviewed the application for Enbridge Pipelines (Westspur)
Inc.'s proposed __A1ida..to CromerCapacity ExpansioMACCE) Project which wasﬁled with the
Board on J anuary 17 and have the following comments.
As the expansion occurs on existing rights-«of-«way we do not have any speciﬁc wildlife or
vegetation concerns that stand out. The Crown Fish and Wildlife Development Fund (FWDF) land
that is impacted in SE l3—8-30—W1M has been inspected and no concerns were noted from this
project.
Our biggest concern is the number of creek and wetland crossings involved in the project. Enbridge
has indicated they will complete site speciﬁc mitigation for the wetlands as weather Will have an
impact on how all the affected areas will be crossed. Monitoring will play an important role as well.
It will be difﬁcult to predict the exact number of areas requiring'Aquatic Habitat Protection Permits,
however, we expect separate and more detailed applications Will be needed as the preferred method
identiﬁed for the majority of the crossings will be Open cut trenching.
While Saskatchewan is not a formal participant in the federal environmentalmassessment process
pursuant to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, Saskatchewan Environment wishes to

> remain involved in the environmental—assessment process, including ongoing notiﬁcations and
receipt of diocumentatien as it becames available.
