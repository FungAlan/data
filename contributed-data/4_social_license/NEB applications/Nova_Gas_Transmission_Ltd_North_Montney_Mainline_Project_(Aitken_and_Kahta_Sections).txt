 3.     The potential commercial impacts of the proposed Project.
7.     The appropriateness of the general route and land requirements for the proposed Project.
10. Potential impacts of the proposed Project on landowners and land use.
11. Contingency planning for spills, accidents or malfunctions, during construction and operation of the
       Project.
I live next door to a proposed compressor station and will be directly affected by the proposed road
allowance and facility so close by. We have lived here for many years and love it because it is quiet and rural.
 This station being proposed will affect our standard of living. The road is being proposed right out my back
window and the size of the compressor station will be very evident from my home. Being outside the
Dawson Creek protection area, we are not provided with emergency services if something should happen.
The visual impact, the noise, the traffic, the permanent facilities all play a role in my distaste for this project.
The use of farmland and the commercial traffic on our existing roadways is also a concern.

Black Swan Energy has more than 200 DSU's of Montney gas in the Aitken Creek area, with approximately 14
Tcf of resource potential on contiguous lands. The infrastructure and transportation currently available in the
area is insufficient to handle increased volumes of gas of this magnitude. This situation will severely limit our
growth potential, and has already impacted the rate at which we are developing our lands as we do not want
to drill wells that will be stranded. We are in the queue to take on processing and transportation capacity
within the framework of the existing infrastructure, but unless expansion occurs in the area our growth will
be limited.The proposed pipeline will provide transportation to access gas markets across North America, as
well as provide access to proposed LNG pipelines and terminals, allowing us to develop our lands in a socially,
economically and environmentally sound manner providing clean energy alternatives to consumers.
Black Swan is a private company with $500 MM equity line backed by Warburg Pincus, Canada Pension Plan
and Kern Partners. We have experienced management and have extablished sizeable positions in this
Montney play as well as a Duvernay play in central Alberta. We commenced drilling in February, 2012, had
first production by November 2012, and have drilled 18 wells.
We have focused most of our capital program on the Montney, with 13 Montney wells drilled in the Aitken
Creek area. We are planning a 1 rig continuous drilling program on a go forward basis, adding 12 wells a year.
Our results have been positive, and if sufficient infrastructure were to be in place to handle more volumes,
we could and would accelerate our drilling program through the use of 2 or 3 rigs.
We have a strong technical team who can execute a large scale program, and investors who are eager to
support a larger scale development of our Montney resource. We are only limited by access to infrastructure
and transportation to markets. Although expansion of existing gas plants or construction of new gas plants
will be required in the area to process increased gas volumes, this pipeline could address a large portion of
the transportation bottlenecks that exist in the area and are limiting growth. Black Swan Energy supports the
proposal by Nova Gas Transmission for the pipeline project as outlined in the application.

We are directly affected as we live within 500m of a proposed compressor station. Anyone anywhere near
projects of this magnitude are affected in one way or another. Our quiet, residential/rural area is being
threatened by a lot of industrial/commercial activity. Communication and timeliness from the proposing
company has not been very forthcoming (minimal along with non-truths) which leaves a bad impression
about things to come. Agricultural land will be destroyed, despite the benefit it offers, and the heavy traffic
will have negative impacts on the main road which already has a weak spot that constantly needs repair. We
are out of city limits for emergency response action. We will have to put up with the construction,
permanent eye sore facilities, noise, smells, traffic, etc. Before this even happens, we have to try to find the
time in our already busy days to research these projects, attend meetings, write letters and then enjoy the
benefit of increased prices for utilities. We are affected.

final argument. If the need to do so arises, Quicksilver will notify the Board.

Painted Pony Petroleum Ltd. ("Painted Pony") is a Canadian oil and gas exploration company trading on the
Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol "PPY".
As indicated in the Investors Information section of its website (http://PaintedPony.ca), Painted Pony issued
press releases dated March 4 and March 18 of 2014. Significant reported values include a 52% year-over-year
increase to December 31, 2013 in proved plus probable reserves to 1.7 Tcfe or 290.3 mmboe, and fourth
quarter 2013 production of 9,312 boe per day including 46.8 MMcfd of natural gas.
Painted Pony has a high working interest in a large contiguous asset base in the Montney area. Its lands are
located along an existing major pipeline route and are also along and adjacent to the pipeline route of the
proposed Project approximately between the proposed Altares and Blair Creek receipt points.
Additional pipeline capacity will be needed in B.C. to transport the anticipated throughput for existing and
new markets. Painted Pony is forecasting its own natural gas production to be approximately 500 MMcfd by
the end of 2018. Painted Pony wishes to express its views regarding the need, economic feasibility,
commercial aspects, tolling methodology, and recovery of costs for the Project.
For these reasons, Painted Pony considers itself to be directly affected by the proposed Project, has relevant
expertise in the subject of natural gas supply development, and wishes to be approved as a Commenter in
the proposed Project, File OF-Fac-Gas-N081-2013-10-02.

Limit your answer to no more than 500 words. You may attach additional pieces of paper if
required.

The proposed Groundbirch Compression station location SW 35-78-16-ws is
adjacent to my father's land. This is land that my grandparents purchased in
the 19405, that was passed on to my parents in the 1960’s, that I enjoyed
through my childhood and youth, and that my sons have come to know and love
when they visit. It is land that I will one day inherit.
Currently there are no buildings on my father’s quarter, but the property is
desirable for development as it is a peaceful piece of land with a beautiful

; panoramic view of Bear Mountain and Dawson Creek. It is virtually untouched

I by the outside world as the trafﬁc to the area is seasonal and limited to those

' farming in the immediate area. It has a very remote feel to it and yet it is only
about 6 36 miles from town. There is road access and electricity in close
proximity. A previous real estate appraisal valued this quarter more highly then
those adjacent due to these features.
If this compression Station is developed as planned, it will adversely affect the
value of this property. How can it not with 9 buildings, additional traffic, light
and noise pollution, and with the potential environmental and safety
hazards? Not only is there a personal and sentimental loss with the respect to
my own desire to build on the property, but there will be a ﬁnancial loss with
respect to resale value. While TransCanada and other oil companies will be
making a profit, the adjacent landowners and residents will be negatively
affected. Their rural lifestyle will be altered, their landscapes will be
permanently marred and beautiful agricultural land will be exploited.
In addition to concerns about loss of value of the surrounding land, I have safety
and environmental concerns. When it comes to industry, their priority is to
make ﬁnancial gain, it is not to protect the environment or take care of the
rights of the people. How will the water table, surrounding soil and air be .
affected during construction and operation of a compression station? What will
the environmental impact be in the event of a malfunction, spill or fire? How
will people of the area be notified in the event evacuation is required? How will
they know there isn’t someone out farming in one of the adjacent I
quarters? Will there be off site monitoring? What was once a gem for a family I
home and farm will be overshadowed by an industrial site and potential
environmental threats.

Attention: Sheri Young, Secretary of the Board.NationaI Energy Board
Dear National Energy Board Panel,
I am writing to request an extension for the application deadline to participate in the North Montney
project. The proposed location (SW 35-78-16-W6) for the Groundbirch compression station is adjacent
to one of my father’s 3 quarters.
The reason for my late application is multifaceted. While there have been a number of opportunities to
raise concerns, the timing of the stakeholder engagement couldn’t have been worse. My mother passed
away in July of 2013 and at that same time my father was moved into care. My sister Judith Templeton
has been acting in trust on behalf of my father since my mother’s death and has been focused on
settling my mother’s estate, managing the remaining aspects of the farm including a farm auction this
spring, and supporting my Father’s transition into care. It was not until December when she was
approached by TransCanada to purchase one of my father’s 3 quarters of land that this project became
known to me and our other 2 sisters.
In January, when there was no agreement for Tra nsCanada to purchase my fathers land for the
compression station, I understood that the primary site for development was to the West approximately
1 mile. Therefore, I thought my father’s land was unaffected by the development of the compressi0n
station and I did not pursue information any further. Additionally, I decided not to travel from
Coquitlam on short notice to attend the January 2014 meeting in Dawson Creek being that I believed his
property would not be d irectly affeCted.
It wasn't until my sister received a project update letter from TransCanada on March 17'" dated March
11‘", 2014 that I started to become very concerned about the development. It clearly stated that the
majority of the attendees from the January meeting preferred the location of SW 53-78-16-W6. It also
mentioned the deadline of March 19‘" for application to participate in the hearing. It was March 18‘”
when I received this information from my sister. I work full time and have 2 sons age 12 and 15 and as

‘ such there was no time for me to research and prepare an application for this process in 24 hours. I did

I n0t proceed with the application as I felt I was too late for me to meet the deadline.
As an alternative, I wrote a letter to Mr. Trout with the North Montney Mainline Project on March 26‘“
requesting information with respect to whether there were any restrictions in building within a certain
proximity to the compression station. I also voioed my concern that their project update letter came to
us 2 days before the deadline for application to participate in the hearing. A fair process would have
provided that information weeks before a deadline of this nature.
Following my e-mail to Mr. Trout, I had a telephone conference with TransCanada staff on about April
lst, received their e-mail response on April 22"“, e-mailed my concerns to ~68 on May 8'" and received a
response June 12‘". It was this June 12‘h response from the NEB that provided me with the information
as to how to proceed with a late consideration.

In light of my mother‘s death and the time it has taken to fully understand both how this project will
affect my father’s property and the process related to participating in this hea ring, I would request that
you please extend the deadline to pa rticipate and consider this application for facilities hearing for the
Groundbirch compressor station.

RE: Hearing Order GH-001-2014
NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (“NGTL”)
Application for North Montney Project (“Project")
Board File OF-Fac-Gas-NOB1-2013-10-02
Painted Pony Petroleum Ltd. Letter of Comment
Dear Ms. Young:
. Painted Pony Petroleum Ltd. ("Painted Pony") is a Canadian oil and gas exploration
company and submits this Letter of Comment pursuant to paragraph 2.3 of Hearing
Order GH-001-2014. ‘
Painted Pony has a high working interest in a large contiguous asset base in the
Montney area and its lands are located along the existing Fort Nelson Mainline of
Westcoast Energy Inc., doing business as Spectra Energy Transmission (“Westcoast”).
Painted Pony's lands are also along and adjacent to the pipeline route of the proposed
Project approximately between the proposed Altares and Blair Creek receipt points.
Painted Pony currently delivers approximately 1,900 e3m3/d of sales gas into the
Westcoast pipeline system at receipt points along the Fort Nelson Mainline and at the
McMahon Plant Outlet. By the end of 2018. available production is projected to be over
14.000 e3m3/d.
According to the attached Westcoast June 4, 2014 notiﬁcation posted on Westcoast's
website, there is no Available Capacity on Westcoast's Firm T-North Long Haul Service
for the path of the entire Fort Nelson Mainline to Station 2 and for the paths westbound
from McMahon Plant Outlet to Station 2 and Sunset Creek. and eastbound from
McMahon Plant Outlet to NOVA/Gordondaie. This means ﬁrm transportation is
completely contracted and a shipper currently requiring incremental ﬁrm capacity on
these paths must obtain it from other shippers willing to assign their unutilized ﬂn-n
capacity.

PETROLEUM LTD.
Painted Pony is concerned that this lack of availabie transportation capacity will hinder
access to natural gas markets. including LNG export as contemplated in NEB approved
LNG expon licences. For this reason. Painted Pony encourages the National Energy
Board to consider ail applications for new gas pipeline infrastructure which can provide a
- healthy competitive environment for development in northeast B.C. Painted Pony is
relying on the expertise of the National Energy Board to conduct its hearings with regard
for fair commercial arrangements and reasonable tolling methodologies for stakeholders. -
Yours truly.

File: OF-Fac-Gas-N081-2013-10 02
Dear National Energy Board,
The preposed Groundbirch Compressor station location SW 35-78-16-W6 is adjacent to my father’s land. This
is land that my grandparents purchased in the 19405, that was passed on to my parents in the 1960‘s, that i
enjoyed through my childhood and youth, and that my sons have come to know and love when they visit. It is
land that I will one day inherit.
Currently there are no buildings on my father’s quarter, but the property is desirable for development as it is a
peaceful piece of land with a beautiful panoramic view of Bear Mountain and Dawson Creek. it is virtually
untouched by the outside world as the trafﬁc to the area is seasonal and limited to those farming in the
immediate area. It has a very remote feel to it and yet it is only about 6 )6 miles from town. There is road
access and electricity in close proximity. A previous real estate appraisal valued this quarter more highly then
those adjacent due to these features.
if this compressor station is developed as planned, it will adversely affect the value of this propeny. How can it
not with 9 buildings, additional trafﬁc, light and noise pollution, and with the potential environmental and
safety hazards? Not only is there a personal and sentimental loss with the respect to my own desire to build
on the property, but there will be a financial loss with respect to resale value. While TransCanada and other
oil companies will be making a proﬁt, the adjacent landowners and residents will be negatively affected. Their
rural lifestyle will be altered, their landscapes will be permanently marred and beautiful agricultural land will
be exploited.
In addition to concerns about loss of value of the surrounding land, I have safety and environmental concerns.
When it comes to industry, their priority is to make financial gain, it is not to protect the environment or take
care of the rights of the people. How will the water table, surrounding soil and air be affected during
construction and operation of a compressor station? If adjacent quarters wanted to seek organic farming
certiﬁcation would they be denied by virtue of the vicinity of the compressor statlon? in a letter from
TransCanada dated July 7‘", 2014 it states there will be a suction scrubber present which will remove liquids
and particles from the gas prior to entering the compressor station. How will the by-product be stored,
transported and disposed of in an environmentally safe manner? What will the environmental impact be in the
event of a malfunction, spill or ﬁre? How will people of the area be notified in the event an evacuation is
required? How will they know there isn‘t someone out farming in one of the adjacent quarters? Will there be
off site monitoring? These are just a few questions that have yet to be answered.
The re is a proposal to twin an existing pipeline (NGTL Towerbirch Expansion Project), which would allow the
Groundbirch compressor station location to be further West to a more remote area with less impact on the
local populace. Subsequently, we heard the Groundbirch compressor station project would be proceeding as
Towerbirch Project has not yet been approved. This raises a further concern regarding the overall planning of
the many oil projects, and TransCanada‘s lack of consideration and seemingly low priority to minimize human,

agricultural, and environmental impact. Why would they continue to move forwa rd on two pla ns, which could
render the proposed location of the compressor station that has a higher human and agricultural impact ‘
unnecessary? Where is the due diligence on behalf of the environment and the public? It raises concerns about |
the competency and ability of the oil company to have a comprehensive plan to mitigate and minimize the
impact and risk to the maple and environment In the Peace River District. ‘
in the light of the many concerns raised we hope the National Energy Board will honour the following requests:

0 To delay the Groundbirch Compressor Station project until there is a decision on the Towerbirch
Project. If the Towerbirch Project should proceed, then alternative locations for the compressor
station can be explored. Locations which are removed from the general population and will have a
reduced impact on the surrounding land owners.

. To require that the location of the compressor station be centered in the middle of the property to
increase the distance between the station and neighbouring properties. This will provide a buffer to
reduce noise, smell, and light emitted from the station from all surrounding landowners.

0 To ensure the water table, surrounding soil and air will not be negatively Impacted during construction
and operation of the compressor station.

0 To ensure all by-products as a result of the compressor station will be stored, transported and disposed

' of in an environmentally safe manner.

. To require that mature trees are planted and maintained around the station to provide further visual
and noise buffer from the adjacent properties.

. To have local on~site baseline measures of air quality and acoustic conditions at various times of the
day and night taken prior to construction and following full operation of the compressor station.

0 To have a comprehensive safety plan that includes who will carry out the plan, how to evacuate
farmers cu rrently working in adjacent ﬁelds, and that TransCa nada is responsible for all costs |
associated with execution of the plan and restorative work that is required in the event of an
emergency.

0 To require that TranSCanada fully restore the land to pte-project status including removal ofall
underground structures and pipes and any contaminated material when the compressor station is no
longer required.

a To require payment be made to adjacent landowners compensating for the loss of value in their
pmperties (whether the compressor station is located as proposed or more remotely).

In closing, I strongly believe that the Groundbirch compressor station should not be approved for either

location (NE34c78-16-W6 or SW 35-78-16-W6) until the Towerbirch Project has been decided. Decisions made

for infrastructure of this nature where it not only impacts the current generation of landowners, but is sure to

impact generations to come should not be taken lightly. All other projects should be considered and evaluated

in connection. Every effort Should be made to mitigate that impact to the property owners and the

environment. Thank you for allowing me to comment on this project.

FEDERAL POLICY ON WETLAND CONSERVATION
GUIDANCE FOR APPLICATION AND llVIPLE/VIENTA TION IN ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT

The key policy objectives of the Federal Policy on Wetland Conservation (the Wetland Policy)
relevant to federal environmental assessment can be found in Strategy 2 Managing Wetlands on
Federal Lands and Waters and in Other Federal Programs. These include:

Commit all federal departments to the goal of no net loss of wetland functions (i) on federal

lands and waters, (ii) in areas affected by the implementation of federal programs where the

continuing loss or degradation of wetlands has reached critical levels, and (iii) where federal

activities affect wetlands designated as ecologically or socio-economically important to a

region. Due to local circumstances where wetland losses have been severe, in some areas no

further loss of any remaining wetland area may be deemed essential (Government of Canada

1991L
The Wetland Policy applies to federal departments addressing the potential loss of wetlands and
wetland functions. Projects and activities of the Government of Canada are subject to the Policy,
including those projects and activities considered under the Canadian Environmental Assessment
Act, 2012 (CEAA 2012) For projects on non-federal lands and waters, such losses are evaluated (1) in
terms of the scope of any federal permits, licenses, authorizations and other instruments under
federal jurisdiction which may be applicable, ﬂ (2) where the associated wetland functions
support areas of federal jurisdiction (for Environment Canada, for example, these include migratory
birds and species at risk). N.B. Although the Policy applies broadly to all wetlands in Canada, the
’no-net-Ioss of wetland functions’ goal of the Policy does not apply to wetlands in the absence of
federal jurisdiction as noted in (1) and (2) above.
The Wetland Policy is underpinned by a ’no net loss of wetland functions’ objective, and as such,
necessitates a consideration of all wetland functions which could be impacted. For Environment
Canada, functions of particular interest include those supporting migratory birds and species at risk.
To inform the applicability of the Wetland Policy, Environment Canada recommends that
proponents describe the natural processes of potentially impacted wetlands (physical, chemical, and
biological) and perform an assessment of the potential impacts and mitigation.
Hanson et al. (2008) ’Wetland Ecological Functions Assessment: An Overview of Approaches’
(httgzzzIgublications.gc.ca[site[archivee-
archived.htm|?ur|=htt|gzzzQublications.gc.ca[co|lectionSZCOIIection 2010(ecZCW69—5-497-eng.gdf)
should be reviewed before undertaking a wetland functions assessment.
The Wetland Policy is applied on a regional basis to reflect current conditions. The Policy applies to
natural, degraded, and artificial wetlands. In British Columbia, for example, the geograghic areas
where the documented continuing loss or degradation of wetlands has reached critical levels are
defined as:

0 Lower Mainland / Fraser Valley region

0 East Vancouver Island and Gulf Islands

0 Okanagan Valley

In British Columbia, wetlands designated as ecologically or socio-economically imgortant to a region
are defined as:

0 Areas of Continental or Regional Signiﬁcance to Waterfowl within the three Joint Venture

planning boundaries of British Columbia

0 Estuaries as identiﬁed by the Pacific Estuary Conservation Program

0 All eelgrass (Zostera subspecies) beds

0 Red— and blue-listed wetland ecological communities
With respect to the two definitions provided above, Environment Canada’s Canadian Wildlife
Service (Pacific and Yukon) will provide more detailed guidance to project proponents as and when
requested. It should also be noted that the Policy states that ’no further loss of any remaining
wetland area’ may be deemed essential in areas where wetland losses have been severe.
For a spatial representation of the areas described above, refer to Appendix I. For a list of the
mapped units, refer to Appendix II.
Three mitigation strategies should be used to achieve a no net loss of wetland functions for the
three situations identified above. In order of application, these strategies1 are:

(1 ) Avoidance of impacts;

(2) Minimization of unavoidable impacts; and,

(3) Compensation for unavoidable impacts.
Due in part to the broader wetland policy objective of promoting the conservation of Canada’s
wetland functions, now and in the future, and given the important role that wetlands play in
sustaining populations of migratory birds and SARA-listed species, in addition to the foregoing no
net loss considerations of the Wetland Policy, Environment Canada strongly recommends that
avoidance and minimization of impacts to ecological wetland functions be carefully considered in
project design.
It is important to note that application of the Wetland Policy is separate and distinct from a
significance evaluation under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012. The Wetland
Policy is based on a no net loss of wetland functions, whereas the significance evaluation under the
Act uses threshold-based criteria. The Wetland Policy applies to all wetland types, regardless of size;
to all impact types, whether small or large, short duration or long, or direct or indirect. Specifically,
the no net loss goal applies to the temporary loss of wetland functions. Monitoring programs need
to be sufficiently robust to ensure effective implementation of mitigation measures and successful
recovery of wetland functions.
The Wetland Policy applies to CEAA 2012 to the extent of the application of federal jurisdiction (see
(B) above). With reference to section 5 of CEAA 2012, the relevant sections for consideration
include 5(1)(a), 5(1) (b), and 5(2)(a). With relation to section 5(1)(a), there must be link between
1 For more information on the mitigation hierarchy, refer for example to the Federal Policy on Wetland Conservation Policy

Implementation Guide for Federal Land Managers (1996), available through the following web link:
htt9:[[www.ec.gc.ca[natureZdefault.asg?lang=En&n=132ADBFC-1&9arent=OC1743A2-4D49-4183-AC5F-lDE909D2FEBl

areas of federal jurisdiction as described under (B). It is recommended that Environment Canada’s
Operational Framework for Use of Conservation Allowances (htt9:[[www.ec.gc.ca[ee-
eaZdefault.asg?lang=En&n=DAB7DD13-1&9rintfu|Igage=true) also be reviewed in relation to
wetlands and other habitat types.
Environment Canada’s Canadian Wildlife Service recommends that a Wetland Compensation Plan
(WCP) be submitted with an Environmental Impact Statement for review in the environmental
assessment process. The WCP should, amongst other things:
i. Describe the baseline condition of the wetland ecological communities and functions the
Project would impact and the functions gained at the compensation site(s)
ii. Describe how the Project applied the mitigation hierarchy including efforts to avoid impacts,
and identify residual effects
iii. Describe the process of selecting proposed compensation site(s) and associated baseline
condition(s)
iv. Identify the compensation ratio
v. Identify the success criteria
vi. List the parties and responsibilities for implementation
vii. Provide the monitoring schedule, parameters, plans, and analysis
At a minimum, a compensation ratio of 2:1 is used; however, this ratio varies on a project-by-project
basis. Consultation with the Canadian Wildlife Service is recommended to ensure the appropriate
ratio is identified. In order of priority, the Canadian Wildlife service recommends wetland
restoration over enhancement and enhancement over creation.
In summary, Environment Canada advises proponents that the Wetland Policy applies to all federal
departments and agencies when addressing the loss of wetlands. It will be used to inform the
environmental assessment process and will be considered by Environment Canada when assessing
the appropriate measures to be taken to mitigate the adverse environmental effects of the Project
under CEAA 2012, the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, the Migratory Birds Convention Act,
the International River Improvements Act and the Species at Risk Act.
It is important to note that the identification of ecologically important wetlands and areas where
losses of wetlands have reached critical levels is ongoing. As more data is made available and
analyzed, the advice and associated mapping will be periodically updated to ensure that the
Wetland Policy is implemented in a consistent and transparent manner.

Dear	  Ms.	  Sheri	  Young	  
October	  19th	  of	  2013	  my	  family	  first	  became	  involved	  with	  the	  stressful	  situation	  of	  
dealing	  with	  TransCanada/Nova	  Gas	  and	  the	  compressor	  station	  that	  they	  have	  proposed	  
to	  construct	  as	  part	  of	  the	  North	  Montney	  mainline	  project.	  	  The	  compressor	  station	  being	  
referred	  to	  in	  this	  letter	  is	  their	  option	  A	  at	  NE	  34-­‐78-­‐16-­‐W6.	  	  If	  approved,	  we	  feel	  that	  this	  
will	  have	  a	  very	  negative	  impact	  to	  the	  surrounding	  environment	  and	  the	  residents	  that	  
live	  here.	  	  We	  are	  directly	  affected	  by	  this	  facility	  since	  we	  are	  in	  clear	  view	  and	  close	  
proximity	  of	  the	  proposed	  access	  road	  and	  building	  site.	  	  We	  strongly	  oppose	  this	  
compressor	  station	  at	  this	  location.	  	  	  	  
After	  the	  initial	  contact	  from	  the	  land	  agent	  on	  October	  19th,	  I	  began	  inquiring	  about	  the	  
North	  Montney	  mainline,	  the	  timeline,	  who	  was	  involved,	  where	  facilities	  were	  being	  
proposed,	  how	  informed	  our	  community	  was	  regarding	  the	  project,	  etc.	  	  During	  the	  
summer	  of	  2013	  the	  North	  Montney	  project	  was	  being	  presented	  to	  councils	  and	  
stakeholders	  in	  the	  Peace	  region.	  	  This	  original	  proposal	  included	  the	  pipeline	  and	  two	  
compressor	  stations,	  the	  Aitken	  and	  the	  Saturn,	  which	  are	  basically	  out	  in	  the	  middle	  of	  
nowhere,	  with	  no	  persons	  being	  directly	  affected	  by	  the	  operations.	  	  Open	  houses	  were	  
announced	  and	  advertised	  in	  July	  of	  2013	  for	  Ft.	  St	  John,	  Chetwynd	  and	  Hudson’s	  Hope	  (not	  
Dawson	  Creek),	  to	  be	  held	  later	  in	  August.	  	  The	  open	  house	  dates	  came	  and	  went,	  and	  
following	  in	  September	  an	  updated	  North	  Montney	  fact	  sheet	  came	  out.	  	  This	  sheet	  was	  
very	  similar	  to	  the	  original	  except	  there	  was	  an	  addition	  of	  a	  new	  triangle	  on	  their	  map	  –	  
the	  Groundbirch	  compressor	  station	  –	  the	  largest	  of	  the	  three	  at	  33MW	  at	  the	  time,	  and	  the	  
one	  closest	  to	  many	  people.	  	  My	  family	  was	  approached	  on	  October	  19th,	  2013	  with	  a	  very	  
vague	  package	  of	  information	  regarding	  a	  compressor	  station	  being	  proposed	  to	  the	  
neighborhood.	  	  This	  was	  the	  FIRST	  day	  we	  had	  heard	  anything	  about	  the	  project.	  	  We	  were	  
not	  informed	  about	  the	  size	  of	  the	  facility	  or	  any	  details	  regarding	  its	  construction	  or	  
operation.	  	  On	  Nov.	  8th,	  TransCanada	  made	  application	  to	  the	  NEB	  for	  the	  pipeline	  and	  all	  
three	  stations.	  	  As	  residents,	  many	  questions	  were	  raised	  about	  why	  the	  other	  two	  
compressor	  stations	  got	  so	  much	  attention	  and	  advertising,	  lots	  of	  notice	  for	  open	  houses,	  
and	  plenty	  of	  time	  before	  TransCanada	  made	  application	  to	  the	  NEB.	  	  This	  third	  
compressor	  station	  seemed	  to	  have	  all	  of	  a	  sudden	  appeared,	  secretly	  on	  an	  updated	  fact	  
sheet	  that	  most	  people	  would	  have	  tossed	  because	  it	  looked	  so	  much	  like	  the	  original,	  
except	  for	  a	  small	  triangle	  on	  their	  map.	  	  Why	  were	  we	  not	  notified	  sooner	  than	  October	  
 19th?	  	  Considering	  this	  station	  will	  have	  the	  largest	  affect	  on	  people	  and	  is	  the	  closest	  to	  the	  
city	  of	  Dawson	  Creek,	  does	  it	  not	  deserve	  MORE	  public	  consultation	  and	  time	  for	  busy	  
people	  to	  translate	  into	  layman’s	  terms	  and	  absorb	  all	  of	  the	  information	  required	  to	  
understand	  the	  full	  scope	  of	  the	  project?	  	  Why	  can	  TransCanada	  even	  apply	  for	  the	  
construction	  of	  this	  facility	  BEFORE	  proper	  public	  consultation/notification	  had	  occurred?	  	  
When	  the	  residents	  of	  Dawson	  Creek	  finally	  got	  notification	  about	  the	  January	  28,	  2014	  
open	  house,	  it	  was	  less	  than	  a	  week	  before	  it	  was	  to	  happen.	  	  In	  our	  opinion,	  this	  whole	  
process	  was	  not	  well	  executed	  by	  TransCanada,	  the	  vagueness,	  the	  non-­‐truths,	  and	  the	  
inappropriate,	  rushed	  timeline	  for	  delivery	  of	  information,	  considering	  it	  will	  have	  the	  
largest	  impact	  with	  respect	  to	  community	  and	  residents.	  	  For	  a	  company	  who	  boasts	  
communication	  with	  stakeholders	  and	  community,	  I	  have	  to	  say	  that	  their	  efforts	  in	  this	  
case	  have	  been	  less	  than	  ideal.	  	  	  We	  are	  now	  faced	  with	  further	  worries	  about	  what	  is	  yet	  to	  
come,	  how	  forthcoming	  TransCanada/Nova	  Gas	  will	  be	  in	  the	  future	  about	  this	  facility	  and	  
the	  feeling	  of	  uncertainty	  regarding	  future	  developments.	  	  	  	  
My	  family	  has	  been	  on	  this	  property,	  happily	  and	  peacefully	  for	  40	  years.	  	  When	  oil	  and	  gas	  
companies	  began	  moving	  into	  the	  area,	  we	  have	  since	  seen	  and	  heard	  dramatic	  changes	  as	  
a	  result.	  	  None	  of	  which	  have	  had	  a	  positive	  impact	  on	  us.	  	  I	  do	  want	  to	  make	  it	  clear	  that	  we	  
are	  not	  opposed	  to	  oil	  and	  gas	  activity	  and	  understand	  the	  economic	  benefits	  that	  this	  will	  
bring	  to	  citizens	  as	  a	  whole,	  HOWEVER,	  we	  do	  have	  a	  problem	  with	  all	  of	  it	  when	  it	  is	  
forced	  upon	  us	  too	  close	  to	  home,	  like	  NE	  34-­‐78-­‐16-­‐W6	  could	  possibly	  be.	  	  Unless	  you	  live	  
in	  an	  area	  that	  offers	  the	  peace	  and	  quiet	  that	  we	  choose	  .	  .	  .	  you	  really	  can’t	  appreciate	  it.	  
Given	  that	  agriculture	  is	  still	  one	  of	  the	  largest	  resource	  sectors	  in	  the	  province	  of	  BC,	  it	  
must	  play	  a	  significant	  and	  important	  role	  in	  the	  provincial	  economy	  as	  far	  as	  GDP	  and	  job	  
creation	  goes.	  	  This	  quarter	  section	  is	  being	  threatened	  with	  an	  access	  road	  through	  the	  
center	  of	  it	  in	  addition	  to	  the	  compressor	  station	  facility.	  	  The	  idea	  of	  ruining	  any	  good	  
farmland	  is	  disturbing.	  	  Running	  a	  pipeline	  underground	  is	  one	  thing,	  at	  least	  we	  can’t	  see	  it,	  
hear	  it	  or	  smell	  it	  and	  the	  land	  is	  still	  fully	  functional.	  	  An	  access	  road	  and	  compressor	  
station	  will	  be	  exactly	  the	  opposite.	  	  It	  is	  unfortunate	  when	  landowners	  (particularly	  those	  
who	  don’t	  live	  in	  close	  proximity	  to	  proposed	  infrastructure),	  oil	  and	  gas	  companies	  and	  
government	  only	  see	  dollar	  signs	  and	  don’t	  think	  about	  or	  perhaps	  don’t	  care	  about	  the	  
actual	  people/property	  that	  will	  ultimately	  have	  to	  live	  with	  the	  final	  results	  for	  years	  to	  
come.	  	  We	  don’t	  see	  any	  profit	  or	  compensation,	  we	  are	  simply	  stuck	  with	  what	  we	  get	  AND	  
as	  an	  added	  bonus,	  we	  also	  get	  to	  pay	  higher	  utility/gas	  prices!	  	  	  	  	  	  
We	  strongly	  feel	  that	  the	  physical	  location	  of	  this	  first	  proposal	  site,	  NE	  34-­‐78-­‐16-­‐W6	  is	  
very	  inappropriate.	  	  The	  suggested	  footprint	  is	  on	  the	  highest	  point	  of	  a	  large	  open	  quarter	  
section	  with	  nothing	  around	  to	  protect	  the	  residents	  from	  the	  sights	  and	  sounds	  that	  will	  
come	  from	  this	  station	  -­‐	  sights	  and	  sounds	  that	  no	  one	  wants.	  	  Although	  easy	  for	  
TransCanada	  to	  move	  in	  and	  build	  on	  it,	  the	  infrastructure	  will	  be	  an	  intrusive,	  hideous	  
monstrosity	  to	  our	  beautiful,	  scenic	  countryside	  that	  has	  a	  view	  of	  our	  city!	  	  With	  respect	  to	  
real	  estate,	  inevitably,	  whether	  one	  wants	  to	  believe	  it	  or	  not,	  we	  feel	  strongly	  that	  this	  
facility	  will	  lower	  the	  value	  of	  surrounding	  property.	  	  We	  certainly	  would	  not	  want	  to	  move	  
in	  beside	  this	  proposed	  eyesore,	  just	  as	  much	  as	  we	  don’t	  want	  one	  to	  move	  in	  beside	  us.	  	  
 My	  family	  loves	  the	  outdoors	  and	  the	  tranquility	  that	  this	  rural	  area	  gives	  us.	  	  That’s	  why,	  
as	  Canadian	  citizens	  with	  the	  rights	  and	  freedoms	  that	  we	  have,	  choose	  to	  live	  here.	  	  	  
Having	  a	  compressor	  station	  at	  this	  proposed	  location	  will	  have	  a	  negative	  impact	  on	  our	  
outdoor	  activities	  in	  that	  we	  would	  have	  to	  limit	  our	  access	  near	  and	  around	  the	  area.	  Our	  
family	  has	  a	  cabin	  that	  is	  used	  year	  round	  for	  our	  outdoor	  recreational	  activities	  and	  it	  is	  
about	  500m	  from	  the	  first	  proposal	  sight.	  	  We	  enjoy	  riding	  all	  terrain	  vehicles	  and	  
snowmobiles,	  horseback	  riding,	  hunting,	  camping	  and	  peaceful	  evening	  walks,	  to	  name	  a	  
few.	  	  	  If	  this	  option	  A	  goes	  ahead,	  our	  cabin	  will	  be	  greatly	  disturbed	  by	  construction	  and	  
operation	  activities.	  	  	  We	  will	  no	  longer	  be	  able	  to	  wake	  up	  in	  the	  morning	  to	  a	  quiet,	  
beautiful	  view	  of	  the	  open	  countryside.	  	  Instead	  we	  will	  be	  forced	  to	  look	  at	  a	  mass	  of	  metal	  
and	  concrete	  and	  listen	  to	  the	  constant	  drone	  of	  generators	  or	  turbines.	  	  	  
	  
This	  is	  the	  view	  from	  our	  family	  cabin.	  	  The	  19m	  tall	  station	  is	  planned	  for	  the	  top	  left	  of	  the	  photo	  on	  the	  
peak	  of	  the	  hill.	  	  	  
In	  addition,	  we	  are	  concerned	  about	  the	  noise	  that	  will	  come	  from	  the	  construction	  and	  
operation	  of	  this	  facility.	  	  We	  are	  not	  convinced	  by	  the	  comments	  we	  have	  heard,	  “you	  
won’t	  even	  notice	  it”	  or	  “it’ll	  be	  the	  same	  as	  your	  dishwasher”.	  	  There	  have	  been	  no	  baseline	  
tests	  for	  ambient	  noise	  done	  in	  this	  area	  and	  information	  in	  the	  reports	  was	  based	  on	  the	  
research	  conducted	  by	  the	  Environment	  Council	  of	  Alberta	  for	  average	  rural	  activity.	  	  
Perhaps	  average	  rural	  activity	  in	  BC	  is	  different.	  	  We	  cannot	  reiterate	  enough	  how	  much	  we	  
enjoy	  the	  peacefulness	  of	  where	  we	  live.	  	  ANY	  noise	  will	  be	  heard	  and	  will	  be	  an	  annoyance.	  	  	  
The	  air	  quality	  and	  potential	  health	  effects	  for	  those	  particularly	  susceptible	  are	  also	  a	  
concern	  for	  us.	  	  The	  population	  in	  proximity	  to	  this	  station	  ranges	  from	  young	  children	  to	  
senior	  citizens.	  	  Recent	  research	  has	  been	  put	  out	  specifically	  regarding	  the	  Northeast	  area	  
 of	  BC	  and	  how	  oil	  and	  gas	  activity	  is	  cause	  for	  concern	  where	  children	  and	  seniors	  are	  
involved.	  	  Why	  would	  we	  be	  in	  favor	  of	  putting	  our	  health,	  particularly	  our	  own	  children’s	  
health	  in	  jeopardy?	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
We	  also	  have	  concerns	  regarding	  the	  contingency	  planning	  in	  case	  of	  an	  emergency	  
situation.	  	  TransCanada	  has	  said	  to	  us	  that	  they	  have	  people	  on	  staff	  who	  will	  be	  monitoring	  
the	  location	  and	  in	  the	  event	  of	  an	  emergency,	  they	  have	  a	  plan	  in	  place	  to	  deal	  with	  any	  
given	  situation.	  They	  have	  also	  stated	  that	  they	  will	  work	  closely	  with	  local	  emergency	  
responders	  to	  ensure	  a	  coordinated	  response.	  	  The	  proposed	  site	  at	  NE	  34-­‐78-­‐16-­‐W6,	  is	  
OUTSIDE	  the	  fire	  protection	  area	  for	  Dawson	  Creek.	  	  We	  are	  NOT	  satisfied	  with	  what	  we	  
have	  been	  told	  thus	  far	  about	  their	  emergency	  response	  plan	  and	  prior	  to	  any	  approval	  
would	  like	  much	  more	  clarification	  regarding	  this	  issue.	  	  In	  the	  event	  of	  a	  fire	  for	  instance,	  
who	  are	  the	  ‘local’	  emergency	  responders,	  WILL	  the	  city	  of	  Dawson	  Creek	  be	  called	  and	  
actually	  come	  out	  beyond	  their	  boundaries	  to	  deal	  with	  a	  potential	  situation	  and	  what	  sort	  
of	  coverage/insurance/compensation	  is	  there,	  if	  TransCanada’s	  compressor	  station	  burns	  
my	  house	  down?	  	  	  
Since	  the	  day	  that	  this	  facility	  came	  to	  our	  attention,	  we	  have	  spent	  hours	  writing	  letters,	  
making	  phone	  calls	  trying	  to	  get	  as	  much	  information	  about	  what	  is	  going	  on	  as	  possible.	  	  
There	  has	  been	  a	  noticeable	  increase	  in	  anxiety	  and	  stress	  within	  our	  family	  and	  
community	  over	  this	  project.	  	  This	  has	  been	  and	  should	  continue	  to	  predominantly	  be	  a	  
rural/farming,	  residential	  area.	  	  Commercial/industrial	  activity	  needs	  to	  be	  kept	  to	  a	  
minimum	  and	  as	  far	  away	  from	  as	  many	  people	  as	  possible.	  	  	  
Seeing	  the	  long	  list	  of	  participants	  for	  the	  upcoming	  hearing,	  we	  feel	  lost	  in	  a	  crowd	  of	  
industry.	  	  We	  are	  busy,	  hardworking	  Canadians	  just	  trying	  to	  provide	  a	  nice	  life	  for	  our	  
families.	  	  	  We	  can’t	  afford	  legal	  advice	  or	  council,	  we	  have	  very	  little	  time	  to	  deal	  with	  or	  try	  
to	  understand	  all	  of	  the	  specific,	  technical,	  legal	  jargon	  that	  has	  been	  presented	  to	  us	  
regarding	  this	  project.	  	  We	  care	  about	  the	  area	  in	  which	  we	  live	  and	  are	  doing	  our	  best	  to	  
preserve	  its	  integrity.	  	  When	  considering	  the	  list	  of	  applicants	  to	  participate	  in	  this	  hearing,	  
we	  are	  the	  only	  residents	  that	  live	  beside	  the	  first	  proposal	  site	  and	  in	  writing	  this	  letter	  we	  
can	  only	  hope	  to	  gain	  an	  empathetic	  thought.	  	  We	  believe	  that	  the	  statements	  made	  should	  
hold	  much	  weight	  during	  the	  decision-­‐making	  process	  regarding	  where	  this	  Groundbirch	  
compressor	  station	  be	  located.	  	  Assuming	  a	  more	  suitable	  location	  is	  chosen	  for	  this	  facility	  
we	  would	  expect	  the	  following	  conditions	  to	  be	  met	  by	  TransCanada/Nova	  Gas.	  	  The	  
conditions	  include	  but	  are	  not	  limited	  to:	  
That	  EVERY	  stringent	  effort	  is	  made	  to	  minimize	  the	  effects	  of	  this	  compressor	  station	  with	  
respect	  to	  sights,	  sounds	  and	  smells	  and	  that	  TransCanada	  be	  diligent	  in	  their	  
communication	  with	  residents	  before,	  during	  and	  after	  construction.	  	  	  
Field	  data	  to	  characterize	  the	  actual	  baseline	  acoustic	  conditions	  at	  the	  Groundbirch

Consideration	  is	  made	  to	  involve	  Dawson	  Creek	  businesses,	  commercial	  trades	  to	  
hospitality,	  as	  much	  as	  possible	  for	  the	  duration	  of	  the	  project.	  	  	  
As	  a	  general	  comment,	  we	  believe	  that	  with	  the	  increasing	  activity	  for	  oil	  and	  gas	  in	  our	  
province,	  there	  needs	  to	  be	  more	  consideration	  taken	  when	  deciding	  on	  the	  location	  for	  
new	  pipelines,	  facilities,	  wells,	  etc.	  and	  the	  proximity	  to	  residents	  and	  residential	  areas.	  	  
Better	  restrictions	  and	  regulations	  must	  be	  in	  place	  with	  regards	  to	  the	  proximity	  of	  
facilities	  to	  residents	  and	  residential	  areas,	  particularly	  those	  who	  want	  nothing	  to	  do	  with	  
these	  projects.	  	  
In	  closing,	  we,	  the	  residents	  of	  3711	  –	  212	  Rd	  Dawson	  Creek	  BC	  (Kathy,	  David,	  Sarah,	  Bailey,	  
John	  and	  Vicky)	  feel	  very	  strongly	  that	  the	  access	  road	  and	  compressor	  station	  being	  
proposed	  at	  NE	  34-­‐78-­‐16-­‐W6	  should	  NOT	  be	  approved.	  	  The	  location	  is	  inappropriate	  and	  
the	  effects	  that	  it	  will	  have	  during	  construction	  and	  operation	  will	  not	  only	  be	  stressful	  but	  
will	  bring	  with	  it	  an	  eyesore	  and	  unwelcome	  disturbances.	  	  Health	  concerns	  are	  raised	  and	  
property	  values	  will	  fall.	  	  Perfectly	  good	  growing	  land	  should	  NOT	  be	  used	  and	  rural	  
residential	  land	  should	  not	  be	  forced	  commercial/industrial.	  	  This	  station	  will	  provide	  
everything	  that	  we,	  as	  rural	  residents	  do	  not	  want	  and	  will	  limit	  what	  we	  currently	  are	  able	  
to	  do	  and	  enjoy.	  	  When	  given	  an	  alternate	  location	  that	  is	  better	  protected	  with	  existing	  
trees	  and	  berms	  to	  try	  and	  mask	  the	  industrial	  look	  and	  sound,	  we	  would	  obviously	  prefer	  
this.	  	  TransCanada	  representatives	  have	  said	  verbally	  and	  via	  written	  correspondence	  that	  
the	  NE	  34-­‐78-­‐16-­‐W6	  location	  for	  the	  proposed	  compressor	  station	  is	  NOT	  a	  preferred	  
location.	  	  We	  couldn’t	  agree	  more.	  	  	  
We	  will	  continue	  to	  try	  and	  stay	  informed	  about	  the	  process	  and	  the	  upcoming	  hearing.	  	  We

Dear Ms. Young:
Black Swan Energy is a Canadian oil and gas exploration company and submits this Letter of
Comment pursuant to paragraph 2.3 of Hearing Order GH-001-2014.
Black Swan Energy has more than 200 DSUs of Montney gas in the Aitken Creek area, with
approximately 14 Tcf of resource potential. We currently produce in excess of 560 e3m3/d
which flows through Black Swan Energy owned and operated infrastructure onto the Spectra
Energy pipeline system. We have plans to increase production to 2400 e3m3/d by the end of
2016 through construction of a new processing facility and will require additional
transportation to deliver the gas to market.
Existing pipeline infrastructure in the area is fully contracted and will only allow incremental
volumes to flow on an interruptible basis. Black Swan Energy is concerned that the lack of
transportation capacity will limit our access to gas markets both in North America and to the
proposed LNG projects on the west coast of Canada. This, in turn, would delay, or perhaps even
prevent, our plans to develop our land.
Black Swan Energy is a private company with $ 500 MM equity line backed by CPPIB, KERN
Partners and Warburg Pincus. We have experienced management, a strong technical team who
can execute a large scale program, and investors who are eager to support development of our
Montney resource. The proposed pipeline will address an existing bottleneck, allowing for
further growth and development in northern British Columbia by providing access to North

FEDERAL POLICY ON WETLAND CONSERVATION
GUIDANCE FOR APPLICATION AND llVIPLE/VIENTA TION IN ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT

The key policy objectives of the Federal Policy on Wetland Conservation (the Wetland Policy)
relevant to federal environmental assessment can be found in Strategy 2 Managing Wetlands on
Federal Lands and Waters and in Other Federal Programs. These include:

Commit all federal departments to the goal of no net loss of wetland functions (i) on federal

lands and waters, (ii) in areas affected by the implementation of federal programs where the

continuing loss or degradation of wetlands has reached critical levels, and (iii) where federal

activities affect wetlands designated as ecologically or socio-economically important to a

region. Due to local circumstances where wetland losses have been severe, in some areas no

further loss of any remaining wetland area may be deemed essential (Government of Canada

1991L
The Wetland Policy applies to federal departments addressing the potential loss of wetlands and
wetland functions. Projects and activities of the Government of Canada are subject to the Policy,
including those projects and activities considered under the Canadian Environmental Assessment
Act, 2012 (CEAA 2012) For projects on non-federal lands and waters, such losses are evaluated (1) in
terms of the scope of any federal permits, licenses, authorizations and other instruments under
federal jurisdiction which may be applicable, ﬂ (2) where the associated wetland functions
support areas of federal jurisdiction (for Environment Canada, for example, these include migratory
birds and species at risk). N.B. Although the Policy applies broadly to all wetlands in Canada, the
’no-net-Ioss of wetland functions’ goal of the Policy does not apply to wetlands in the absence of
federal jurisdiction as noted in (1) and (2) above.
The Wetland Policy is underpinned by a ’no net loss of wetland functions’ objective, and as such,
necessitates a consideration of all wetland functions which could be impacted. For Environment
Canada, functions of particular interest include those supporting migratory birds and species at risk.
To inform the applicability of the Wetland Policy, Environment Canada recommends that
proponents describe the natural processes of potentially impacted wetlands (physical, chemical, and
biological) and perform an assessment of the potential impacts and mitigation.
Hanson et al. (2008) ’Wetland Ecological Functions Assessment: An Overview of Approaches’
(httgzzzIgublications.gc.ca[site[archivee-
archived.htm|?ur|=htt|gzzzQublications.gc.ca[co|lectionSZCOIIection 2010(ecZCW69—5-497-eng.gdf)
should be reviewed before undertaking a wetland functions assessment.
The Wetland Policy is applied on a regional basis to reflect current conditions. The Policy applies to
natural, degraded, and artificial wetlands. In British Columbia, for example, the geograghic areas
where the documented continuing loss or degradation of wetlands has reached critical levels are
defined as:

0 Lower Mainland / Fraser Valley region

0 East Vancouver Island and Gulf Islands

0 Okanagan Valley

In British Columbia, wetlands designated as ecologically or socio-economically imgortant to a region
are defined as:

0 Areas of Continental or Regional Signiﬁcance to Waterfowl within the three Joint Venture

planning boundaries of British Columbia

0 Estuaries as identiﬁed by the Pacific Estuary Conservation Program

0 All eelgrass (Zostera subspecies) beds

0 Red— and blue-listed wetland ecological communities
With respect to the two definitions provided above, Environment Canada’s Canadian Wildlife
Service (Pacific and Yukon) will provide more detailed guidance to project proponents as and when
requested. It should also be noted that the Policy states that ’no further loss of any remaining
wetland area’ may be deemed essential in areas where wetland losses have been severe.
For a spatial representation of the areas described above, refer to Appendix I. For a list of the
mapped units, refer to Appendix II.
Three mitigation strategies should be used to achieve a no net loss of wetland functions for the
three situations identified above. In order of application, these strategies1 are:

(1 ) Avoidance of impacts;

(2) Minimization of unavoidable impacts; and,

(3) Compensation for unavoidable impacts.
Due in part to the broader wetland policy objective of promoting the conservation of Canada’s
wetland functions, now and in the future, and given the important role that wetlands play in
sustaining populations of migratory birds and SARA-listed species, in addition to the foregoing no
net loss considerations of the Wetland Policy, Environment Canada strongly recommends that
avoidance and minimization of impacts to ecological wetland functions be carefully considered in
project design.
It is important to note that application of the Wetland Policy is separate and distinct from a
significance evaluation under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012. The Wetland
Policy is based on a no net loss of wetland functions, whereas the significance evaluation under the
Act uses threshold-based criteria. The Wetland Policy applies to all wetland types, regardless of size;
to all impact types, whether small or large, short duration or long, or direct or indirect. Specifically,
the no net loss goal applies to the temporary loss of wetland functions. Monitoring programs need
to be sufficiently robust to ensure effective implementation of mitigation measures and successful
recovery of wetland functions.
The Wetland Policy applies to CEAA 2012 to the extent of the application of federal jurisdiction (see
(B) above). With reference to section 5 of CEAA 2012, the relevant sections for consideration
include 5(1)(a), 5(1) (b), and 5(2)(a). With relation to section 5(1)(a), there must be link between
1 For more information on the mitigation hierarchy, refer for example to the Federal Policy on Wetland Conservation Policy

Implementation Guide for Federal Land Managers (1996), available through the following web link:
htt9:[[www.ec.gc.ca[natureZdefault.asg?lang=En&n=132ADBFC-1&9arent=OC1743A2-4D49-4183-AC5F-lDE909D2FEBl

areas of federal jurisdiction as described under (B). It is recommended that Environment Canada’s
Operational Framework for Use of Conservation Allowances (htt9:[[www.ec.gc.ca[ee-
eaZdefault.asg?lang=En&n=DAB7DD13-1&9rintfu|Igage=true) also be reviewed in relation to
wetlands and other habitat types.
Environment Canada’s Canadian Wildlife Service recommends that a Wetland Compensation Plan
(WCP) be submitted with an Environmental Impact Statement for review in the environmental
assessment process. The WCP should, amongst other things:
i. Describe the baseline condition of the wetland ecological communities and functions the
Project would impact and the functions gained at the compensation site(s)
ii. Describe how the Project applied the mitigation hierarchy including efforts to avoid impacts,
and identify residual effects
iii. Describe the process of selecting proposed compensation site(s) and associated baseline
condition(s)
iv. Identify the compensation ratio
v. Identify the success criteria
vi. List the parties and responsibilities for implementation
vii. Provide the monitoring schedule, parameters, plans, and analysis
At a minimum, a compensation ratio of 2:1 is used; however, this ratio varies on a project-by-project
basis. Consultation with the Canadian Wildlife Service is recommended to ensure the appropriate
ratio is identified. In order of priority, the Canadian Wildlife service recommends wetland
restoration over enhancement and enhancement over creation.
In summary, Environment Canada advises proponents that the Wetland Policy applies to all federal
departments and agencies when addressing the loss of wetlands. It will be used to inform the
environmental assessment process and will be considered by Environment Canada when assessing
the appropriate measures to be taken to mitigate the adverse environmental effects of the Project
under CEAA 2012, the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, the Migratory Birds Convention Act,
the International River Improvements Act and the Species at Risk Act.
It is important to note that the identification of ecologically important wetlands and areas where
losses of wetlands have reached critical levels is ongoing. As more data is made available and
analyzed, the advice and associated mapping will be periodically updated to ensure that the
Wetland Policy is implemented in a consistent and transparent manner.

         Environment Canada – Motion to Request Filing Revised Letter of Comment
Environment Canada (EC) is filing this motion to respectfully request permission to revise the Letter of

OF-Fac-Gas-N081-2013-10-02, Hearing Order GH-001-2014 pursuant to Section 58 of the National
Energy Board Act.
                                                                  th
EC has identified an error in Attachment 2 of the original July 10 , 2014 submission. “Attachment 2,
Environment Canada’s Correspondence to the Proponent (dated June 20, 2014 with updates to June

Discovery Contingency Plan” did not contain the June 27, 2014 updates as specified in the title of the
document and as per EC’s intention. The June 27, 2014 updates provide amended information based on
the use of more current data.
EC therefore requests the Board’s consideration of this motion to allow the submission of a revised Letter
of Comment containing the June 27, 2014 updates as intended. The Letter of Comment package has
been corrected and is attached for your consideration. If you have any questions or concerns, please do

RE: Acknowledgement of receipt of a notiﬁcation pursuant to ss. 7911 l of the SQecies at
Risk Act
Dear Ms. Young:
his letter conﬁrms receipt of your letter of notiﬁcation pursuant to 33. 79(1) of the
Species at Risk Act (SARA), on March 17 2014 in the context of the North Montney
Project (the Project).
As a disclaimer, please note that this letter serves only to acknowledge the receipt of your
letter of notiﬁcation pursuant to 35. 79(1) of SARA; it should not be considered as a
response from BC on any other requirement regarding this assessment of environmental
effects process.
EC is the lead jurisdiction under SARA for notiﬁcation purposes for the below species,
and as such can provide information, expertise and advice in relation to them:
0 Yellow Rail
«- Common Nighthawk
o Olive—sided ﬂycatcher
- Canada Warbler
o Rusty Blackbird
The distribution of the above species may overlap with Project components and,
therefore, may have the potential to occur within the Proj ect area. EC further advises that
you must consider, during the environmental assessment process, best available
infonnation regarding the above species such as: ﬁnal or draft federal Recovery
Strategies/Action Plans/Management Plans and Committee on the Status of Endangered
Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) status reports, all of which are available on Species at
Risk Act Public Registry (http://www.sararegjstry.gc.ca).
Canada

The Province of British Columbia is the lead management jurisdiction for the following
SARA-listed species identiﬁed in your notiﬁcation letter. You are advised to consult the
Ministry of Environment of British Columbia for its information, expertise and advice on
the following species:
0 Woodland Caribou (Rangifer T arandus), Northern Mountain Population (Pink
Mountain herd); and,
0 Woodland Caribou (Rangifer Tarandus), Southern Mountain population (Graham
herd).

Barn Swallow, Bank Swallow, and Horned Grebe were not identiﬁed in the SARA
notiﬁcation letter. The distribution of these species may overlap with Proj ect components
and, therefore, may have the potential to occur within the Project area. These species are
not listed under the SARA but have been assessed by COSEWIC. As such, you are
advised that it is best practice to consider COSEWIC assessed species just as if they were
listed under the SARA. EC is the lead jurisdiction for these species. .

Grizzly Bear, Little Brown Myotis, Northern Myotis, Plains Bison, and Crumbled
Tarpaper Lichen were not identiﬁed in the SARA notiﬁcation letter. The distribution of
these species may overlap with Proj ect components and, therefore, may have the potential
to occur within the Project area. These species are not listed under the SARA but have
been designated by COSEWIC. As such, you are advised that it is best practice to
consider COSEWIC designated species just as if they were listed under the SARA. The
Province of British Columbia is the lead jurisdiction for these species and, as such, you
are advised to consult the Ministry of Environment of British Columbia for their
information, expertise and advice on these species.

Please note that under ss. 79(2) of the SARA, the person required under an Act of
Parliament to ensure that an assessment of environmental effects is conducted, and every
authority who makes a determination under paragraph 67 (a) or (b) of CEAA 2012 in
relation to a project, must identify the adverse effects on all listed species, which includes
species of special concern and the critical habitat of extirpated, endangered and
threatened species; and, if the project is carried out, ensure that measures are taken to
avoid or lessen those effects and to monitor them. These measures must A) be consistent
with best available information including any Recovery Strategy, Action Plan or
Management Plan in a ﬁnal or proposed version; and B) respect the terms and conditions
of the Species at Risk Act regarding protection of individuals, residences, and critical
habitat of extirpated, endangered, or threatened species.

The competent minister’s role within environmental assessment is to provide technical
advice and support to the federal authority to assist in addressing these requirements.
However, it should be noted that the SARA competent minister also has certain speciﬁc
obligations relative to species and critical habitat protection stemming from SARA itself,
separate from CEAA 2012 or the environmental assessment process.
