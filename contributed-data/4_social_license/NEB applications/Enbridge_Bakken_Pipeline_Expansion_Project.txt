I am interested/concerned with the proposed brunswick pipeline because it will run within a few hundred meters of
my house and near the schools that my children attend. As well, I have a concern for citizens in other areas of Saint
John. In addition, Emera mentions property taxes that would be payable to the City Of Saint John. Since the city of
Saint John has a serious financial situation, any additional revenue is important.
For areas within Saint John, Emera (or the pipeline operator) needs to set up a system which can automatically close
valves when a drop in gas pressure is detected in the pipeline. As well, the NEB should review the number of valve
stations planned for Saint John to ensure that there is enough and that they are located in the most appropriate
locations to ensure minimum deaths/injuries if a rupture of the pipe occurs.
 The approval process must ensure that the City of Saint John receives direct payments from Emera (either through
property taxes or some other fashion) for the risks and additional costs that its citizens would be taking with a pipeline
running through the city. The City will bear additional costs in preparing to handle an accident, let alone recovery
from one. The approval process must ensure that the City of Saint John is directly and substantially compensated for
this risk/cost.
Adequate saveguards must be in place to reduce the loss of life if the pipeline is ruptured. Even though the likelihood
is low for a rupture, the damage and deaths could be very high with the 'destruction zone' extending out several
hundred meters from the pipeline (according to the documentation provided by Emera).
The Pipleine company must have an automated system set up to close valves in case of a rupture to the pipeline.
They can't depend on human intervention since this would result in excessive delays. According to the documents
filed by Emera, the largest damage area occurs in the first minutes of a leak/rupture, so closing the valves several
minutes to 15 minutes later does not reduce the damage area substantially. The documents submitted by Emera state
that the gas pressure will be monitored for drops in pressure and that they have the capability to remotely shut valves.
So implementing an automatic system which could shut valves within seconds of a drop in gas pressure should be
relatively simple and inexpensive. But it could save many lives in the event of a rupture.
The possibility of someone purposely rupturing the pipeline can not be discounted. As well, the Pipeline will be
routed through areas (such as roads) where digging may occur. So the probabilities quoted in the filings are some
what irrelevant. The important question is the damage and deaths caused by a rupture and what can be done to
reduce this.
Emera must also have safeguards in place to protect the valve stations. These will be locations in which the gas
pipeline is the easiest to vandalize, or destroy (for a terrorist attack). The valve sites must be well secured and
alarmed.

I am writing this letter of comment because I am opposed to the Brunswick pipeline running through our
neighborhood.
I am a resident of the Milford area, and have been for the past 29 years.
The pipeline will be running very near people’s homes. Milford consists of mostly rock, therefore significant blasting
will probably have to take place. This will leave resident’s homes venerable for cracked foundations, cracked
windows, and other damage.
All through Milford there is an abundant of wildlife (deer, raccoons, etc.) and blueberry fields, how will this affect
them, and will they be able to return to normal?
The pipeline will be running right behind our playground and ball-field. On an average day there are plenty of
 children that use these facilities. In the event f a pipeline accident they will be put at risk.
There was once an old dump on Milford Road. From my knowledge there were a lot of things that were buried in this
area. When digging and blasting for the pipeline occur here, what might come to the surface, and will it be safe?
The pipeline will also run right behind our church, very near our senior’s complex, close to our elementary and our
middle school.
In the Milford area we have an active rock quarry, where significant blasting occurs. How will this have an effect on
the pipeline? Has there ever been another 30 inch high pressured export gas pipeline placed within ¼ of a mile from
an active rock quarry? If so, has there ever been any test done to see if the blasting has any effect on the pipeline in
any way?
The pipeline is proposed to run underneath our over-pass, which is our only exit in and out of area. In the event of a
pipeline accident here, we would be unable to have emergency vehicles enter and we would not have access to get
out. On a nice day in the summer, Dominion Park in the Randolph area entertains thousands of people; they would
also be cut off from the rest of the city if there was ever a pipeline accident near the over-pass.
These are some of the reasons I oppose having this pipeline run through our neighborhood. The residents of our area
have the right to safety and security, and unless you could be 100% sure that a pipeline incident would never happen
here, and then it would be taken away.
Sincerely
Sheila Curwin

Letter of comment:
Brunswick Pipeline Project
GH-1-2006
June 23, 2006
I am writing opposing the proposed pipeline to run through Saint John. I am a resident of Milford and I believe that if
there was a leak in this line, that we would not be able to evacuate or have emergency personal access to the area as
 we have only one exit and entrance and the line will be running under that road or bridge area.
 The line is proposed to run very close to homes in the area. I am very surprised that any company would suggest
running such a large line with the 1440 pounds of pressure through residential areas. When you read on the Interstate
Natural Gas Association of Americas, public education page on the internet it states.” Leave the area, warn others, do
not light a match, start an engine, use a telephone in the area, operate a light switch or do anything that may create a
spark. I believe that this proposal is an accident waiting to happen.
I do not see any benefit of this line to us the residents except the danger. The gas will be sent to the USA for there
benefit and the benefit of the company. Residents in this area are very upset and fearful with the thought of this
proposal. This line will also be passing by the Pulp and Paper Mill. What if there was a fire in either the mill or
pipeline what kind of destruction will occur if one interferes with the other and how many lives would be lost? We
also have Bald Hill Quarry where blasting is done. I live approximately one mile from the quarry and on June 19, 2006
at 10:19 my house shook, my stove raddled. This pipeline is to be approximately ¼ mile from the quarry, what kind of
cracking will the movement of land have on the line.
The stress of living in fear of a leak in my neighbourhood is not what I want for my family or neighbours. As I said, we
will have to live with the danger and thought that an accident could happen any time, twenty four hours a day. In my
opinion this will be taking away the quality of life as I enjoy it today.

I am writing this letter in opposition of the pipeline going through the City of Saint John, New Brunswick. I am strongly
opposed of this route because of the safety issues involved. It is my understanding that this supposed 30 inch pipeline
will be up routing our neighbourhoods, roads, our lives as citizens of Saint John. I am a mother of 4 young children
and it is their safety that I am worried about. This supposed pipeline will be running in behind their schools, and I am
not comfortable with this! There are just too many things that can contribute to an accident...and there are too many
LIVES at risk for my liking!!! I would like to know what training was/is issued for the Fire Dept., Police Dept., and local
Hospitals in case of a accident or DISASTER?..because at this time it is my understanding that there is NONE!!!!! There
are just too many unanswered questions at this time to approve this Pipeline! Thank you Terra Dunham, Saint John,
N.B.

As a teacher and a concerned citizen, I feel the proposed route through the city of Saint John NB is inappropriate
because of the danger of the explosion and higher cost to the city to install water and other pipelines in the future. I
would accept an underwater Bay of Fundy route. The majority of the population is against the route through the city.

I am writing this letter because I DO NOT want this supposed 30 inch pipeline going through my city. I do not want
this because of the safety I fear for my Great Grand children. It is my understanding that this pipeline will be running
behind thier schools and home!!!! This is unexceptable in my eyes and I would like to see my Great Grand kids be
able to have a healthy and SAFE environment!!!! Thank you

I am writing this letter in Strong opposition of this supposed 30 inch pipeline going through the city of Saint John! I
live in a very polluted (Air) area of the city and don't feel that this pipeline construction will better my situation or
anyone else's. The blasting that will have to take place is dangerous, and we have already have had an incident in
regards to my power being dirupted, as a direct result of the LNG terminal being built. Accidents do happen!!!!!!!
Thank you

I am interested in the application since I live in Saint John and want to ensure that the pipeline is routed to avoid
populated areas where possible, in order to reduce the risk to the general public.
The NEB should consider an alternative location for the crossing of the St. John River, instead of the proposed Pokiok
to Pleasant Point crossing.
Emera filed information from AK Energy Services (FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT
OF HORIZONTAL DIRECTIONAL DRILLS FOR DUKE ENERGY’S M&N LNG #4 PROJECT Revised August 2, 2005) that
stated that alternatives to the proposed HDD crossing for the St. John River are feasible.
 In particular, I am referencing HDD #8a (Millidgeville to Greenhead Island crossing at entrance Millidgeville Waste
Water Treatment facility) and HDD #9a (Alternate Route Crossing between Grand Bay and South Bay). Both HDD
routes were identified as “Medium Risk”, i.e., feasible.
This alternative routing would avoid residential (and potential residential) areas that the proposed routing would go
through or nearby. The alternate route would avoid the following densely populated areas of Saint John that
proposed route from Emera would affect:
- Old North End of Saint John
- Milford
- Dever Road / Greendale
- Westside Estates / Glenwood Drive subdivisions
- Westgate
- Gault Road
- Fundyview Estates
It would also avoid isolating Milford/Randolf areas (in case of a rupture), which is a concern of some citizens with the
proposed routing.
Regardless of which HDD crossing locations are chosen, the pipeline should be routed to avoid residential areas as
much as possible (as well as areas that are prime for residential development).
In addition, the pipeline should not be routed underneath roads (except to cross them perpendicularly) since roads
are often dug up to repair water pipes, etc. In addition, road ways are generally lined with residential and business
developments, or will be in the future.

Gas Pipelines Deliver Practical Energy Source
For the last several months there has been much debate about the proposed natural gas pipeline that would connect
Canada’s first LNG terminal at Mispec Point with the an existing line in St. Stephen.
Natural gas is a clean burning energy source and it should be encouraged to replace coal and oil fired plants. The
risk factor for this type of pipeline is convincingly low as the armored pipelines are buried underground and are
closely monitored. Even when accidents occur like sloppy road builders hitting a pipe, the gas is lighter than air and
usually dissipates. I am tired of hearing the fear mongering over the route that would cross part of Saint John mostly
 along an existing power line corridor. These areas can be easily restored to their natural condition. The suggestion to
bury the pipeline under the Bay of Fundy is not a viable alternative. With our high tides and strong currents it would
present undue safety and technical challenges during construction, and the potential for future environmental
problems. Costs and labour risks render this alternative impractical and unworkable.
There is always an element of risk when generating electrical power. However, there is nothing new about natural
gas technology. It has safely existed throughout the world and in cities and parks all across North America for many
years. I spent a major part of my career in nuclear power plant construction and believe the more people understand
today’s power technology, the more they are comfortable with it.
The world has electrical generation and consumption problems; therefore all efficient and imaginative opinions
should be welcomed, including natural gas. Solar, tidal and wind power are certainly worthy options, but these
sources cannot presently meet the level of electrical energy required by modern day society. Conservation is also a
very important element in the energy discussion. The natural gas sector presents tremendous employment
opportunities for our region. Let’s be rational in our quest for future energy and enjoy the benefits of having
world-class power projects on our doorstep and not all in the west.

Safety ,would you want a 30 inch LNG line running threw your city! I could not sleep at night knowing what could
happen if there was and accident and people died because all i wanted to do was same a company money. I will not
waste anymoe of your time .Because I really believe the Irvings will get what they want they always do!

Sir. I am writing to you to voice my opposition to the proposed 30" pipeline that Emera Brunswick Pipeline Co.is
hoping to construct across Saint John and through Rockwood Park.Not only is this project a dangergerous one,but
distruction to our streets and neighborhoods.Please keep this in mind when considering Emera's applications.
Yours truly. Richard Barrett. Saint John. N.B.

I am 15 and oppose to your pipeline as it is running near my house and Domminion Park. We swim there all summer.
What happens if there is a leak?

I am 13, and opposed to this pipeline as you are running your pipeline near our ballfield. This is important to us. What
happens if there is an explosion nearby?

no way out if anything was to happen.
Thanks for listening

I am writting to let you know that I am opposed to you running the pipeline through our area(Milford/Randolph) Safety
being the main reason, we have only one way out of Milford and if there was ever an accident with the pipeline we
would have no escape. How does one go to sleep with this hanging over there heads?

I'm writting in regards to the pipeline going through our area. I have grand children whom I enjoy taking to
Domminion Park. If we were at the beach one day and there was a pipeline accident, we would be stranded- no other
way out.

I am opposed to your pipeline as I have family living in Milford area. Also because your pipeline is running near the
hospital. Can you guarantee us there will never be a leak?

All seniors in the Milford area would not be able to get to saftey. The fire dept would be unable to provide any
security, due to the overpass. Any residents in this area would loose there property.

Againts the pipeline. My parents live in Randolph. They would not be able to get help if needed,if there was an
explosion near the overpass.

I am opposed to a 30" gas pipeline running through Saint John. My husband and I both work in the city & our children
attend a day care very near the pipeline route. Knowing that our children may be in danger from an explosion or leak
causes us to re-evaluate our current lifestyle.If this proposal is granted we have no choice but to leave the city. This is
a decision not taken lightly as our families all live here. I have 2 choices: take our children away from their
grandparents & extended families or risk their lives. Please consider my family as well as thousands of other families
when making your decision.

Re: Brunswick Pipeline crossing PID# 00272286 in Musquash, NB.
Brunswick Pipeline Company is planning to construct a pipeline from Saint John, N.B. to the New Brunswick-Maine,
USA border. This proposed pipeline is planned to cross my property PID# 00272286 in Musquash, NB.
 As the land owner of this property I object to this pipeline across my property.
The Brunswick Pipeline has no real economical gain to the region or myself.
This pipeline is solely for the profit of a private company.
The property I own was purchased to allow my family to experience rural living, develop a viable wood lot and
provide an inheritance to my three children. Since purchasing the property 16 years ago the New Brunswick
Department of Transportation has taken a portion of the property, plus in the process, abandoning approximately 2
acres of land between two highways with no retribution. New Brunswick Power took another portion for an expanded
power line. The New Brunswick Government through the influence of outside interest created an environmentally
protected area around the edge of my property making the property harder to access, Maritime North East Pipeline
took a portion of the property to construct the first pipeline to Saint John, New Brunswick. Irving Forest Services has
contracted the cutting of over 5000 acres of crown forest land next to my property.
    With the construction of first pipeline across my property (by Maritime Northeast Pipeline) my property has been
more accessible to off road vehicles, the company indicated that gates and fences would be constructed and
maintained. The gates were erected at the end of the construction phase but there is no evidence of maintenance
being performed on the gates or easement since the construction ended. This second pipeline will make my property
even more accessible to off road vehicles and allow better access for the theft of wood off of my property.
    In the 16 years of owning the property there has been a continuously stream of heavy equipment and construction
traffic on the access road in front of my house damaging the access road and disrupting my rural setting, which was
one of the main reasons I moved from the city.
    Since the announcement of the Brunswick Pipeline, my wife and I have had only one visit from Maritime and
Northeast Pipeline Ltd’s company representative. At that meeting the company indicated that it was reviewing
proposed routes for the pipeline and asked for permission for access and field studies, this permission has been given
for a period of 24 months ending August 08, 2007. These surveys were to conduct archaeological, environmental and
borehole investigations, survey measurements and staking( field studies). The agreement signed by Maritime and
Northeast Pipeline Ltd and myself indicated that after the surveys had been completed, the company shall notify the
Owner if the easement route is proposed to be located on the owner’s land. Since the signing of the permission on
August 08, 2005 there has been no communication from the pipeline company. If the surveys have been completed
then I no longer grant permission to the Brunswick Pipeline Company or any companies working for the Brunswick
Pipeline Company access to my property.
    The Brunswick Pipeline Company indicates that the pipeline is safe, there is thousands of hectors of crown land to
the north of my property where this pipeline could be constructed, thereby not affecting the property of private
landowners like myself.
    In conclusion I do not support the Brunswick Pipeline access across my property, and if the pipeline is to be
constructed then the pipeline should cross crown land thereby not affecting rural landowners.

I am opposed to the pipeline running through the city of Saint John. How will the residents be evacuated in the event
of an accident? What about the people who live in the Milford area? I have friends that live in that area how in gods
name will they get help or get out if a leak was to happen,where there is only one way in? The pipeline should be
away from all residental areas. I'm sure that the company could find another route that wouldn't put people at risk!

I am opposed to you running your pipeline through the Milford area, as my daughter lives there. Their only way out is
the "Lou Murphy Overpass". What if there is a gas leak?

My family lives in Red Head and the pipeline will go very close to our subdivision. There are many children in the
area. I fear for there safety knowing the possibility of an explosion due to leaks or ruptures in the pipeline. Also
worried about any spin offs from the LNG plant.

I do not want this pipeline going through our city because of the danger that could happen to the citizens of Saint
John. I think they should put it under the bay. I think they should listen to the citizens and approve the under water
route.

There should never be allowed to put a 30 inch pipeline through the city near hospitals, schools, churches,atc. I think
we are the only city in Canada that is being forced to put up with this especially the danger& enviroment& no benefit
to us only the United States. We were riped off with the LNG project and if they must have this discusting dangereous
deal. Then put it in the bay of Fundy, they have enough money from the tax rip off 5oo Million dollars for 25 years.
Which I feel is amble to put it in the bay where its safer.
Thank You

We are residents of Milford Road. The proposed pipeline is to run aproxamitally 200 to 300 feet behind our home on
Irving’s property. We were not aware of this pipeline until a neighbors came to our door informing us of this. Our
homes foundation is poured onto the bedrock. What is blasting going to do to our house? How will we be able to
sleep, with the thought that an accident could happen anytime? How will we deal with the stress of living so close to
this? When the company picked the route did they not consider the mental stress they will be putting on us the
residents? How will we be able to get out of the area, if we live through a leak that caches fire? What about all the
seniors who live here, the impact on there mental health, if we are feeling like this, and we are not seniors. The
company should be ashamed of themselves for even considering a pipeline through residential areas especially in the
Milford area, where there is one way in or out. Emergency personal would not be able to get in, if there is a leak near
 the overpass.
Why should we the residents live in fear?

I am opposed to your pipeline running through Milford area as I have family living there. If any leaks occure, their
only way out is the LOU Murphy overpass.

I'm writing this letter to let you know that I'm opposed to your pipeline as my mother& family live in the Milford area. I
fear for their lives if ever there was a leak.

I am writing to let you know, I am opposed to the proposal of a 30 inch natural gas pipeline running through Milford
and the City. I am a resident of Milford Road and we have only 1 entrance into the area. That is our overpass. The
over pass was built in 1984 after 2 children died as the ambulance could not exit the area as a train was blocking the
road, at that time there was no overpass. I believe that if there was leaks anywhere near the overpass, we again
would be in the same situation that claimed the lives of the 2 Gifford children. We as residents pressured the
provincial government to have a safe access out of the area that would never be blocked again. Now it seem, here we
go again.
If this pipeline gets approval I certainly would hope that there will be another road put into the area to always allow
access out away from the pipeline as we are all aware that accidents do happen, as we are all aware in this area of
 innocent lives being lost that no one would of ever thought could happen, but it shore did and could happen!
 I am hoping that you the National Energy Board take this into consideration when making a decision that would affect
the residents who live beyond the overpass.
Sincerely,
Kenneth Jennings

I am opposed to the proposal for a 30 inch natural gas pipeline coming through our city and the neighborhoods. I am
a resident of Milford and I am very concerned that the pipeline will be running behind my home. There is only one
way out and that is the Louis Murphy overpass. I am also concerned that anyone who lives past Kingsville Road would
also be blocked in if there was a leak at that area. This pipeline will be here for many years and anything could
happen in the life of the pipeline. As a life long resident, I can’t believe that such a proposal of running a large
pipeline in residential areas is a benefit to any resident. The thought of not being able to get out at Kingsville Road
and the overpass is frightening, not to mention that emergency personal could not help us. As a senior the anxiety of
what is being proposed, not to mention if it goes through, how we will always have the fear of what if or when an
accident could happen.
 To me this is unacceptable danger in our neighborhood and should be rerouted.
Yours Truly,
Kathleen B Jennings

My interest in the application of Emera putting a pipeline through the city is two-fold. I live within 2 miles of the
proposed route. If anything should happen and there is an explosion I am aware that the heat from that would be felt
as far away as two miles due to an incident that happened in Clark County Kentucky. I am concerned for the safety of
my children as well as myself and there is also an elementary school closer than my house to the proposed pipeline
route. The second concern I have is the interruption in use of Rockwood Park. It is a haven from the hustle and bustle
of everyday life in the city. I am also concerned about the wildlife and eco-system that this pipeline will disrupt.

I wish to express my opposition to the 30" export gas line proposed to run through Saint John. I am a resident of the
city and have been for many years. I am a senior citizen who wishes to leave to my children and grandchildren a city
they can be proud of and more importantly be safe in. We the citizens of this community do not want nor need this
intrusion in our city. Over sixteen thousand of us have signed a petition stating just that. I can not understand why our
concerns and voices are being ignored for the benefit of a few. I live in Saint John N.B. NOT Irvingville..
        Thank you
        Leonard Williams Citizen.

I wish to comment on the route that the pipeline will follow through Milford and the West side of Saint John. I have
lived in Saint John for 25 years, and I have witnessed the creation of the Church Street overpass to allow for fast
emergency response to the Milford peninsula. The 800 metre no pass zone which comes into effect in the event of a
pipeline accident will effectively cut off ANY access to the peninsula. I have too many friends living in that area to
stand by and do nothing. I am glad for this opportunity to voice my opinion and objection.
Furthermore, I have recently come to realise that any accident in the Ocean Westway area of the pipeline route will
effectively shut down ANY access to both of the highways leading out of the city from the West Side. Highways 1 and 7
converge in this area and both would be inaccessible in the enforced 800 metre exclusion zone.
These are serious flaws and need to be reexamined to avoid unnecessary risk to the citizens of Saint John.

I want to express my opposition to the 30" pipeline proposed to run through Saint John. There is no reason to
jeopardize the lives of the citizens of this city when the pipeline could easily be placed under the bay. Even if the
odds of an accident or explosion are minute, any chance taken with people's lives is unacceptable.

To National Energy Board.
 As a life long resident of the Milford area, I am writing to express my opposition to the Brunswick Pipeline Project.
We have one exit from this area and an accident could cause this exit to be distroyed. Our health and saftey is a
prime concern. We would not be able to access the hospital and would be cut off from help and assistance. There are
alternate paths for the pipeline as well as shipping the product. Please explore other options.

National Energy Board,                                   Sept.6, 2006
    My name is Ken Palmer, and I reside at 57 Milford Road. My ancestors first settled in the area around 1900, as has
many of my neighbors. Many of these long term residents and their ancestors have lived here for anywhere from 2-5
generations.
    The Milford/Randolph area is made up of many hard working families. There is roughly 6,000 adults over the age of
18 living in this area, plus an estimated guess of 750-1000 kids, under the age of 18. Then if you add the number of
 people who working in the area, plus kids attending daycare, community centers, ballfields, Dominion Park Beach
and daily church services. You have a significant amount of people living or visiting this area, at any given time.
    The area is serviced by only one entrance/exit, and that is the Lou Murphy Overpass, constructed in 1984. Now you
can understand the objections and frustrations of the area’s residents regarding the proposed route of the pipeline,
under or near this overpass.
    Before this overpass was built in 1984, there was a train crossing located at this spot. Lives were lost in a fire and
people have been passed through box cars to waiting ambulances, since the tracks were blocked by trains- thus this is
a very sensitive area for the residents.
    On July 18, 2006 Brunswick Pipeline invited area residents to an information meeting specifically to address the
concerns of the Milford/Randolph residents. At this meeting I asked Mr. Ralph Myers about an alternate route in the
case of an evacuation or an accident occurred at the Lou Murphy Overpass. Mr. Myers assured everyone in
attendance, that they had secured a signed contract for access for emergency response vehicles and personnel across
J.D. Irving’s property. This contract was signed on July 17, 2006, yet he didn’t produce this document for verification by
area residents, as he should have. This letter says nothing about the area’s residents crossing J.D. Irving’s property-
received copy of contract, approximately 10 days after the meeting.
    In case of an accident at the Lou Murphy Overpass, this alternate route across J.D. Irving’s property is less than 200
meters from the proposed route of the pipeline and there internal roadway is located directly under the Lou Murphy
Overpass.
The National Energy Board must do the job of protecting the safety and security of area residents, then merely relying
on public relations statements and rhetoric from Brunswick Pipeline and J.D. Irving officials. These companies have a
vested interest in the construction of this pipeline.
Examples where I believe Brunswick Pipeline and J.D. Irving’s officials are neglecting the safety of the residents.
    1) Question Darlene Richard C59-DR 1.15
    2) Question Darlene Richard C59-DR 1.18
    3) Question Darlene Richard C59-DR 1.26
Regarding Question (1) J.D. Irving can not provide access to its lands in the case of an emergency response, since the
emergency Measures Zone (EMZ) according to the Brunswick Pipeline is 800 meters radius from any pipeline incident-
Quote by Emera Brunswick to question (3) Darlene Richard. Now regarding Question (3) Emera Brunswick states the
pipeline to be an adequate distance away from the overpass structure. The further the pipeline is located from the
overpass, the closer the pipeline is to J.D. Irving’s entrance to his property and the internal roadway, now less than
200 meters, well within the EMZ.
Now in the case of myself and the other 85 homeowners who live north of the Kingsville Road, if there was an
accident we have no means of getting out.
Question by Darlene Richard C 59-DR 1.11. Their answer to Dawn Baldwin’s question C29-DB 1.11 is ridiculous; it
shows they have no knowledge of the area in question. I would welcome the opportunity to meet with anyone from
the NEB at anytime to take them on a tour of the area in question and show you our neighborhood with its’ unique
challenges.
No pipeline route should be given approval without having an alternate route, evacuation plan and emergency
planning in place first.
Comments about questions and answers, regarding questions posed by Darlene Richard. Question: C 59-DR 1.12.
Damage to property and property values – windows and doors can be replaced, but cracked foundations will lower
the value of any home. Homeowners should receive compensation immediately for cracked foundations, not just to
have them repaired. Crack foundations will affect the resale value of any home.
Question: C59-DR 1.7 Railway lines and storage area in Milford/Randolph area:
The question should have been, if there was a pipeline incident in this area by the Lou Murphy Overpass, could the
 numerous rail cars and tractor trailers rupture or explode, because they are located within 3 or 400 meters of the
overpass. These railway cars and tractor trailers are transporting and storing munition for the army, as well as
dangerous and hazard materials. There are 10 sets of train tracks at this location – all at this location you have the
pipeline, Lou Murphy Overpass, railway cars, tractor trailers loaded with munition and dangerous and hazardous
materials and the internal roadway that Brunswick Pipeline and J.D. Irving officials say the residents can use in the
case of an emergency, all located within 3 or 400 meters – Sounds like an accident waiting to happen.
    Question: C59-DR 1.16. When trucks are using the Lou Murphy Overpass during construction of the pipeline, will an
alternate route be open to all area residents at all times? Since the trucks will be tying up the overpass at various
times by bringing in equipment as well as the many pieces of pipe that will be 20 meter in length. Also in case any
emergency vehicles need to get through – fire trucks and ambulances.
    Question C59-DR 1.24. Shut-off valves: Since the estimated time for a technician to arrive manually to shut down a
line block valve is 30 to 45 minutes, is it possible for a technician to be permanently stationed in this area due to the
external risk, overpass, storage areas etc.
    Decisions of this magnitude should not and cannot be made by representatives of the NEB in Calgary, regarding
the proposed route. You should view it in person and determine if this is the right location for the pipeline.
    I sincerely hope that Brunswick Pipeline and the NEB will look for an alternate route. As I stated earlier I would be
more than happy to meet anyone from the NEB to discuss this issue, at any time.

I am a resident of Milford. I am opposed to the Brunswick Pipeline running through the city. As a resident and
homeowner of Milford, I have grave concerns of the impact of blasting near my home. My home is aproxamitally 150
meters from where the pipeline is proposed to run through the old incinerator property (dump). My home is set on the
rocks and the blasting may affect my foundation and crack my walls.
I also live beyond the Kingsville Road and if there was a leak that ignited at that area or beyond. I believe the
emergency personal would have no access to assist anyone beyond that point.
 My next concern is the Louis Murphy Overpass which is our only entrance/exit to the area. If there was a leak it would
be impossible to exit or enter the area for myself, other residents, but most important the emergency personal.
In closing, I hope the NEB will take into consideration the concerns of the residents of the Milford/Randolph area and
the City.
                                   Sincerely,

        I oppose the gas pipeline going through the city of Saint John. I am a senior citizen and living in Mildford. If this
pipeline is allowed to run through Saint John I and every other resident of Milford is going to be stranded if any sort of
problem arises along the pipeline route. If an exposion occurs we will not survive. The citizens of this great city
deserve more than to be treated like disposable garbage so that the Irvings can make even more money.
 Please take into account the amount of opposition to this proposal. I hope, as members of the NEB, you support the
citizens of this city and deny this pipeline proposal
 Thank You

    I want to add my voice to the many citizens of Saint JOhn who oppose the building of a 30" gas export pipeline
through the city. This is truly beyong belief that a corporation would even consider putting the citizens of Saint John
in harm's way in order to make another buck.            I live in Milford. We (along with the residents of Champlain Height
in East Saint John) will be placed in the greatest danger if this allowed.
     In Milford we will be cut off from the rest of the city should an explosion occur under the Lou Murphy bridge and
in Champlain Heights, if an explosion occurs inside or near the Irving refinery, the residents will definitely not survive.
   We, as citizens, are fighting this battle to save our lives and trust that the people at the NEB will see this and make
 a decison for the people and against big business.

        I live in East Saint JOhn and strongly oppose this pipeline going through the city. I have lived here for over fifty
years and have never heard of such a proposal before. My children and grand children deserve to live in a city that
they can feel safe in. It is bad enough that we have to live with pollution from the Irving pulp mills,Irving refinery,
Irving tissue and every other business. Why should our lives be in dangered further with this pipeline and the very real
possibility of an explosion.

I have two interests in this application. My first is as a 41-year citizen of Saint John who was, like many others,
outraged when a private company proposed to put a large, high-pressure natural gas pipeline through our biggest city
park because it is easy and convenient for the company and would allow it to make higher profits, when there is a
 better alternative – albeit difficult, expensive and inconvenient – the marine route, which is essentially risk- and
inconvenience-free for residents of Saint John. My second interest is as a homeowner whose house is about 75
metres from the electrical transmission lines in Emera's “preferred corridor” for the pipeline (west of Rockwood Park).
Though I have a variety of interests and am a member of a variety of organizations, I write this letter of comment in
my own right; I have no direct connection to any other submissions which may be made to you.
I attended two N.E.B. presentations in Saint John and a public information session put on by Emera and Duke Energy
(at the Millidgeville Community Centre in mid-August, 2006); I also attended some public meetings sponsored by the
“Friends of Rockwood Park”. I have read all the documentation available at these presentations, and all the Emera
application, including the appendices and the part of the May 2006 Jacques Whitford Environmental and
Socio-economic assessment: Brunswick Pipeline Project relevant to my interests.
My comments mainly concern:
     1) the public interest;
     2) a marine route for the proposed pipeline which avoids several of the problems associated with the marine route
chosen, for its own reasons, by the applicant;
     3) NAFTA;
     4) risk; and
     5) the use of deceptive language in the application.
1) the public interest
The public interest, as defined in your 2003 booklet Pipeline Regulation in Canada; a Guide for Landowners and the
Public (p. 31), cannot be invoked to save private companies from the consequences of unwise and imprudent business
decisions. In a capitalist system, risks taken justify profits made. Profits are not supposed to be guaranteed and
sometimes this voluntary assumption of risk in the search for profit results in losses, rather than profit. That is how the
system is supposed to work.
It is clear from the application (including the appendices), the Environmental and Socio-economic assessment:
Brunswick Pipeline Project, and from what Emera and Duke Energy representatives said at the public information
meeting I attended at the Millidgeville Community Centre in mid-August, 2006, that Emera signed a contract with some
part of Repsol (and, possibly, Irving Oil) to have Duke Energy build for it a large diameter pipeline to carry
high-pressure re-gasified LNG from the Canaport LNG terminal in Saint John to the U.S. border, where it will link up
with an existing pipeline, and that both Emera and Duke Energy assumed that this pipeline could be built fairly
cheaply overland, through the middle of Saint John. When strong objections were made to this overland route – and
in particular to its traversing of Rockwood Park – and strong preferences were voiced for a marine route, Emera and
Duke Energy looked at the cost of two marine routes, the difficulties which would be encountered because of sea
conditions, and the schedule that they had contracted to meet, and announced that the marine route “is not viable”.
As it is put in section 1.8.6. of the application (page 8) (and repeated on page 35 under “Findings”): “The marine
crossing of Saint John Harbour was considered thoroughly but rejected as it would not be practical due to higher
safety, technical, cost, schedule and environmental risks as compared to the preferred corridor”.
However, the Project Consulting Services Inc. Feasibility Study of a Proposed Crossing of the Outer Saint John
Harbour, Saint John, New Brunswick (appendix 3) (hereafter “PCS study”), and answers given by the Duke Energy
Project Manager to direct questions at that public information meeting in Millidgeville Community Centre in
mid-August, both stated clearly that a pipeline could be built safely following the proposed marine route (or
“corridor”); it would just be inconvenient for Emera and Duke Energy. (The two companies might lose money and
might not meet the schedule they have contracted to meet.) So from the Public Interest point of view, the marine
route* – which avoids risk to Saint John citizens – is viable, even if it causes serious problems for the companies who
have contracted to build a pipeline.
* NOTE. I should like to clarify what I mean by “marine route”. The “marine route” selected by Emera and Duke
Energy's “Team” is unsuitable. It is unclear whether or not the “Team” knew this when they selected that route (its
unsuitability should have been obvious as soon as it looked at the marine chart). The Duke Energy Project Manager
could not give reasons for this choice of the first part of the marine route when asked a direct question at a public
meeting, except that it was the shortest distance between two points – Mispec Point and Sheldon Point. This short,
straight-line route might seem defensible to those concerned primarily about pipeline length and cost per metre, but it
introduces unnecessary complications (such as crossing fishing grounds and anchorage areas) that a more sensible
 choice of route would have avoided. Hereafter this obviously unsuitable marine route will be designated “the Emera
marine route”. The Conservation Council of New Brunswick, after consultation with local fishers and others, has
proposed a suitable marine route which avoids several of the problems associated with “the Emera marine route”.
Hereafter this suitable marine route will be designated “the CCNB marine route”.
2) the marine route
Anybody interested in pipelines understands that a sub-sea route for such a large diameter pipe would cost more than
an overland route which goes mainly across “undeveloped” land. Anybody who has experience of sea conditions off
Saint John (I have kayaked there year round for years) understands that laying such a pipeline there will be
expensive, difficult and subject to undetermined weather-caused delays.
The “key difficulties the Team identified with a corridor that includes a marine crossing of the harbour” are listed on
pages 35-36 of the Emera application. They are (1) the “occupational safety risks for divers and other marine
construction workers”. The existence of these risks is undeniable but local divers who have worked in these waters
can tell you that the use of appropriate safety precautions can greatly mitigate (though not eliminate) these risks.
These are, in any case, risks voluntarily assumed by the workers involved who are well paid for assuming them; the
risks imposed on residents of Saint John by the overland route would be involuntarily assumed in order for private
companies to generate higher profits, with no benefit to the residents who are left with the risks. (2) “The bottom-lay
portion of the marine crossing and the HDD installations at the entry and exit to the water would be technically
challenging”. So it would be hard. Oh, dear! In any case, the bottom-lay portion of the marine crossing route
proposed by CCNB and the HDD installations at the entry and exit to the water on that route would probably be less
challenging than those of the Emera marine crossing route (see below). (3) “The marine corridors would intersect
marine fish habitat and shoreline habitat”. The CCNB marine route, developed in consultation with local fishers,
avoids both marine fish habitat and environmentally sensitive areas. (4) extra cost. This is undeniable, though the
extent of the extra cost associated with the CCNB marine route might be questioned. As we have no access to the
contracts signed by Emera and Duke Energy with Repsol the consequences of the extra costs are unknown. Maybe
Emera and/or Duke Energy would lose money on this contract instead of making money. As noted above, that is
called risk in the capitalist system; it has no relevance to the Canadian public interest. (5) scheduling requirements.
While the “Project Schedule” (page 22 of the application) states: “Construction and testing starts in the 4th quarter of
2007 and ends one year later, at the end of the 3rd quarter of 2008” – not enough time to build along the CCNB
marine route – we find in paragraph 3 under “Economic feasibility” (page 29) the FSA contract “commencing on a
date within the period November 1, 2008 to November 1, 2009”. So there seems to be a year's leeway. Given that the
PCS study seems to take a worst case scenario throughout, it may well be possible for Emera and Duke Energy to
construct the pipeline along the CCNB marine route within the schedule they have contracted for. If not, Repsol will
have to wait a few months before it can start to make money – an eventuality not unknown in the hydrocarbon
business.
Some further comments on specific aspects of the PCS study, AK Energy Services' August 2, 2005, Feasibility
Assessment of Horizontal Directional Drills for Duke Energy's M & N LNG # 4 Project (appendix 4; hereafter “AK
report”) and the CCNB marine route are warranted here.
(a) sea conditions.
PCS consulted with many people for its study, including those involved with the maintenance and repair of the oil
pipeline between Mispec Point and the Canaport oil buoy. PCS appears to have assumed that sea conditions for the
Emera marine route would be similar to those between Mispec Point and the Canaport oil buoy, and to have based its
assumptions about delays – and hence about costs and scheduling problems – on this assumption. But PCS did not
consult local fishers (see page 7 of the PCS study). Otherwise it might have understood that sea conditions along a
marine route which starts on the north side of Black Point (to avoid the Black Point dumping ground) and passes near
Partridge Island before turning to pass along Lorneville Head from Negro Point to Tiner Point (the CCNB marine
route), are not as severe as those between Mispec Point and the Canaport oil buoy. While I am in no position to
question PCS's technical expertise, I do question its assumption about sea conditions (and I write as a year-round
kayaker in those waters).
(b) Bringing the pipeline ashore.
As noted above, the best place for the eastern end of the pipeline to come ashore is on the north side of Black Point
(as proposed by CCNB). The best option for the western end of any marine route is to bring the pipeline ashore near
Tiner Point. Trying to bring it through the Sheldon Point rockface is self-evidently silly; a cynic might suggest that
proposing something so silly and so unnecessary was intended primarily to bring the marine route into disrepute. It is
 unnecessary because where the rock cliff ends just west of Sheldon Point, and well away from environmentally
sensitive areas, the sand of Saint's Rest Beach is backed by a clay mound behind which is an old quarry owned by a
sister company to Irving Oil, with plenty of space to locate equipment. A pipeline brought ashore here could pass
under Sand Cove Road, through an undeveloped area (owned, I believe, either by the Province of New Brunswick or
the City of Saint John), east of the sewage treatment plant and along Highway 1 either to Prince Of Wales or,
preferably, alongside the existing oil pipeline to Coleson Cove. This would provide the “open cut beach approach”
that the AK report calls for on pages 10 and 38.
     But this would still be a less desirable alternative to bringing the pipeline ashore near Tiner Point. It is not clear
from the AK report why, when it suggests an “open cut beach approach”, it does not propose a readily available one
at Maguires Cove, just west of Tiner Point. There is rumour of an intention to locate a barge wharf for gypsum at this
cove at some future date and some kind of site work has taken place there recently (I have visited the cove both by
land and by kayak within the past month), but if the gas pipeline is as safe as we are told it is, there should be no
problem of co-existence. Or the barge wharf site could be moved closer to the generating plant, or to its west. At
least we would be dealing with two industrial land uses, with no risk to the general public. Again, a cynic might
suggest that this “easy” pipeline exit point was omitted because it is “easy” and hence relatively inexpensive.
     A cynic might also wonder whether the two proposals in the AK report to run HDD#5a and HDD#6a (AK report,
pages 13, 20) through environmentally very sensitive areas were made in order to bring any marine route into
disrepute.
3) NAFTA
Although, like most Canadians, I have not read the NAFTA agreement, I have read much about it. If I have understood
correctly, Canada cannot under NAFTA reduce its hydrocarbon-based energy exports to the U.S. A. unless it reduces
its own consumption proportionately.
     The re-gasified LNG which would flow through a pipeline built from the Canaport LNG terminal to the U.S. border
would be considered Canadian product, even though the LNG is imported into Canada. James T. Jensen's Potential
Supplies available to Maritimes LNG Receipt Terminals (appendix 6) indicates that there is a broad range of potential
supplies for the LNG to be processed at the Canaport terminal for export through a pipeline.. Section 7.3.2.1.1 of the
Emera application (p. 56) gives an impressive list of current actual and potential sources under contract to Repsol or
its affiliates. However, current Canadian foreign policy and Canadian trade policy and practice, the widely shared
view around the world that the U.S.A. has become a rogue state, and the widely shared recognition that Canada and
the U.S.A. have integrated hydrocarbon-based and electrical energy systems, all together increase dramatically the
future possibility of some kind of international embargo or boycott of LNG sales to Canada. If this were to happen and
no LNG came to the Canaport terminal, obviously no re-gasified natural gas could be exported through a pipeline to
the U.S.A. Under NAFTA, most of this this reduction in exports of natural gas from Canada to the U.S.A. would have to
be made up from other Canadian sources of natural gas, and this at a time when Canada would be unlikely to have
spare capacity. This possibility should be considered and weighed in the balance when the decision is made as to
whether it is in the Canadian public interest that this or any pipeline be built to export re-gasified LNG from the
Canaport terminal to the U.S.A.
4) risk
Routing the proposed pipeline through the City of Saint John creates a risk for all the citizens of Saint John and a
greater risk for those who live in proximity to the proposed pipeline route (which includes my wife and me). This risk
is avoided if the proposed pipeline follows the CCNB marine route. Avoiding avoidable risk to Canadian citizens
should be a major factor to be considered when weighing what is in the public interest.
     The extent of the risk is not clear from the application. The February 14, 2006 Quantitative Risk Analysis of the
Proposed Brunswick Natural Gas Pipeline: Final Report by Bercha International Inc (appendix 5) (hereafter “the
Bercha analysis”) is one of the weakest parts of the application.
     (a) The descriptions and photographs provided in section 2.3 (Site characteristics) fail to mention or to show the
heavily populated areas – including Candlewood Lane where my wife and I live – near the proposed “preferred
corridor” between the western end of Rockwood Park and Pokiok. Intentionally or deliberately, a false impression is
thus created of the kind of terrain bordering on the “preferred corridor”.
     (b) I was unable to find any consideration of the possibility of sabotage in this risk analysis. Political and
geo-political developments over the past five years have significantly increased the likelihood of terrorist attacks on
targets such as LNG terminals and natural gas pipelines in North American residential areas. The number of large
energy-related plants in this area – a huge, very modern refinery; one oil-fired and one nuclear-powered electricity
generating plant – already make it attractive to potential terrorists or saboteurs because it offers them a variety of
targets. These factors needs to be quantified and added in to the risk analysis. It is also a fact, given no recognition
 in the Bercha analysis, that many people in the Saint John area believe they have reason to believe that Irving
interests have ruined their livelihoods, their lives and/or their environment. As the Emera pipeline is generally
considered to be part of the “Irving empire”, this creates another risk factor which needs to be quantified and added
in to the risk analysis. Events in other parts of the world – and indeed locally, such as recently on Grand Manan Island
– show that when people are reduced to desperate straits, they are liable to carry out desperate acts which would
otherwise be out of character. For example, it would be simple to clear the fill off a small section of the pipeline and
shoot tracer bullets into it from a safe distance; perhaps our house and our neighbours' would be incinerated in the
subsequent blow-out. None of this appears in the Bercha risk analysis.
    (c) The “Comparative Individual Risk of Fatality” chart on page 7.5 of the Bercha analysis is not applicable to the
proposal to build a pipeline across part of southern New Brunswick. We do not get tornadoes or hurricanes or floods
in the area through which it is proposed to build the pipeline. Moreover, no specific account is taken of the fact that
the proposed pipeline passes near the largest oil refinery in Canada, located in the eastern portion of the City of Saint
John, and not far from the nuclear generating plant at Point Lepreau. So the comparative figures quoted are
generalities apparently based on experience in other localities (probably in the U.S.A.), and are not valid for this area.
It should also be noted that, with the partial exception of “fires”, all the risks that are listed as being higher than that
of residents living near the proposed pipeline are due to individual human agency – people taking risks voluntarily.
We accept, for example, that we take a substantial risk if we choose to drive a car (or go out in a kayak). This type of
risk is so qualitatively different from that which would be created by the proposed pipeline – a risk imposed on us
against our will, and an avoidable risk that the CCNB marine route would eliminate – that the “Comparative Individual
Risk of Fatality” chart is worth no more than a listing that compares apples and oranges.
    (d) I could find no mention of an assessment of the risks to Saint John residents if the CCNB marine route – or the
Emera marine route – were followed, rather than the “preferred corridor”. Perhaps this is because such an analysis
would show that the risks to residents if any marine route were followed are so small as to be non-quantifiable. As a
kayaker who regularly uses the waters near and over the proposed marine routes I would be more exposed to risk
than most, but I am prepared to accept that risk as it would be voluntarily assumed – I could always kayak somewhere
else. But if the “preferred corridor” brings the pipeline near my house I have no choice about putting up with the risk
imposed on me for someone else's benefit.
    (e) There is something profoundly offensive in the notion that a risk deliberately imposed on people like my wife
and me is said, without any consultation with those concerned, to be “acceptable” to those who plan to make money
out of imposing the risk. We are the ones to decide whether the risk is acceptable to us and we have decided it is not,
whatever Bercha International Inc's opinion may be.
5) the use of deceptive language in the application
There are a number of places in the Emera application that blur the line between the Emera pipeline project and the
larger project involving the Canaport LNG terminal. This is particularly true when the case for the Emera pipeline
project being in the public interest is being made. A variety of terms might be used to describe this kind of thing,
'disingenuous' and 'deceptive' being among the politer ones.
    It begins with the very first sentence in the application, in section 1.1.1.: “The principal purpose of the Brunswick
Pipeline is to connect the Canaport Liquified Natural Gas terminal to markets in Maritimes Canada and the
Northeastern United States...”. The rest of the application (e.g., the Design Flow Chart, figure 7.1 on page 61, which
shows that all the gas will go to the U.S.) and the Duke Energy Project Manager's respnse to a direct question at the
public meeting at the Millidgeville Community Centre in mid-August, 2006, make it clear that none of the gas to flow
through the Brunswick Pipeline is intended for “Maritimes [sic] Canada” and the proposed pipeline will not “connect
the Canaport Liquified Natural Gas terminal to markets in Maritimes Canada”. So it is false to state that the “principal
purpose” of the pipeline is to do something the pipeline builders have no intention of doing. It is also deceptive to put
“Maritimes Canada” before “the North-eastern United States”, as if “Maritimes Canada” were the more important
market, when in fact it is not an intended market for this pipeline at all.
    Section 1.10.3 of the Emera application (page 10) states: “The Project will provide significant benefits to Maritimes
Canada by making available a new and diverse source of natural gas supply...” This, too, is false. On page 30, we
find that this statement applies to the larger Canaport LNG terminal project, which has already passed N.E.B. scrutiny
and is irrelevant to the Emera pipeline application. Section 1.10.3 continues: “The Brunswick Pipeline will also
promote growth of markets in Maritimes Canada, by providing additional natural gas infrastructure in the region”.
This is also false, as the existence of a dedicated pipeline carrying gas to the U.S.A. cannot promote “growth of
markets in Maritimes Canada”.
    Section 1.14.1. (page 12) again states: “The markets to be served by the Brunswick Pipeline are located in
Maritimes Canada and the North-eastern United States”, which is again false.
    Section 1.14.2. (page 13) states: “Repsol Canada, in conjunction with Irving Oil, will make available re-gasified
 LNG in Maritimes Canada to serve the existing market and to help facilitate the further development of the natural gas
market and infrastructure in the Maritimes Canada region.” This is no doubt true, but it has nothing to do with the
Emera Pipeline Project to export natural gas to the U.S.A..
    Section 1.14.3. (page 13) states: “The Brunswick Pipeline will provide welcome diversification to the Maritimes
Canada natural gas marketplace by providing access to a new source of supply”. It takes a form of mental gymnastics
unknown to me to square that sentence with the fact that the Brunswick Pipeline is intended to only take gas to the
United States.
    Section 1.14.4. (page 13) states: “Existing and future Maritimes Canada markets can be served off the Brunswick
Pipeline by using backhauls on the M & NP system or by transacting gas swaps between existing production from
SOEP and the LNG deliveries”. This may be true (though page 30 implies something different) but the Brunswick
Pipeline is not designed with this in mind and its builders have no intention of using it in this way.
    Section 7.4.1.1.1. (page 63-4) “Markets Description and Analysis – Canada” is not relevant to the Emera pipeline
project; the Canadian market will be sourced from the larger Canaport LNG terminal project. So it is deceptive to
mention it here.
    Section 7.4.1.1.3. (page 64-6) “Macro Market Information – CEA study” (and the full CEA study in appendix 7) is also
deceptive in that it again tries to imply that Atlantic Canada will be served by the Brunswick Pipeline Project, rather
than by the Canaport LNG terminal project.
    The bottom line on page 30 states: “For all of the foregoing reasons, development of the Brunswick Pipeline is in
the public interest”; but most of the items in the fairly short list preceding this statement involve the Canaport LNG
terminal, not the Brunswick Pipeline Project.
That the applicant has to use deception and false statements to support its claim that its application is in the public
interest should give the Board pause.
In fact, the only real benefit for the Canadian public interest that I could find in the whole of the Emera application are
employment during construction and: “The Project will generate ongoing expenditures in the order of $3.4 million
annually...The Project will also contribute tax revenues to various levels of government...a total of $7.3 million”.
These figures seem inflated but even if they are fairly accurate, this has to be balanced against the risk and
inconvenience to residents and the development which will not take place (the opportunity costs) because of the
pipeline, especially if it is built overland through Saint John.
So this letter of comment comes full circle and ends, as it started, with consideration of the public interest.
I have no objection to the building of the Brunswick Pipeline but I object strenuously to its being routed through the
City of Saint John, with the added risk and inconvenience to residents this involves, instead of along the CCNB marine
route, for the sole benefit of the applicants. I respectfully suggest that the N.E.B. grant the Brunswick Pipeline
application provided that the pipeline follows the CCNB marine route to Coleson Cove.

Opposition to the Brunswick Pipeline Project's proposal to build a 30" NG pipeline through Rockwood Park.
We reject this proposal to build a pipeline through one of the City of Saint John's tourist destinations. The
construction project is diametrically opposed to the work currently underway to rejuvinate the park. Rockwood
provides a natural haven for residents and guests. Greenspaces in many cities in Canada are at a premium. This
space should remain protected at all costs.
There is only one option. Build an underwater pipeline.

I am a resident of East Saint John and live very near the Irving Refinery. I object strongly to the proposed pipeline
running through the city especially the intended route through the refinery site. Having a 30" natural pipeline with
over 1400 PSI running next to large refinery stacks that flare every day, to me, is asking for an accident. If this pipeline
must exist it has to be run under the bay for the sake of all 69,000 plus residents of this city.
Sincerly

I object to the proposed gas pipeline's land route through Saint John. I live in East Saint John where we are subjected
to the dangers of refinery emissions and the real threat of an explosion. Now this same company wants to place us
further in danger by running a highly volitile gas pipeline through the same property. Please refuse such a request. It
does nothing for the city except place the residents in danger.
thank You

  I live in Red Head where the LNG facility is being built and where the LNG tankers are going to dock. Now they want
a pipeline to distribute the regasified gas. If we must put up with these huge tankers coming in with LNG then why
can't the gas go out the same way.
    Saint John is being used for this project because we are preceived as poor and needing jobs. The area may need
jobs but at what expense. My understanding is that only a handful of jobs will be the end result of this project all of
them being highly qualified positions. My inclination is that none of these jobs will go to residents of this city. That
being said what is the benefit?
  I deserve, as a citizen of Canada, to be treated with respect. I deserve to live in an area that I enjoy without the fear
of industry moving in and disrupting my quality of life.
  I implore the members of the National Energy Board to consider the people of Saint John and their collective
opposition to this project.

I have read with interest the discussion regarding the placement of the pipeline.
After looking at all the information I would like to support the Rockwood Park route. I have personally gone out to the
site and feel the addition of the pipeline and susquent cosmetic work done would enhance the park. Also, one of the
other proposed routes would have the pipeline coming close to my home.
My preferred route is the Rockwood Park route.

I live in Red Head and I disagree with a pipeline stretching from East to West through the city.
 We do not want this danger in our community. The constant blasting during construction will not only distrupt our
peaceful surroundings, it will also damage our homes. The fear of an accident when it is complete keeps most
residences of East Saint John on edge.
Please do not permit this injustice to happen to the residences of this city.

I do not want this 30" pipeline in Saint John. There has been very little attention paid to the people of East Saint John.
We have most of the pollution from heavy industry. We are the ones that will stand at our front doors and watch the
huge LNG tankers come in to canaport and we are the ones that will have to deal with a catastophy when an accident
happens with the pipeline on refinery land.
Please Stop this from happening

Good Day
 I live in the Randolph-Milford area,I am very concerned with the idea of a natural gas pipe line running under the
only access road that we have in this area.This would put this community in grave danger in the case of an accident
,and history shows accidents do happen.Iwould ask you to be very concerned with the health and safty of our
community.And do not allow this pipeline through our community. Gordon White

National Energy Board Panel Re: Emera Pipeline Project, Saint John N.B.
    When first confronted with the Emera Pipeline Co. Ltd.’s N.E.B. Application and Appendix (1-11) to construct its
“preferred” overland natural gas pipeline through Saint John from the proposed Irving regassification plant at
Canaport, the individual Saint John citizen and stakeholder or voluntary group of interested citizens who might wish
to better understand the companies design decisions and its socio-economic effects on their city will be rudely
brought up short or, at the very least be intimidated by the excruciating detail of the application and assessment and
their daunting technical length. Together they represent not so much a Caballa as a confusing road map couched as
 they are in arcane engineering expression and sometimes misleading information, which seems more like
obfuscation than illumination. Though with expert outside help they are not an impenetrable tome, but at the very
least they would intimidate or appear to be a hopeless read to the average stakeholder.
     Besides the fundamental difficulty that the individual stakeholder would have in understanding the contents of the
application, and the assessment report, one must also add as well the secrecy and delay with which they were made
available to the public at large. Though the contractual partners to the Application and their legal staffs have no
doubt adhered assiduously to the N.E.B. guidelines, where by the late months of 2005 and in the early part of 2006,
they have been able to proceed unobtrusively if not secretively to secure their positions with municipal officials and
by the effective use of nuanced propaganda put forth by the only daily newspaper outlet and major public news
testament available to the Saint John citizens and thus carefully insinuate their proposal in the public mind. This is a
unique situation that confronts the members of the N.E.B. panel. Nowhere else in Canada today does such a media
situation exist as the effete Davey Senate Committee Hearings on media combinations discovered forty years ago.
Not only does the same situation obtain today as it did then but one of the signatories to the proposed pipeline is the
same sole owner of that newspaper outlet. If the panel members of the N.E.B. board do not recognize the coercive
nature of the circumstances one must conclude deliberate myopia is at play or at the very least the intrusion of a
gentle shoulder. Personally I find it hard to believe that such pressure exists in this board’s hearing. The adherence
to the N.E.B. Act has been up to now scrupulously maintained, upheld by both the applicants and the members of the
information intervention panels provided by the N.E.B. But. And this is the rub. The adherence to the same
procedural rules is what provides an inequality. The rules to proceed dictate that the proponents and the intervener
critic must be the same. But here is where the inequality exists, in the financial and the information status of the two
camps. Multimillion-dollar business corporations and volunteer stakeholders are not equal in respect to resources and
knowledge of the process. The process and in particular the process in Saint John, New Brunswick is flawed and that
aberration weighs heavily in favour of the business corporation and its application.

I am writing in opposition of the proposed pipeline route through Saint John, NB.
I am a resident of Saint John and my home lies within 350 meters of the proposed route.
I want to clarify that I am not opposed to the pipeline, but the route being proposed.
Based on the information provided to the residents from representatives of the pipeline company, the two deciding
factors for the proposed route are costs, and scheduling (timing for completion).
 No economic feasibility has been presented or, to my knowledge, completed by an independent third party.
Today the costs for an alternative route may not be cost effective. The issue not being discussed is the forecasted
return on this pipeline over its useful life not just the economic life.
If the economic viability uses the current market value for the end product and does not include the forecasted
increases, the viability equation would change dramatically.
Fuel and energy costs have increased dramatically over the past two years with no clear end in sight.
Global demand is forecasted to continue as China and India becomes significant consumers. This will only increase
the end value of the finished product.
To say that an alternative route would end the project is threat that does not make economic sense.
The demand will continue to grow and prices will continue to increase. At some point, it will be feasible and even
profitable just as the tar sands in Alberta have.
My point is that as a resident the short term increased costs of an alternative route is a one time issue.
Today's cost and a company's schedule should not impact a community for 50 + years when an alternative is
available.
I hope that you will consider all of these issues when making the evaluation of the proposal.
Yours truly,
Donna Mazerolle

Mr. Michel Mantha
Secretary, National Energy Board
444 Seventh Ave., SW
Calgary, AB T2P 0X8
September 11, 2006
 Dear Mr. Mantha,
I am submitting this Letter of Comment regarding Emera Brunswick Pipeline Ltd.’s Brunswick Pipeline Project
(Hearing order GH-1-2006), on behalf of the Canadian Parks and Wilderness, New Brunswick Chapter.
The Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, New Brunswick Chapter (CPAWS New Brunswick) is the provincial
branch of the national non-government charitable organization, the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society. Integral
to CPAWS NB’s mission is the objective to ensure that parks and protected areas in New Brunswick are managed to
conserve the ecological integrity of the ecosystems within their boundaries. We also encourage the conservation of
our province’s biodiversity through the management of lands and waters outside protected areas in a manner that
complements the management of parks and protected areas.
One aspect of the Brunswick Pipeline Project that is of significant concern to CPAWS New Brunswick is the preferred
corridor that has been identified to go through Rockwood Park, in the City of Saint John. CPAWS does not believe
that pipeline construction, or any industrial development, is compatible with the management of parks.
The fact that the proposed Brunswick Pipeline would run beside an existing hydroelectric corridor in the park does
not avoid the principle that industrial development is not an appropriate land use in a park. When the hydro corridor
was constructed, the implications of habitat fragmentation on a natural area were not well understood, and
cumulative ecological impacts were rarely considered. CPAWS New Brunswick is concerned that the development
corridor proposed by the Brunswick Pipeline Project, by widening the existing corridor, will compound the existing
fragmentation caused by the corridor. In addition, a decision to allow the pipeline to follow the old corridor will likely
set a precedent for further widening of the corridor by future projects, even though we now understand the
implications of habitat fragmentation on a wide range of plants and animals. Rockwood Park is one of the largest
urban wildlands in North America, and further fragmentation of its ecosystems will surely compromise its value for the
wildlife that now find refuge in its habitats.
CPAWS New Brunswick believes it is important that the project proponent prove how the proposed pipeline, both
during and after construction, will not exacerbate the fragmentation caused by the existing hydro corridor, and that
cumulative ecological impacts of pipeline construction and maintenance of the right-of-way have been avoided.
CPAWS New Brunswick is very concerned that the preferred corridor runs through the southern edge of the Loch Alva
Protected Natural Area (which is called the “Loch Alva Protected Area” in the project document “Final Report Volume
1 of 2: Environmental & Socio-Economic Assessment - Brunswick Pipeline Project, Project No. 1003790, May 2006”).
Protected Natural Areas (PNAs), as legally designated by the New Brunswick Protected Natural Areas Act, have been
established to contribute to the protection of biological diversity in the Province of New Brunswick. Protected Natural
Areas permanently prohibit industrial activity, which would include the proposed pipeline.
The Loch Alva PNA protects one of the largest roadless wilderness areas in southern New Brunswick, in addition to
conserving a key drinking water supply area for the City of Saint John.
On page 326 of the above mentioned environmental assessment report, the mitigative suggestion with respect to the
Protected Natural Area is, “…there will not be a substantive loss of sensitive natural features (i.e. less than 10%) as
found in ESAs or the Loch Alva Protected Area as a result of the project.” CPAWS New Brunswick believes it is
crucial that the National Energy Board ensure there will be no loss of any natural features from the Loch Alva
Protected Natural Area, as the Protected Natural Areas Act dictates that the corridor route selection and right-of-way
avoid the PNA entirely. It is not in the best interest of the citizens of New Brunswick for any land to be developed in
the Loch Alva Protected Natural Area.
It is also very important to the goal of conserving our province’s biodiversity that corridor route selection avoid the
ESAs (Environmentally Significant Areas) in the preferred route. For those ESAs that cannot be avoided, the
proponent must ensure that the natural features are protected, both during construction and during maintenance of
the right-of-way.
Parks and protected areas are not plentiful in New Brunswick – only 3.4% of the province is located in permanently
designated parks or protected areas. Given this fact, CPAWS New Brunswick believes that the proposal to develop in
these few areas cannot over-ride the role they play in conserving the province’s natural ecosystems in perpetuity.
 CPAWS New Brunswick urges the National Energy Board to ensure that the Brunswick Pipeline avoids the Loch Alva
Protected Natural Area, Rockwood Park and the ESAs located along the preferred route.
Sincerely,
Roberta Clowater
Executive Director
Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, New Brunswick Chapter

         EMERA BRUNSWICK PIPELINE PROJECT
 HEARING DOCKET no. GH-1-2006
        -------------------
            Last June 19th 2006, we travelled to Saint John to attend a 225 + person meeting held by the Friends of
Rockwood Park. The Friends oppose adamantly this 1700 metre wide gas pipeline footprint which proposes to cut
through the heart of Rockwood Park and the City of Saint John. At this meeting we heard evidence, oral and written,
from Mr. Horst Sauerteig who is a retired gas pipeline engineer. The immediate destruction of Nature and Human
habitat, along with its continuing long term risks, is NOT balanced both by demonstrable public convenience and
necessity.
        Having just explained the WHO WHAT WHERE and WHEN of our solidarity to Friends of Rockwood Park, we
jointly wish to explain WHY:
1. In its 2001 Hudson Township(Quebec) decision, the Supreme Court of Canada introduced and applied into
Canadian law the international precautionary principle. Where substantive risks to Nature and Human Beings prevail
in a particular course of action, it is best to withhold its authorization. A corollary is that industrial promoters carry
the onus of proof that extant risks can be mitigated or obviated. If the current Mackenzie Gas Pipeline(MGP) hearings
are an indication of abject failure of promoters to discharge this onus of proof, then the Emera Brunswick pipeline
project should be diligently dismissed.
2. Progressive transnational corporations now structure and plan investment projects with protocols calculating
green house gas (GHG) emissions consistent with the Kyoto Climate Treaty and related Protocol. According to
Canada’s Pembina Institute(Calgary, Alta.) Canadian corporate promoters are likewise adopting these generally
accepted GHGs pre-investment calculations. Apart from effects on climate heating and transformation these GHG
emissions negatively affect the health of human and natural life located in their immediate and distant environment.
No amount of ¨¨proposed¨¨economic job creation can balance or justify these negative impacts. Conclusion: NEB,
please do dismiss diligently this project.
3. An August 2006 published article by Hilary Bain Lindsay, ¨Last Gas¨, refers to international scientific research from
the Post Carbon Institute. Other international scientists such as Dr. Paul Sears of Ottawa say the same thing: natural
gas and petroleum reserves are quickly depleting. Moreover on any given project proof of natural gas substitution for
dirtier fossil fuels must be adduced. Again judging from the ongoing MGP hearings, industrial promoters fail to
prove this substitution, or even as indicates Ian Doig with his close to 50 years’ experience in the energy field, they do
not adequately demonstrate proven reserves. This lack of transparency on the promoters’ part fails to discharge the
standard of public convenience and necessity; it therefore behooves the NEB to dismiss this application.
4. The natural gas volatility risks to all natural and human life in close and distant proximity to pipelines and
installations(i.e. blow outs and fires) seemed obvious, as explained to us by Mr. Horst Sauerteig June 19th last. If one
consults Internet reports from US Regulatory Agencies this becomes much more obvious. In Ms Bain Lindsay’s article
above, it was mentionned that US citizens wished no more to carry these devastating risks from natural gas pipeline
installations causing gas blow outs and fires. Likewise neither should Saint John and southwest New Brunswick
citizens be expected to carry these very same risks.
      Respectfully submitted EARLIER BY FAX this September 12th 2006, ( WITH A REQUEST TO BE EXCUSED FROM
MULTIPLE FILING, the efile procedure having aborted on us in due course). If efile eventually works, we will e-mail
tomorrow(13,09,06) this submission to the other four parties as required.

I am a resident of East Saint John and I wish to express my opposition to the proposed Emera pipeline project. There
is a perfectly good route ( under the bay) for this pipeline to accomplise it's purpose without endangering the general
population. This pipeline is of no benefit to the citizens of this city and therefore the request to construct should and
must be denied.

I oppose this gas pipeline through the city and Rockwood Park. I am a resident of the city and feel we, the citizens,
should have our voices heard. There are over 16,000 signatures on a petition objecting to the pipeline route.
Government must listen to the people and not just look at the economic benefits to a large corporation. These
economic benefits, by the way, will not be forth coming to the citizens of Saint John or even the municipality.
Thank you for allowing me to express my opposition

I oppose the pipeline going through Rockwood park and ideed the whole city. I enjoy spending time in the park and
feel it is an injustice to residents for commerical interests to disrupt an important feature of our city. With the amount
of pollution from heavy industry in this city, the trees are a natural cleansing that is required to allow us to breathe.
thank you

I oppose the construction of a 30" export high pressure pipeline through the city of Saint John.
  My concern is the constant infringement upon my right to a peaceful existance. The LNG facility was a done deal
before many of us had an opportunity to express our concerns. To add insult to injury our City fathers and the N.B.
Provincial government gave away any financial benefit to the city from this project. Now this same company (Irving
and repsol)and the pipeline company(Emera) propose a pipeline through our city. Enough is Enough.
There is no economic benefit to the people of this area. All we have to look forward to is the very real possibility of a
catastrophe. I live in Red Head and dread the completion of the LNG facility along with watching huge LNG tankers
coming into canaport. I am elderly and wish to spend the last years of my life in peace and quite. I do not want to
spend my years worrying how my wife and I will survive if an accident happens in the harbour, at the facility or on the
 pipeline, which by the way, all very near my home.
Please consider the residents of this great city when you make your decision.
Yours Truly
Doug Scott

 I DO NOT want a 30" high pressure pipeline to go through Saint John. The information on this project is in short
supply. You see nothing negative about it in the daily newspaper. This, of course, should not be a surprise to anyone.
 Saint John has the largest municipal park in the country. It is untouched beauty that is the envy of other cities. I
wonder out loud if the people of Halifax would allow this to happen to Point Pleasant Park or if the citizens of
Vancouver would even be approached to allow such a crime to happen to Stanley Park.
    I can not believe,in this day and age when the environment is considered an important topic, that destroying a
natural park would ever be considered.
    Besides the Park issue how can a country allow its citizens to be placed in danger for the benefit of commerce.
There is a alternative to this maddness. Please ensure that the company is denied the land route through Saint John
 and forced to spend a few extra dollars and place this pipeline where it belongs UNDER THS BAY.

 I disapprove of the notion that Saint John will host a huge high pressure gas pipeline. I have no idea how the city of
Saint John and the Province allowed this proposal to even get as far as the National Energy Board. This is an ill
conceived idea that benefits no one in this city expect the Irving corporation. Over the years this corporate citizen has
slowly but surely infringed on the rights and quality of life once enjoyed by the people.
   This should not be allowed to run through highly populated areas. If the Americans need gas so much let them
build more LNG terminals and pipelines through their cities. I realize that the Irvings could not make a profit this way,
however, that is not my concern. My concern is for the safety of my family and indeed all the citizens of Saint John.

   I strongly oppose an export gas pipeline through the city of Saint John. This line is of no financial benefit to the
city.
   We gave away any economic benefit this project might have generated when the city gave the LNG terminal a
hugh tax break for 25 years.
 Safety is far more pressing an issue to me than the so called financial benefits. There are no emergency measure in
place(the company says these will be coming, when is NEVER answered ). Our fire fighting ability is in question when
and if it is required to tackle a gas explosion, especially near or on the refinery grounds.
  I ask that the National Energy Board reject this proposal.

I oppose the gas pipeline going through Rock wood Park. I live in the north end of the city and enjoy spending time in
the park. This park was given to the citizens of Saint John and should not be sacrificed for the Irvings or the American
need for energy.
Thank You

  I oppose the large gas pipeline that is intended to go through Saint John. I live in East Saint John and feel the
danger associated with this project to too great considering the proposed corridor through the Irving refinery site. If a
leak in the line should occur near or in the refinery an explosion would devastate this community.
  If the company feels it must transport its product on a pipeline it should run under the bay. If it is NOT too dangerous
for LNG tankers I fail to see why it is too dangerous for a pipeline. The fact that a land route is cheaper for the
company to construct should not have any bearing on the decision you are being asked to make.

I do not want this pipeline in Saint John. .
 I live in Red Head where I must endure the LNG facility. This fact along is frightening enough, now they want to place
a pipeline through the city to carry this very volitile product to market in the U.S.A.
I say no and I hope my voice counts for something considering it is added to over 16,000 other Saint Johners who feel
the exact same way.
We say UNDER THE BAY OR NO WAY...

Re : National Energy Board Hearing on the Brunswick Pipeline Application
Dear Sir/Madame,
Saint John Construction Association Inc is an accredited employers organization in the province of New Brunswick
representing over 600 contractors who are signatory to union collective agreements in the building and construction
industry. As part of our longstanding mandate, the Association has been heavily involved in economic growth issues
affecting the community of Saint John, in particular, and New Brunswick in general.
 Many of the contractors which we represent, and their employees who are members of New Brunswick Building and
Construction Trades Council local union living in this community will benefit both directly and indirectly from the
construction of the Brunswick Pipeline as per the application of Emera Inc.
As we understand the application, the pipeline will transport regasified LNG from the Canaport LNG facility, when
constructed, to its market destination. If the pipeline is not built, the Canaport LNG facility will not be built. These
construction projects are valued at approximately $ 1 Billion in investment in this region. Construction employment
and the subsequent economic spin-off effects to this region are considerable.
We believe Emera Inc. and Brunswick Pipeline’s proposed route through the City of Saint John and Rockwood Park is
the optimum choice. Emera has a solid record of responsible management and high quality community involvement
and we trust their record of dealing with environmental, safety and other potential community issues will be mirrored
in this region as it has in others.
This project will further diversify the energy base of the region, complimenting the economy with a secure supply of
natural gas. I twill serve to stimulate further economic development and generate increase tax revenue for the City of
Saint John as well as the adjacent regions.
In closing, we wish to state that we believe this project will be a positive addition to the province of New Brunswick
and City of Sant John.

I am writing to object to the proposed building through the city of Saint John a pipeline to carry natural gas under
pressure to the American border.
The proposed route for the pipeline passes through highly populated neighbourhoods, Rockwood Park, and passes
near a hospital, nursing home, and many businesses. Although the probability of an explosion may not be high, the
consequences of such and explosion would be devestating.
Although I live in Quispamsis, I work on University Avenue at a nursing home. The nursing home is just far enough
away from the proposed pipeline to be vulnerable and quite possibly we would not be able to evacuate our residents
in the event of an explosion or even a major leak. The Saint John Regional Hospital is also located on University
Avenue. Access to the hospital could be compromised if an explosion were to occur within the city.
 The right of way for the pipeline plus 30 meters on either side is a large swath to run through the city. I fear this
would interfere with important upgrades to existing infrastructure, such as water and sewage lines.
I feel this pipeline does nothing for the people of people of New Brunswick. It is being built to feed the insatiable
American appetite for energy and the greed of local business. Maine residents have objected to the LNG terminal
there, yet the people of N.B. are expected to take the risk of, not only having the terminal, but also a lengthy pipeline
to provide the US with gas.
Methane (natural gas) leaking from the pipeline does not dissipate into the air. It settles on the ground where it can
collect awaiting the inevitable spark. I understand that even arcing from powerlines overhead is sufficient to ignite
the gas. Methane can seep through cracks and open windows. In sufficient quantities, accumulated gas can cause
instantaneous death to a person entering the space without the need of a spark. Methane generated by manure
cellars has been known to cause such deaths.
Rockwood Park, although a small part of the proposed pipeline, is a jewel in the city of Saint John. It was given to
the city many years ago for the express purpose of recreation for the population. I come to the city frequently to enjoy
this wonderful space. The thought of an 85-meter wide gash through it is anathema to me. It must not be allowed to
be turned into an industrial park for the benefit of large business owners who can only visualize economic growth and
fail to count environmental and human costs.
Despite my objection to the pipeline in any locality, if it must be built (and I'm not sure that it must) the underwater
route, as proposed by the Friends of Rockwood Park and the Conservation Council of New Brunswick is the preferred
route. This still leaves the considerable overland distance from Lorneville to St. Stephen. There are lives at risk
along this route - not all of them human.
I request that this application to put a gas pipeline through the city of Saint John be denied and serious consideration
be given to the pipeline proposal altogether. The risk versus benefit is far too high.
Respectfully submitted,
Phyllis Hart

I was born and brought up just a few meters from Rockwood Park. My whole life has revolved around the park, that
was given to the residents of Saint John many years ago. I know all the trails as I walk them every day summer,
winter, spring and fall to enjoy the sudden appearence of deer with their young and other various wildlife, birds and
beautiful wildflowers. It was to my horror when I learned that an American company along with a local company
were proposing to build a 30" natural gas pipeline through my backyard[ Rockwood Park]and especially learned that
the gas was for the United States and of NO benefit to this city. I feel very deeply about the park and what the effects
the construction [blasting, machinery] will have on the animal population,the trees, water and life as we know it in the
park. We need all the green space that we have in this very dirty, industrial city and I feel strongly that much will be
lost if this construction is allowed to take place. I feel that if this is allowed more will follow and the park as we know
 it will NO longer be. Please listen to the residents of this of this city who do not want the DANGER and added stress of
perhaps having to lose their homes, that they have worked a lifetime to possess and STOP this pipeline. There is an
alternative and that is "Under the Bay". Please reconsider!

To: National Energy Board,
I am opposed to the Brunswick Pipeline coming through my land and as a resident of Milford. I also question how the
emergency personal would enter into the area if there was a leak near the Lou Murphy Overpass.
The pipeline is to come on land at pleasant point. I am the owner of this land. The HDD drilling will be very loud for
an extended period of time, not to mention all the machinery. When the pipeline comes assure it will be
aproxamitally 100 feet from my home. When I bought this property, I have plans for the land. In my opinion this
pipeline should not be running through residential areas.
 Sincerely,
Stella Richard

Brunswick Pipeline Project - letter of comment
September 12, 2006
Saint John, NB
I am a Registered Nurse and my primary occupation in addition to Nursing, is assisting refugee claimants in their
settlement and claim process. I am involved and interested on matters that affect human rights.
I have several concerns with the building of the pipeline through the City of Saint John. I oppose the building of this
pipeline on several points:
- The disruption that will cause to the citizens of Saint John’s lives. Whether this pipeline is built, either, across the
 park or the city, it will cause serious disruptions on the lives of people who live alongside the route, such as noise,
damage to property from blasting, traffic closures, depreciation of their property, -for some even loss of property-etc.
I do not believe that these problems are to be imposed on people who will not benefit at all from the project. The
pipeline is being built to transport liquified natural gas to the United States. The companies involved are the only
ones who will obtain financial gains from the project.
- The pipeline poses a risk to all the people who live alongside the route and to all citizens of Saint John, as no one
can guarantee it to be free of risk of leakage, rupture or even an explosion.
In addition, if any accident was to happen, the costs both in human suffering and emergency response professionals
and materials will be left to us as citizens of Saint John.
- The company proposing to build this pipeline has closed its mind to the interests of citizens by not considering the
alternate marine route in spite of reassurances from an expert who has built and managed the Canaport terminal and
who explained the safety of a marine route. This shows that the company is set in its plans and that the rights and
concerns of the people do not matter.
- The local print media has been biased in its coverage towards the companies and has not provided balanced
information to its readers. This has prevented some people from learning the facts to be considered. This infringes
on the right of free press on issues that have serious implications on the lives of citizens. People and groups who
have spoken against the building of the pipeline trough Rockwood Park, have been ridiculed and put down by people
that the newspaper has chosen to publish only their views.
- There has not been involvement from our city leaders to measure and think over the possibility of emergency
measures that will be needed to activate if such a project goes ahead. This lack of leadership should concern your
Board as they are the ones who should be looking to protect the citizenry.
I believe that projects such as this one, should be decided by the communities that will be affected. Our community
has spoken loud with a petition that has been signed by thousands of citizens who oppose the building of the pipeline
across the park. We live in a democracy and the people who are affected are the ones to decide on these issues, not
the corporations.
The pipeline is being built by Emera. Emera is the parent company of Nova Scotia Power (NSP) and the Atlantic
Regional Solidarity Network (ARSN) has a campaign against NSP showing that their purchase of Colombian coal links
them to human rights abuses in Colombia. I am also attaching information on NSP and Colombian human rights
abuses that can be found in the Mining the Connections section of ARSN's website at: www.arsn.ca
I am also opposed to the terminal as the company who has partnered with Irving -Repsol- carries a poor human rights
record in the countries where it operates. The terminal is linked to the pipeline and the pipeline cannot operate
without it.
Repsol is a minority partner with Occidental Petroleum and Ecopetrol (Colombia's state oil company) in the Cano
Limon oil field and pipeline in the province of Arauca in Colombia. As a partner, it is obviously complicit in all the
human rights violations that have occurred to protect the operations of the oil field and pipeline, including the
massacre of civilians for which Occidental is currently defending itself in U.S. Federal Court. I have attached a copy
of the Colombia chapter in Gary Leech’s new book (Crude Interventions, The United States, Oil and the New World
(Dis)Order) that addresses these issues. Because the book focuses on the US, he only mentions Occidental, but Repsol
is a partner to everything Occidental is involved in that is mentioned in the book. Information on these human rights
abuses can be found on pages 135-137 and the section beginning on page 151 titled The Oil War in Arauca.
With all these issues of concern, I urge you to deny permission to these transnational corporations to build a pipeline
through our city.

Re: NEB Hearing on the Brunswick Pipeline application
Dear Board Members:
I am writing on behalf of the membership of the New Brunswick Building and Construction Trades Council (NBBCTC)
to express our support for the application, submitted by Emira, Inc., to build a 30” natural gas pipeline from Saint
John, NB to Maine. As you know, the proposal is to construct a land-based pipeline that will run from the Canaport
LNG terminal now under construction in East Saint John, through the city and on to Baileyville, Me.
The NBBCTC supports this application for a number of reasons. First, there are the economic spin-offs. Reports
show that the pipeline and the LNG terminal together represent new private sector investment in our region of over $1
billion. Obviously, construction of the pipeline will not only bring jobs to the region – many of which will be in the
trades represented by our Council – but will also result in other economic benefits as the people who fill those jobs
become taxpayers and consumers in the region.
The new pipeline will also ensure a long-term, secure and diverse supply of natural gas for our region, something that
will be of value not only to homeowners but also to businesses. Further economic development, both in terms of
conversion projects and new construction, is also sure to result.
Of course, the land route proposed by Emira will result in increased tax revenues for the City of Saint John, something
that is sorely needed as the municipality faces infrastructure challenges and increased demand for facilities to serve
its citizens.
Our observations have shown Emira to be a well-established, reputable business that has a solid track record of
responsible management and community involvement. We firmly believe that the company would be a positive
addition to the local community both in terms of its potential to create jobs and contribute to the economy and in
terms of its prospects as a good corporate citizen.
The City, the region’s various economic development organizations, and most businesses and citizens in the greater
Saint John area are fully behind the True Growth concept of promoting community development by balancing and
blending business and quality of life potential. We of the New Brunswick Building and Construction Trades Council are
also fully supportive of this concept and as such view the Brunswick Pipeline as a positive addition to the community.
We encourage you to do the right thing and approve construction of the pipeline in Saint John, and we thank you for
the opportunity to voice our opinion.
Sincerely,
Gary Ritchie, President
NB Building & Construction Trades Council

To: National Energy Board,
I am a resident of Milford Road and I am opposed to the proposed route to run this pipeline through the city and
residential areas.
 The pipeline will be coming on land at pleasant point and the HDD drilling is going to be 24 hours a day for a long
period of time. We as residents must tolerate the noise, machines and it seems be expected to keep our windows
closed for the duration of the HDD drilling.
 This is not acceptable for a company to have residents live indoors so they can run a pipeline that has no benefit to
the citizens. The exit point to HDD drilling will be aproxamitally 94 meters from my home. As a resident of the area I
 am well aware of the sounds that travel.
When speaking with the company, they did not mention the HDD drilling noise, the period of time it would take, the
noise levels we are expected to tolerate, or that it would be going on for 24 hours a day.
It appears that the company’s representatives have not told the residents all of the facts.
I hope that you, the NEB, will take this into consideration before allowing this pipeline through our community. I
would also like to say that we work different shifts. How will this affect our work and state of mine?
My last comment is that the company has said that any problems will be dealt with through ongoing mitigations.
Information to this point has not been accurate. What faith can we, as residents, have in the future mitigations when
we have a complaint about noise or other issues? Credibility does not exist based on past experience.
Yours Truly,
Doreen Clark

I am interested/concerned with the proposed brunswick pipeline because it will run within a few hundred meters of
my house and near the schools that my children attend. As well, I have a concern for citizens in other areas of Saint
John. In addition, Emera mentions property taxes that would be payable to the City Of Saint John. Since the city of
Saint John has a serious financial situation, any additional revenue is important.
For areas within Saint John, Emera (or the pipeline operator) needs to set up a system which can automatically close
valves when a drop in gas pressure is detected in the pipeline. As well, the NEB should review the number of valve
stations planned for Saint John to ensure that there is enough and that they are located in the most appropriate
locations to ensure minimum deaths/injuries if a rupture of the pipe occurs.
 The approval process must ensure that the City of Saint John receives direct payments from Emera (either through
property taxes or some other fashion) for the risks and additional costs that its citizens would be taking with a pipeline
running through the city. The City will bear additional costs in preparing to handle an accident, let alone recovery
from one. The approval process must ensure that the City of Saint John is directly and substantially compensated for
this risk/cost.
Adequate saveguards must be in place to reduce the loss of life if the pipeline is ruptured. Even though the likelihood
is low for a rupture, the damage and deaths could be very high with the 'destruction zone' extending out several
hundred meters from the pipeline (according to the documentation provided by Emera).
The Pipleine company must have an automated system set up to close valves in case of a rupture to the pipeline.
They can't depend on human intervention since this would result in excessive delays. According to the documents
filed by Emera, the largest damage area occurs in the first minutes of a leak/rupture, so closing the valves several
minutes to 15 minutes later does not reduce the damage area substantially. The documents submitted by Emera state
that the gas pressure will be monitored for drops in pressure and that they have the capability to remotely shut valves.
So implementing an automatic system which could shut valves within seconds of a drop in gas pressure should be
relatively simple and inexpensive. But it could save many lives in the event of a rupture.
The possibility of someone purposely rupturing the pipeline can not be discounted. As well, the Pipeline will be
routed through areas (such as roads) where digging may occur. So the probabilities quoted in the filings are some
what irrelevant. The important question is the damage and deaths caused by a rupture and what can be done to
reduce this.
Emera must also have safeguards in place to protect the valve stations. These will be locations in which the gas
pipeline is the easiest to vandalize, or destroy (for a terrorist attack). The valve sites must be well secured and
alarmed.

I am writing this letter of comment because I am opposed to the Brunswick pipeline running through our
neighborhood.
I am a resident of the Milford area, and have been for the past 29 years.
The pipeline will be running very near people’s homes. Milford consists of mostly rock, therefore significant blasting
will probably have to take place. This will leave resident’s homes venerable for cracked foundations, cracked
windows, and other damage.
All through Milford there is an abundant of wildlife (deer, raccoons, etc.) and blueberry fields, how will this affect
them, and will they be able to return to normal?
The pipeline will be running right behind our playground and ball-field. On an average day there are plenty of
 children that use these facilities. In the event f a pipeline accident they will be put at risk.
There was once an old dump on Milford Road. From my knowledge there were a lot of things that were buried in this
area. When digging and blasting for the pipeline occur here, what might come to the surface, and will it be safe?
The pipeline will also run right behind our church, very near our senior’s complex, close to our elementary and our
middle school.
In the Milford area we have an active rock quarry, where significant blasting occurs. How will this have an effect on
the pipeline? Has there ever been another 30 inch high pressured export gas pipeline placed within ¼ of a mile from
an active rock quarry? If so, has there ever been any test done to see if the blasting has any effect on the pipeline in
any way?
The pipeline is proposed to run underneath our over-pass, which is our only exit in and out of area. In the event of a
pipeline accident here, we would be unable to have emergency vehicles enter and we would not have access to get
out. On a nice day in the summer, Dominion Park in the Randolph area entertains thousands of people; they would
also be cut off from the rest of the city if there was ever a pipeline accident near the over-pass.
These are some of the reasons I oppose having this pipeline run through our neighborhood. The residents of our area
have the right to safety and security, and unless you could be 100% sure that a pipeline incident would never happen
here, and then it would be taken away.
Sincerely
Sheila Curwin

Letter of comment:
Brunswick Pipeline Project
GH-1-2006
June 23, 2006
I am writing opposing the proposed pipeline to run through Saint John. I am a resident of Milford and I believe that if
there was a leak in this line, that we would not be able to evacuate or have emergency personal access to the area as
 we have only one exit and entrance and the line will be running under that road or bridge area.
 The line is proposed to run very close to homes in the area. I am very surprised that any company would suggest
running such a large line with the 1440 pounds of pressure through residential areas. When you read on the Interstate
Natural Gas Association of Americas, public education page on the internet it states.” Leave the area, warn others, do
not light a match, start an engine, use a telephone in the area, operate a light switch or do anything that may create a
spark. I believe that this proposal is an accident waiting to happen.
I do not see any benefit of this line to us the residents except the danger. The gas will be sent to the USA for there
benefit and the benefit of the company. Residents in this area are very upset and fearful with the thought of this
proposal. This line will also be passing by the Pulp and Paper Mill. What if there was a fire in either the mill or
pipeline what kind of destruction will occur if one interferes with the other and how many lives would be lost? We
also have Bald Hill Quarry where blasting is done. I live approximately one mile from the quarry and on June 19, 2006
at 10:19 my house shook, my stove raddled. This pipeline is to be approximately ¼ mile from the quarry, what kind of
cracking will the movement of land have on the line.
The stress of living in fear of a leak in my neighbourhood is not what I want for my family or neighbours. As I said, we
will have to live with the danger and thought that an accident could happen any time, twenty four hours a day. In my
opinion this will be taking away the quality of life as I enjoy it today.

I am writing this letter in opposition of the pipeline going through the City of Saint John, New Brunswick. I am strongly
opposed of this route because of the safety issues involved. It is my understanding that this supposed 30 inch pipeline
will be up routing our neighbourhoods, roads, our lives as citizens of Saint John. I am a mother of 4 young children
and it is their safety that I am worried about. This supposed pipeline will be running in behind their schools, and I am
not comfortable with this! There are just too many things that can contribute to an accident...and there are too many
LIVES at risk for my liking!!! I would like to know what training was/is issued for the Fire Dept., Police Dept., and local
Hospitals in case of a accident or DISASTER?..because at this time it is my understanding that there is NONE!!!!! There
are just too many unanswered questions at this time to approve this Pipeline! Thank you Terra Dunham, Saint John,
N.B.

As a teacher and a concerned citizen, I feel the proposed route through the city of Saint John NB is inappropriate
because of the danger of the explosion and higher cost to the city to install water and other pipelines in the future. I
would accept an underwater Bay of Fundy route. The majority of the population is against the route through the city.

I am writing this letter because I DO NOT want this supposed 30 inch pipeline going through my city. I do not want
this because of the safety I fear for my Great Grand children. It is my understanding that this pipeline will be running
behind thier schools and home!!!! This is unexceptable in my eyes and I would like to see my Great Grand kids be
able to have a healthy and SAFE environment!!!! Thank you

I am writing this letter in Strong opposition of this supposed 30 inch pipeline going through the city of Saint John! I
live in a very polluted (Air) area of the city and don't feel that this pipeline construction will better my situation or
anyone else's. The blasting that will have to take place is dangerous, and we have already have had an incident in
regards to my power being dirupted, as a direct result of the LNG terminal being built. Accidents do happen!!!!!!!
Thank you

I am interested in the application since I live in Saint John and want to ensure that the pipeline is routed to avoid
populated areas where possible, in order to reduce the risk to the general public.
The NEB should consider an alternative location for the crossing of the St. John River, instead of the proposed Pokiok
to Pleasant Point crossing.
Emera filed information from AK Energy Services (FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT
OF HORIZONTAL DIRECTIONAL DRILLS FOR DUKE ENERGY’S M&N LNG #4 PROJECT Revised August 2, 2005) that
stated that alternatives to the proposed HDD crossing for the St. John River are feasible.
 In particular, I am referencing HDD #8a (Millidgeville to Greenhead Island crossing at entrance Millidgeville Waste
Water Treatment facility) and HDD #9a (Alternate Route Crossing between Grand Bay and South Bay). Both HDD
routes were identified as “Medium Risk”, i.e., feasible.
This alternative routing would avoid residential (and potential residential) areas that the proposed routing would go
through or nearby. The alternate route would avoid the following densely populated areas of Saint John that
proposed route from Emera would affect:
- Old North End of Saint John
- Milford
- Dever Road / Greendale
- Westside Estates / Glenwood Drive subdivisions
- Westgate
- Gault Road
- Fundyview Estates
It would also avoid isolating Milford/Randolf areas (in case of a rupture), which is a concern of some citizens with the
proposed routing.
Regardless of which HDD crossing locations are chosen, the pipeline should be routed to avoid residential areas as
much as possible (as well as areas that are prime for residential development).
In addition, the pipeline should not be routed underneath roads (except to cross them perpendicularly) since roads
are often dug up to repair water pipes, etc. In addition, road ways are generally lined with residential and business
developments, or will be in the future.

Gas Pipelines Deliver Practical Energy Source
For the last several months there has been much debate about the proposed natural gas pipeline that would connect
Canada’s first LNG terminal at Mispec Point with the an existing line in St. Stephen.
Natural gas is a clean burning energy source and it should be encouraged to replace coal and oil fired plants. The
risk factor for this type of pipeline is convincingly low as the armored pipelines are buried underground and are
closely monitored. Even when accidents occur like sloppy road builders hitting a pipe, the gas is lighter than air and
usually dissipates. I am tired of hearing the fear mongering over the route that would cross part of Saint John mostly
 along an existing power line corridor. These areas can be easily restored to their natural condition. The suggestion to
bury the pipeline under the Bay of Fundy is not a viable alternative. With our high tides and strong currents it would
present undue safety and technical challenges during construction, and the potential for future environmental
problems. Costs and labour risks render this alternative impractical and unworkable.
There is always an element of risk when generating electrical power. However, there is nothing new about natural
gas technology. It has safely existed throughout the world and in cities and parks all across North America for many
years. I spent a major part of my career in nuclear power plant construction and believe the more people understand
today’s power technology, the more they are comfortable with it.
The world has electrical generation and consumption problems; therefore all efficient and imaginative opinions
should be welcomed, including natural gas. Solar, tidal and wind power are certainly worthy options, but these
sources cannot presently meet the level of electrical energy required by modern day society. Conservation is also a
very important element in the energy discussion. The natural gas sector presents tremendous employment
opportunities for our region. Let’s be rational in our quest for future energy and enjoy the benefits of having
world-class power projects on our doorstep and not all in the west.

Safety ,would you want a 30 inch LNG line running threw your city! I could not sleep at night knowing what could
happen if there was and accident and people died because all i wanted to do was same a company money. I will not
waste anymoe of your time .Because I really believe the Irvings will get what they want they always do!

Sir. I am writing to you to voice my opposition to the proposed 30" pipeline that Emera Brunswick Pipeline Co.is
hoping to construct across Saint John and through Rockwood Park.Not only is this project a dangergerous one,but
distruction to our streets and neighborhoods.Please keep this in mind when considering Emera's applications.
Yours truly. Richard Barrett. Saint John. N.B.

What happens if there is a leak?

I am 13, and opposed to this pipeline as you are running your pipeline near our ballfield. This is important to us. What
happens if there is an explosion nearby?

no way out if anything was to happen.
Thanks for listening

I am writting to let you know that I am opposed to you running the pipeline through our area(Milford/Randolph) Safety
being the main reason, we have only one way out of Milford and if there was ever an accident with the pipeline we
would have no escape. How does one go to sleep with this hanging over there heads?

I am writting this letter to let you know that I'm opposed to your pipeline as it is running too near to my house. I will
not feel safe sleeping at night. Can you guarantee there will not be no explosions?

I'm writting in regards to the pipeline going through our area. I have grand children whom I enjoy taking to
Domminion Park. If we were at the beach one day and there was a pipeline accident, we would be stranded- no other
way out.

All seniors in the Milford area would not be able to get to saftey. The fire dept would be unable to provide any
security, due to the overpass. Any residents in this area would loose there property.

explosion near the overpass.

I am opposed to a 30" gas pipeline running through Saint John. My husband and I both work in the city & our children
attend a day care very near the pipeline route. Knowing that our children may be in danger from an explosion or leak
causes us to re-evaluate our current lifestyle.If this proposal is granted we have no choice but to leave the city. This is
a decision not taken lightly as our families all live here. I have 2 choices: take our children away from their
grandparents & extended families or risk their lives. Please consider my family as well as thousands of other families
when making your decision.

Re: Brunswick Pipeline crossing PID# 00272286 in Musquash, NB.
Brunswick Pipeline Company is planning to construct a pipeline from Saint John, N.B. to the New Brunswick-Maine,
USA border. This proposed pipeline is planned to cross my property PID# 00272286 in Musquash, NB.
 As the land owner of this property I object to this pipeline across my property.
The Brunswick Pipeline has no real economical gain to the region or myself.
This pipeline is solely for the profit of a private company.
The property I own was purchased to allow my family to experience rural living, develop a viable wood lot and
provide an inheritance to my three children. Since purchasing the property 16 years ago the New Brunswick
Department of Transportation has taken a portion of the property, plus in the process, abandoning approximately 2
acres of land between two highways with no retribution. New Brunswick Power took another portion for an expanded
power line. The New Brunswick Government through the influence of outside interest created an environmentally
protected area around the edge of my property making the property harder to access, Maritime North East Pipeline
took a portion of the property to construct the first pipeline to Saint John, New Brunswick. Irving Forest Services has
contracted the cutting of over 5000 acres of crown forest land next to my property.
    With the construction of first pipeline across my property (by Maritime Northeast Pipeline) my property has been
more accessible to off road vehicles, the company indicated that gates and fences would be constructed and
maintained. The gates were erected at the end of the construction phase but there is no evidence of maintenance
being performed on the gates or easement since the construction ended. This second pipeline will make my property
even more accessible to off road vehicles and allow better access for the theft of wood off of my property.
    In the 16 years of owning the property there has been a continuously stream of heavy equipment and construction
traffic on the access road in front of my house damaging the access road and disrupting my rural setting, which was
one of the main reasons I moved from the city.
    Since the announcement of the Brunswick Pipeline, my wife and I have had only one visit from Maritime and
Northeast Pipeline Ltd’s company representative. At that meeting the company indicated that it was reviewing
proposed routes for the pipeline and asked for permission for access and field studies, this permission has been given
for a period of 24 months ending August 08, 2007. These surveys were to conduct archaeological, environmental and
borehole investigations, survey measurements and staking( field studies). The agreement signed by Maritime and
Northeast Pipeline Ltd and myself indicated that after the surveys had been completed, the company shall notify the
Owner if the easement route is proposed to be located on the owner’s land. Since the signing of the permission on
August 08, 2005 there has been no communication from the pipeline company. If the surveys have been completed
then I no longer grant permission to the Brunswick Pipeline Company or any companies working for the Brunswick
Pipeline Company access to my property.
    The Brunswick Pipeline Company indicates that the pipeline is safe, there is thousands of hectors of crown land to
the north of my property where this pipeline could be constructed, thereby not affecting the property of private
landowners like myself.
    In conclusion I do not support the Brunswick Pipeline access across my property, and if the pipeline is to be
constructed then the pipeline should cross crown land thereby not affecting rural landowners.

I am opposed to the pipeline running through the city of Saint John. How will the residents be evacuated in the event
of an accident? What about the people who live in the Milford area? I have friends that live in that area how in gods
name will they get help or get out if a leak was to happen,where there is only one way in? The pipeline should be
away from all residental areas. I'm sure that the company could find another route that wouldn't put people at risk!

I am opposed to you running your pipeline through the Milford area, as my daughter lives there. Their only way out is
the "Lou Murphy Overpass". What if there is a gas leak?

My family lives in Red Head and the pipeline will go very close to our subdivision. There are many children in the
area. I fear for there safety knowing the possibility of an explosion due to leaks or ruptures in the pipeline. Also
worried about any spin offs from the LNG plant.

I do not want this pipeline going through our city because of the danger that could happen to the citizens of Saint
John. I think they should put it under the bay. I think they should listen to the citizens and approve the under water
route.

There should never be allowed to put a 30 inch pipeline through the city near hospitals, schools, churches,atc. I think
we are the only city in Canada that is being forced to put up with this especially the danger& enviroment& no benefit
to us only the United States. We were riped off with the LNG project and if they must have this discusting dangereous
deal. Then put it in the bay of Fundy, they have enough money from the tax rip off 5oo Million dollars for 25 years.
Which I feel is amble to put it in the bay where its safer.
Thank You

We are residents of Milford Road. The proposed pipeline is to run aproxamitally 200 to 300 feet behind our home on
Irving’s property. We were not aware of this pipeline until a neighbors came to our door informing us of this. Our
homes foundation is poured onto the bedrock. What is blasting going to do to our house? How will we be able to
sleep, with the thought that an accident could happen anytime? How will we deal with the stress of living so close to
this? When the company picked the route did they not consider the mental stress they will be putting on us the
residents? How will we be able to get out of the area, if we live through a leak that caches fire? What about all the
seniors who live here, the impact on there mental health, if we are feeling like this, and we are not seniors. The
company should be ashamed of themselves for even considering a pipeline through residential areas especially in the
Milford area, where there is one way in or out. Emergency personal would not be able to get in, if there is a leak near
 the overpass.
Why should we the residents live in fear?

I am opposed to your pipeline running through Milford area as I have family living there. If any leaks occure, their
only way out is the LOU Murphy overpass.

I am writing to let you know, I am opposed to the proposal of a 30 inch natural gas pipeline running through Milford
and the City. I am a resident of Milford Road and we have only 1 entrance into the area. That is our overpass. The
over pass was built in 1984 after 2 children died as the ambulance could not exit the area as a train was blocking the
road, at that time there was no overpass. I believe that if there was leaks anywhere near the overpass, we again
would be in the same situation that claimed the lives of the 2 Gifford children. We as residents pressured the
provincial government to have a safe access out of the area that would never be blocked again. Now it seem, here we
go again.
If this pipeline gets approval I certainly would hope that there will be another road put into the area to always allow
access out away from the pipeline as we are all aware that accidents do happen, as we are all aware in this area of
 innocent lives being lost that no one would of ever thought could happen, but it shore did and could happen!
 I am hoping that you the National Energy Board take this into consideration when making a decision that would affect
the residents who live beyond the overpass.
Sincerely,
Kenneth Jennings

I am opposed to the proposal for a 30 inch natural gas pipeline coming through our city and the neighborhoods. I am
a resident of Milford and I am very concerned that the pipeline will be running behind my home. There is only one
way out and that is the Louis Murphy overpass. I am also concerned that anyone who lives past Kingsville Road would
also be blocked in if there was a leak at that area. This pipeline will be here for many years and anything could
happen in the life of the pipeline. As a life long resident, I can’t believe that such a proposal of running a large
pipeline in residential areas is a benefit to any resident. The thought of not being able to get out at Kingsville Road
and the overpass is frightening, not to mention that emergency personal could not help us. As a senior the anxiety of
what is being proposed, not to mention if it goes through, how we will always have the fear of what if or when an
accident could happen.
 To me this is unacceptable danger in our neighborhood and should be rerouted.
Yours Truly,

My interest in the application of Emera putting a pipeline through the city is two-fold. I live within 2 miles of the
proposed route. If anything should happen and there is an explosion I am aware that the heat from that would be felt
as far away as two miles due to an incident that happened in Clark County Kentucky. I am concerned for the safety of
my children as well as myself and there is also an elementary school closer than my house to the proposed pipeline
route. The second concern I have is the interruption in use of Rockwood Park. It is a haven from the hustle and bustle
of everyday life in the city. I am also concerned about the wildlife and eco-system that this pipeline will disrupt.

I wish to express my opposition to the 30" export gas line proposed to run through Saint John. I am a resident of the
city and have been for many years. I am a senior citizen who wishes to leave to my children and grandchildren a city
they can be proud of and more importantly be safe in. We the citizens of this community do not want nor need this
intrusion in our city. Over sixteen thousand of us have signed a petition stating just that. I can not understand why our
concerns and voices are being ignored for the benefit of a few. I live in Saint John N.B. NOT Irvingville..
        Thank you
        Leonard Williams Citizen.

I wish to comment on the route that the pipeline will follow through Milford and the West side of Saint John. I have
lived in Saint John for 25 years, and I have witnessed the creation of the Church Street overpass to allow for fast
emergency response to the Milford peninsula. The 800 metre no pass zone which comes into effect in the event of a
pipeline accident will effectively cut off ANY access to the peninsula. I have too many friends living in that area to
stand by and do nothing. I am glad for this opportunity to voice my opinion and objection.
Furthermore, I have recently come to realise that any accident in the Ocean Westway area of the pipeline route will
effectively shut down ANY access to both of the highways leading out of the city from the West Side. Highways 1 and 7
converge in this area and both would be inaccessible in the enforced 800 metre exclusion zone.
These are serious flaws and need to be reexamined to avoid unnecessary risk to the citizens of Saint John.

I want to express my opposition to the 30" pipeline proposed to run through Saint John. There is no reason to
jeopardize the lives of the citizens of this city when the pipeline could easily be placed under the bay. Even if the
odds of an accident or explosion are minute, any chance taken with people's lives is unacceptable.

To National Energy Board.
 As a life long resident of the Milford area, I am writing to express my opposition to the Brunswick Pipeline Project.
We have one exit from this area and an accident could cause this exit to be distroyed. Our health and saftey is a
prime concern. We would not be able to access the hospital and would be cut off from help and assistance. There are
alternate paths for the pipeline as well as shipping the product. Please explore other options.

National Energy Board,                                   Sept.6, 2006
    My name is Ken Palmer, and I reside at 57 Milford Road. My ancestors first settled in the area around 1900, as has
many of my neighbors. Many of these long term residents and their ancestors have lived here for anywhere from 2-5
generations.
    The Milford/Randolph area is made up of many hard working families. There is roughly 6,000 adults over the age of
18 living in this area, plus an estimated guess of 750-1000 kids, under the age of 18. Then if you add the number of
 people who working in the area, plus kids attending daycare, community centers, ballfields, Dominion Park Beach
and daily church services. You have a significant amount of people living or visiting this area, at any given time.
    The area is serviced by only one entrance/exit, and that is the Lou Murphy Overpass, constructed in 1984. Now you
can understand the objections and frustrations of the area’s residents regarding the proposed route of the pipeline,
under or near this overpass.
    Before this overpass was built in 1984, there was a train crossing located at this spot. Lives were lost in a fire and
people have been passed through box cars to waiting ambulances, since the tracks were blocked by trains- thus this is
a very sensitive area for the residents.
    On July 18, 2006 Brunswick Pipeline invited area residents to an information meeting specifically to address the
concerns of the Milford/Randolph residents. At this meeting I asked Mr. Ralph Myers about an alternate route in the
case of an evacuation or an accident occurred at the Lou Murphy Overpass. Mr. Myers assured everyone in
attendance, that they had secured a signed contract for access for emergency response vehicles and personnel across
J.D. Irving’s property. This contract was signed on July 17, 2006, yet he didn’t produce this document for verification by
area residents, as he should have. This letter says nothing about the area’s residents crossing J.D. Irving’s property-
received copy of contract, approximately 10 days after the meeting.
    In case of an accident at the Lou Murphy Overpass, this alternate route across J.D. Irving’s property is less than 200
meters from the proposed route of the pipeline and there internal roadway is located directly under the Lou Murphy
Overpass.
The National Energy Board must do the job of protecting the safety and security of area residents, then merely relying
on public relations statements and rhetoric from Brunswick Pipeline and J.D. Irving officials. These companies have a
vested interest in the construction of this pipeline.
Examples where I believe Brunswick Pipeline and J.D. Irving’s officials are neglecting the safety of the residents.
    1) Question Darlene Richard C59-DR 1.15
    2) Question Darlene Richard C59-DR 1.18
    3) Question Darlene Richard C59-DR 1.26
Regarding Question (1) J.D. Irving can not provide access to its lands in the case of an emergency response, since the
emergency Measures Zone (EMZ) according to the Brunswick Pipeline is 800 meters radius from any pipeline incident-
Quote by Emera Brunswick to question (3) Darlene Richard. Now regarding Question (3) Emera Brunswick states the
pipeline to be an adequate distance away from the overpass structure. The further the pipeline is located from the
overpass, the closer the pipeline is to J.D. Irving’s entrance to his property and the internal roadway, now less than
200 meters, well within the EMZ.
Now in the case of myself and the other 85 homeowners who live north of the Kingsville Road, if there was an
accident we have no means of getting out.
Question by Darlene Richard C 59-DR 1.11. Their answer to Dawn Baldwin’s question C29-DB 1.11 is ridiculous; it
shows they have no knowledge of the area in question. I would welcome the opportunity to meet with anyone from
the NEB at anytime to take them on a tour of the area in question and show you our neighborhood with its’ unique
challenges.
No pipeline route should be given approval without having an alternate route, evacuation plan and emergency
planning in place first.
Comments about questions and answers, regarding questions posed by Darlene Richard. Question: C 59-DR 1.12.
Damage to property and property values – windows and doors can be replaced, but cracked foundations will lower
the value of any home. Homeowners should receive compensation immediately for cracked foundations, not just to
have them repaired. Crack foundations will affect the resale value of any home.
Question: C59-DR 1.7 Railway lines and storage area in Milford/Randolph area:
The question should have been, if there was a pipeline incident in this area by the Lou Murphy Overpass, could the
 numerous rail cars and tractor trailers rupture or explode, because they are located within 3 or 400 meters of the
overpass. These railway cars and tractor trailers are transporting and storing munition for the army, as well as
dangerous and hazard materials. There are 10 sets of train tracks at this location – all at this location you have the
pipeline, Lou Murphy Overpass, railway cars, tractor trailers loaded with munition and dangerous and hazardous
materials and the internal roadway that Brunswick Pipeline and J.D. Irving officials say the residents can use in the
case of an emergency, all located within 3 or 400 meters – Sounds like an accident waiting to happen.
    Question: C59-DR 1.16. When trucks are using the Lou Murphy Overpass during construction of the pipeline, will an
alternate route be open to all area residents at all times? Since the trucks will be tying up the overpass at various
times by bringing in equipment as well as the many pieces of pipe that will be 20 meter in length. Also in case any
emergency vehicles need to get through – fire trucks and ambulances.
    Question C59-DR 1.24. Shut-off valves: Since the estimated time for a technician to arrive manually to shut down a
line block valve is 30 to 45 minutes, is it possible for a technician to be permanently stationed in this area due to the
external risk, overpass, storage areas etc.
    Decisions of this magnitude should not and cannot be made by representatives of the NEB in Calgary, regarding
the proposed route. You should view it in person and determine if this is the right location for the pipeline.
    I sincerely hope that Brunswick Pipeline and the NEB will look for an alternate route. As I stated earlier I would be
more than happy to meet anyone from the NEB to discuss this issue, at any time.

I am a resident of Milford. I am opposed to the Brunswick Pipeline running through the city. As a resident and
homeowner of Milford, I have grave concerns of the impact of blasting near my home. My home is aproxamitally 150
meters from where the pipeline is proposed to run through the old incinerator property (dump). My home is set on the
rocks and the blasting may affect my foundation and crack my walls.
I also live beyond the Kingsville Road and if there was a leak that ignited at that area or beyond. I believe the
emergency personal would have no access to assist anyone beyond that point.
 My next concern is the Louis Murphy Overpass which is our only entrance/exit to the area. If there was a leak it would
be impossible to exit or enter the area for myself, other residents, but most important the emergency personal.
In closing, I hope the NEB will take into consideration the concerns of the residents of the Milford/Randolph area and
the City.
                                   Sincerely,
               Margaret Wallace

        I oppose the gas pipeline going through the city of Saint John. I am a senior citizen and living in Mildford. If this
pipeline is allowed to run through Saint John I and every other resident of Milford is going to be stranded if any sort of
problem arises along the pipeline route. If an exposion occurs we will not survive. The citizens of this great city
deserve more than to be treated like disposable garbage so that the Irvings can make even more money.
 Please take into account the amount of opposition to this proposal. I hope, as members of the NEB, you support the
citizens of this city and deny this pipeline proposal
 Thank You

    I want to add my voice to the many citizens of Saint JOhn who oppose the building of a 30" gas export pipeline
through the city. This is truly beyong belief that a corporation would even consider putting the citizens of Saint John
in harm's way in order to make another buck.            I live in Milford. We (along with the residents of Champlain Height
in East Saint John) will be placed in the greatest danger if this allowed.
     In Milford we will be cut off from the rest of the city should an explosion occur under the Lou Murphy bridge and
in Champlain Heights, if an explosion occurs inside or near the Irving refinery, the residents will definitely not survive.
   We, as citizens, are fighting this battle to save our lives and trust that the people at the NEB will see this and make
 a decison for the people and against big business.

        I live in East Saint JOhn and strongly oppose this pipeline going through the city. I have lived here for over fifty
years and have never heard of such a proposal before. My children and grand children deserve to live in a city that
they can feel safe in. It is bad enough that we have to live with pollution from the Irving pulp mills,Irving refinery,
Irving tissue and every other business. Why should our lives be in dangered further with this pipeline and the very real
possibility of an explosion.

I have two interests in this application. My first is as a 41-year citizen of Saint John who was, like many others,
outraged when a private company proposed to put a large, high-pressure natural gas pipeline through our biggest city
park because it is easy and convenient for the company and would allow it to make higher profits, when there is a
 better alternative – albeit difficult, expensive and inconvenient – the marine route, which is essentially risk- and
inconvenience-free for residents of Saint John. My second interest is as a homeowner whose house is about 75
metres from the electrical transmission lines in Emera's “preferred corridor” for the pipeline (west of Rockwood Park).
Though I have a variety of interests and am a member of a variety of organizations, I write this letter of comment in
my own right; I have no direct connection to any other submissions which may be made to you.
I attended two N.E.B. presentations in Saint John and a public information session put on by Emera and Duke Energy
(at the Millidgeville Community Centre in mid-August, 2006); I also attended some public meetings sponsored by the
“Friends of Rockwood Park”. I have read all the documentation available at these presentations, and all the Emera
application, including the appendices and the part of the May 2006 Jacques Whitford Environmental and
Socio-economic assessment: Brunswick Pipeline Project relevant to my interests.
My comments mainly concern:
     1) the public interest;
     2) a marine route for the proposed pipeline which avoids several of the problems associated with the marine route
chosen, for its own reasons, by the applicant;
     3) NAFTA;
     4) risk; and
     5) the use of deceptive language in the application.
1) the public interest
The public interest, as defined in your 2003 booklet Pipeline Regulation in Canada; a Guide for Landowners and the
Public (p. 31), cannot be invoked to save private companies from the consequences of unwise and imprudent business
decisions. In a capitalist system, risks taken justify profits made. Profits are not supposed to be guaranteed and
sometimes this voluntary assumption of risk in the search for profit results in losses, rather than profit. That is how the
system is supposed to work.
It is clear from the application (including the appendices), the Environmental and Socio-economic assessment:
Brunswick Pipeline Project, and from what Emera and Duke Energy representatives said at the public information
meeting I attended at the Millidgeville Community Centre in mid-August, 2006, that Emera signed a contract with some
part of Repsol (and, possibly, Irving Oil) to have Duke Energy build for it a large diameter pipeline to carry
high-pressure re-gasified LNG from the Canaport LNG terminal in Saint John to the U.S. border, where it will link up
with an existing pipeline, and that both Emera and Duke Energy assumed that this pipeline could be built fairly
cheaply overland, through the middle of Saint John. When strong objections were made to this overland route – and
in particular to its traversing of Rockwood Park – and strong preferences were voiced for a marine route, Emera and
Duke Energy looked at the cost of two marine routes, the difficulties which would be encountered because of sea
conditions, and the schedule that they had contracted to meet, and announced that the marine route “is not viable”.
As it is put in section 1.8.6. of the application (page 8) (and repeated on page 35 under “Findings”): “The marine
crossing of Saint John Harbour was considered thoroughly but rejected as it would not be practical due to higher
safety, technical, cost, schedule and environmental risks as compared to the preferred corridor”.
However, the Project Consulting Services Inc. Feasibility Study of a Proposed Crossing of the Outer Saint John
Harbour, Saint John, New Brunswick (appendix 3) (hereafter “PCS study”), and answers given by the Duke Energy
Project Manager to direct questions at that public information meeting in Millidgeville Community Centre in
mid-August, both stated clearly that a pipeline could be built safely following the proposed marine route (or
“corridor”); it would just be inconvenient for Emera and Duke Energy. (The two companies might lose money and
might not meet the schedule they have contracted to meet.) So from the Public Interest point of view, the marine
route* – which avoids risk to Saint John citizens – is viable, even if it causes serious problems for the companies who
have contracted to build a pipeline.
* NOTE. I should like to clarify what I mean by “marine route”. The “marine route” selected by Emera and Duke
Energy's “Team” is unsuitable. It is unclear whether or not the “Team” knew this when they selected that route (its
unsuitability should have been obvious as soon as it looked at the marine chart). The Duke Energy Project Manager
could not give reasons for this choice of the first part of the marine route when asked a direct question at a public
meeting, except that it was the shortest distance between two points – Mispec Point and Sheldon Point. This short,
straight-line route might seem defensible to those concerned primarily about pipeline length and cost per metre, but it
introduces unnecessary complications (such as crossing fishing grounds and anchorage areas) that a more sensible
 choice of route would have avoided. Hereafter this obviously unsuitable marine route will be designated “the Emera
marine route”. The Conservation Council of New Brunswick, after consultation with local fishers and others, has
proposed a suitable marine route which avoids several of the problems associated with “the Emera marine route”.
Hereafter this suitable marine route will be designated “the CCNB marine route”.
2) the marine route
Anybody interested in pipelines understands that a sub-sea route for such a large diameter pipe would cost more than
an overland route which goes mainly across “undeveloped” land. Anybody who has experience of sea conditions off
Saint John (I have kayaked there year round for years) understands that laying such a pipeline there will be
expensive, difficult and subject to undetermined weather-caused delays.
The “key difficulties the Team identified with a corridor that includes a marine crossing of the harbour” are listed on
pages 35-36 of the Emera application. They are (1) the “occupational safety risks for divers and other marine
construction workers”. The existence of these risks is undeniable but local divers who have worked in these waters
can tell you that the use of appropriate safety precautions can greatly mitigate (though not eliminate) these risks.
These are, in any case, risks voluntarily assumed by the workers involved who are well paid for assuming them; the
risks imposed on residents of Saint John by the overland route would be involuntarily assumed in order for private
companies to generate higher profits, with no benefit to the residents who are left with the risks. (2) “The bottom-lay
portion of the marine crossing and the HDD installations at the entry and exit to the water would be technically
challenging”. So it would be hard. Oh, dear! In any case, the bottom-lay portion of the marine crossing route
proposed by CCNB and the HDD installations at the entry and exit to the water on that route would probably be less
challenging than those of the Emera marine crossing route (see below). (3) “The marine corridors would intersect
marine fish habitat and shoreline habitat”. The CCNB marine route, developed in consultation with local fishers,
avoids both marine fish habitat and environmentally sensitive areas. (4) extra cost. This is undeniable, though the
extent of the extra cost associated with the CCNB marine route might be questioned. As we have no access to the
contracts signed by Emera and Duke Energy with Repsol the consequences of the extra costs are unknown. Maybe
Emera and/or Duke Energy would lose money on this contract instead of making money. As noted above, that is
called risk in the capitalist system; it has no relevance to the Canadian public interest. (5) scheduling requirements.
While the “Project Schedule” (page 22 of the application) states: “Construction and testing starts in the 4th quarter of
2007 and ends one year later, at the end of the 3rd quarter of 2008” – not enough time to build along the CCNB
marine route – we find in paragraph 3 under “Economic feasibility” (page 29) the FSA contract “commencing on a
date within the period November 1, 2008 to November 1, 2009”. So there seems to be a year's leeway. Given that the
PCS study seems to take a worst case scenario throughout, it may well be possible for Emera and Duke Energy to
construct the pipeline along the CCNB marine route within the schedule they have contracted for. If not, Repsol will
have to wait a few months before it can start to make money – an eventuality not unknown in the hydrocarbon
business.
Some further comments on specific aspects of the PCS study, AK Energy Services' August 2, 2005, Feasibility
Assessment of Horizontal Directional Drills for Duke Energy's M & N LNG # 4 Project (appendix 4; hereafter “AK
report”) and the CCNB marine route are warranted here.
(a) sea conditions.
PCS consulted with many people for its study, including those involved with the maintenance and repair of the oil
pipeline between Mispec Point and the Canaport oil buoy. PCS appears to have assumed that sea conditions for the
Emera marine route would be similar to those between Mispec Point and the Canaport oil buoy, and to have based its
assumptions about delays – and hence about costs and scheduling problems – on this assumption. But PCS did not
consult local fishers (see page 7 of the PCS study). Otherwise it might have understood that sea conditions along a
marine route which starts on the north side of Black Point (to avoid the Black Point dumping ground) and passes near
Partridge Island before turning to pass along Lorneville Head from Negro Point to Tiner Point (the CCNB marine
route), are not as severe as those between Mispec Point and the Canaport oil buoy. While I am in no position to
question PCS's technical expertise, I do question its assumption about sea conditions (and I write as a year-round
kayaker in those waters).
(b) Bringing the pipeline ashore.
As noted above, the best place for the eastern end of the pipeline to come ashore is on the north side of Black Point
(as proposed by CCNB). The best option for the western end of any marine route is to bring the pipeline ashore near
Tiner Point. Trying to bring it through the Sheldon Point rockface is self-evidently silly; a cynic might suggest that
proposing something so silly and so unnecessary was intended primarily to bring the marine route into disrepute. It is
 unnecessary because where the rock cliff ends just west of Sheldon Point, and well away from environmentally
sensitive areas, the sand of Saint's Rest Beach is backed by a clay mound behind which is an old quarry owned by a
sister company to Irving Oil, with plenty of space to locate equipment. A pipeline brought ashore here could pass
under Sand Cove Road, through an undeveloped area (owned, I believe, either by the Province of New Brunswick or
the City of Saint John), east of the sewage treatment plant and along Highway 1 either to Prince Of Wales or,
preferably, alongside the existing oil pipeline to Coleson Cove. This would provide the “open cut beach approach”
that the AK report calls for on pages 10 and 38.
     But this would still be a less desirable alternative to bringing the pipeline ashore near Tiner Point. It is not clear
from the AK report why, when it suggests an “open cut beach approach”, it does not propose a readily available one
at Maguires Cove, just west of Tiner Point. There is rumour of an intention to locate a barge wharf for gypsum at this
cove at some future date and some kind of site work has taken place there recently (I have visited the cove both by
land and by kayak within the past month), but if the gas pipeline is as safe as we are told it is, there should be no
problem of co-existence. Or the barge wharf site could be moved closer to the generating plant, or to its west. At
least we would be dealing with two industrial land uses, with no risk to the general public. Again, a cynic might
suggest that this “easy” pipeline exit point was omitted because it is “easy” and hence relatively inexpensive.
     A cynic might also wonder whether the two proposals in the AK report to run HDD#5a and HDD#6a (AK report,
pages 13, 20) through environmentally very sensitive areas were made in order to bring any marine route into
disrepute.
3) NAFTA
Although, like most Canadians, I have not read the NAFTA agreement, I have read much about it. If I have understood
correctly, Canada cannot under NAFTA reduce its hydrocarbon-based energy exports to the U.S. A. unless it reduces
its own consumption proportionately.
     The re-gasified LNG which would flow through a pipeline built from the Canaport LNG terminal to the U.S. border
would be considered Canadian product, even though the LNG is imported into Canada. James T. Jensen's Potential
Supplies available to Maritimes LNG Receipt Terminals (appendix 6) indicates that there is a broad range of potential
supplies for the LNG to be processed at the Canaport terminal for export through a pipeline.. Section 7.3.2.1.1 of the
Emera application (p. 56) gives an impressive list of current actual and potential sources under contract to Repsol or
its affiliates. However, current Canadian foreign policy and Canadian trade policy and practice, the widely shared
view around the world that the U.S.A. has become a rogue state, and the widely shared recognition that Canada and
the U.S.A. have integrated hydrocarbon-based and electrical energy systems, all together increase dramatically the
future possibility of some kind of international embargo or boycott of LNG sales to Canada. If this were to happen and
no LNG came to the Canaport terminal, obviously no re-gasified natural gas could be exported through a pipeline to
the U.S.A. Under NAFTA, most of this this reduction in exports of natural gas from Canada to the U.S.A. would have to
be made up from other Canadian sources of natural gas, and this at a time when Canada would be unlikely to have
spare capacity. This possibility should be considered and weighed in the balance when the decision is made as to
whether it is in the Canadian public interest that this or any pipeline be built to export re-gasified LNG from the
Canaport terminal to the U.S.A.
4) risk
Routing the proposed pipeline through the City of Saint John creates a risk for all the citizens of Saint John and a
greater risk for those who live in proximity to the proposed pipeline route (which includes my wife and me). This risk
is avoided if the proposed pipeline follows the CCNB marine route. Avoiding avoidable risk to Canadian citizens
should be a major factor to be considered when weighing what is in the public interest.
     The extent of the risk is not clear from the application. The February 14, 2006 Quantitative Risk Analysis of the
Proposed Brunswick Natural Gas Pipeline: Final Report by Bercha International Inc (appendix 5) (hereafter “the
Bercha analysis”) is one of the weakest parts of the application.
     (a) The descriptions and photographs provided in section 2.3 (Site characteristics) fail to mention or to show the
heavily populated areas – including Candlewood Lane where my wife and I live – near the proposed “preferred
corridor” between the western end of Rockwood Park and Pokiok. Intentionally or deliberately, a false impression is
thus created of the kind of terrain bordering on the “preferred corridor”.
     (b) I was unable to find any consideration of the possibility of sabotage in this risk analysis. Political and
geo-political developments over the past five years have significantly increased the likelihood of terrorist attacks on
targets such as LNG terminals and natural gas pipelines in North American residential areas. The number of large
energy-related plants in this area – a huge, very modern refinery; one oil-fired and one nuclear-powered electricity
generating plant – already make it attractive to potential terrorists or saboteurs because it offers them a variety of
targets. These factors needs to be quantified and added in to the risk analysis. It is also a fact, given no recognition
 in the Bercha analysis, that many people in the Saint John area believe they have reason to believe that Irving
interests have ruined their livelihoods, their lives and/or their environment. As the Emera pipeline is generally
considered to be part of the “Irving empire”, this creates another risk factor which needs to be quantified and added
in to the risk analysis. Events in other parts of the world – and indeed locally, such as recently on Grand Manan Island
– show that when people are reduced to desperate straits, they are liable to carry out desperate acts which would
otherwise be out of character. For example, it would be simple to clear the fill off a small section of the pipeline and
shoot tracer bullets into it from a safe distance; perhaps our house and our neighbours' would be incinerated in the
subsequent blow-out. None of this appears in the Bercha risk analysis.
    (c) The “Comparative Individual Risk of Fatality” chart on page 7.5 of the Bercha analysis is not applicable to the
proposal to build a pipeline across part of southern New Brunswick. We do not get tornadoes or hurricanes or floods
in the area through which it is proposed to build the pipeline. Moreover, no specific account is taken of the fact that
the proposed pipeline passes near the largest oil refinery in Canada, located in the eastern portion of the City of Saint
John, and not far from the nuclear generating plant at Point Lepreau. So the comparative figures quoted are
generalities apparently based on experience in other localities (probably in the U.S.A.), and are not valid for this area.
It should also be noted that, with the partial exception of “fires”, all the risks that are listed as being higher than that
of residents living near the proposed pipeline are due to individual human agency – people taking risks voluntarily.
We accept, for example, that we take a substantial risk if we choose to drive a car (or go out in a kayak). This type of
risk is so qualitatively different from that which would be created by the proposed pipeline – a risk imposed on us
against our will, and an avoidable risk that the CCNB marine route would eliminate – that the “Comparative Individual
Risk of Fatality” chart is worth no more than a listing that compares apples and oranges.
    (d) I could find no mention of an assessment of the risks to Saint John residents if the CCNB marine route – or the
Emera marine route – were followed, rather than the “preferred corridor”. Perhaps this is because such an analysis
would show that the risks to residents if any marine route were followed are so small as to be non-quantifiable. As a
kayaker who regularly uses the waters near and over the proposed marine routes I would be more exposed to risk
than most, but I am prepared to accept that risk as it would be voluntarily assumed – I could always kayak somewhere
else. But if the “preferred corridor” brings the pipeline near my house I have no choice about putting up with the risk
imposed on me for someone else's benefit.
    (e) There is something profoundly offensive in the notion that a risk deliberately imposed on people like my wife
and me is said, without any consultation with those concerned, to be “acceptable” to those who plan to make money
out of imposing the risk. We are the ones to decide whether the risk is acceptable to us and we have decided it is not,
whatever Bercha International Inc's opinion may be.
5) the use of deceptive language in the application
There are a number of places in the Emera application that blur the line between the Emera pipeline project and the
larger project involving the Canaport LNG terminal. This is particularly true when the case for the Emera pipeline
project being in the public interest is being made. A variety of terms might be used to describe this kind of thing,
'disingenuous' and 'deceptive' being among the politer ones.
    It begins with the very first sentence in the application, in section 1.1.1.: “The principal purpose of the Brunswick
Pipeline is to connect the Canaport Liquified Natural Gas terminal to markets in Maritimes Canada and the
Northeastern United States...”. The rest of the application (e.g., the Design Flow Chart, figure 7.1 on page 61, which
shows that all the gas will go to the U.S.) and the Duke Energy Project Manager's respnse to a direct question at the
public meeting at the Millidgeville Community Centre in mid-August, 2006, make it clear that none of the gas to flow
through the Brunswick Pipeline is intended for “Maritimes [sic] Canada” and the proposed pipeline will not “connect
the Canaport Liquified Natural Gas terminal to markets in Maritimes Canada”. So it is false to state that the “principal
purpose” of the pipeline is to do something the pipeline builders have no intention of doing. It is also deceptive to put
“Maritimes Canada” before “the North-eastern United States”, as if “Maritimes Canada” were the more important
market, when in fact it is not an intended market for this pipeline at all.
    Section 1.10.3 of the Emera application (page 10) states: “The Project will provide significant benefits to Maritimes
Canada by making available a new and diverse source of natural gas supply...” This, too, is false. On page 30, we
find that this statement applies to the larger Canaport LNG terminal project, which has already passed N.E.B. scrutiny
and is irrelevant to the Emera pipeline application. Section 1.10.3 continues: “The Brunswick Pipeline will also
promote growth of markets in Maritimes Canada, by providing additional natural gas infrastructure in the region”.
This is also false, as the existence of a dedicated pipeline carrying gas to the U.S.A. cannot promote “growth of
markets in Maritimes Canada”.
    Section 1.14.1. (page 12) again states: “The markets to be served by the Brunswick Pipeline are located in
Maritimes Canada and the North-eastern United States”, which is again false.
    Section 1.14.2. (page 13) states: “Repsol Canada, in conjunction with Irving Oil, will make available re-gasified
 LNG in Maritimes Canada to serve the existing market and to help facilitate the further development of the natural gas
market and infrastructure in the Maritimes Canada region.” This is no doubt true, but it has nothing to do with the
Emera Pipeline Project to export natural gas to the U.S.A..
    Section 1.14.3. (page 13) states: “The Brunswick Pipeline will provide welcome diversification to the Maritimes
Canada natural gas marketplace by providing access to a new source of supply”. It takes a form of mental gymnastics
unknown to me to square that sentence with the fact that the Brunswick Pipeline is intended to only take gas to the
United States.
    Section 1.14.4. (page 13) states: “Existing and future Maritimes Canada markets can be served off the Brunswick
Pipeline by using backhauls on the M & NP system or by transacting gas swaps between existing production from
SOEP and the LNG deliveries”. This may be true (though page 30 implies something different) but the Brunswick
Pipeline is not designed with this in mind and its builders have no intention of using it in this way.
    Section 7.4.1.1.1. (page 63-4) “Markets Description and Analysis – Canada” is not relevant to the Emera pipeline
project; the Canadian market will be sourced from the larger Canaport LNG terminal project. So it is deceptive to
mention it here.
    Section 7.4.1.1.3. (page 64-6) “Macro Market Information – CEA study” (and the full CEA study in appendix 7) is also
deceptive in that it again tries to imply that Atlantic Canada will be served by the Brunswick Pipeline Project, rather
than by the Canaport LNG terminal project.
    The bottom line on page 30 states: “For all of the foregoing reasons, development of the Brunswick Pipeline is in
the public interest”; but most of the items in the fairly short list preceding this statement involve the Canaport LNG
terminal, not the Brunswick Pipeline Project.
That the applicant has to use deception and false statements to support its claim that its application is in the public
interest should give the Board pause.
In fact, the only real benefit for the Canadian public interest that I could find in the whole of the Emera application are
employment during construction and: “The Project will generate ongoing expenditures in the order of $3.4 million
annually...The Project will also contribute tax revenues to various levels of government...a total of $7.3 million”.
These figures seem inflated but even if they are fairly accurate, this has to be balanced against the risk and
inconvenience to residents and the development which will not take place (the opportunity costs) because of the
pipeline, especially if it is built overland through Saint John.
So this letter of comment comes full circle and ends, as it started, with consideration of the public interest.
I have no objection to the building of the Brunswick Pipeline but I object strenuously to its being routed through the
City of Saint John, with the added risk and inconvenience to residents this involves, instead of along the CCNB marine
route, for the sole benefit of the applicants. I respectfully suggest that the N.E.B. grant the Brunswick Pipeline
application provided that the pipeline follows the CCNB marine route to Coleson Cove.

Opposition to the Brunswick Pipeline Project's proposal to build a 30" NG pipeline through Rockwood Park.
We reject this proposal to build a pipeline through one of the City of Saint John's tourist destinations. The
construction project is diametrically opposed to the work currently underway to rejuvinate the park. Rockwood
provides a natural haven for residents and guests. Greenspaces in many cities in Canada are at a premium. This
space should remain protected at all costs.
There is only one option. Build an underwater pipeline.

I am a resident of East Saint John and live very near the Irving Refinery. I object strongly to the proposed pipeline
running through the city especially the intended route through the refinery site. Having a 30" natural pipeline with
over 1400 PSI running next to large refinery stacks that flare every day, to me, is asking for an accident. If this pipeline
must exist it has to be run under the bay for the sake of all 69,000 plus residents of this city.
Sincerly

I object to the proposed gas pipeline's land route through Saint John. I live in East Saint John where we are subjected
to the dangers of refinery emissions and the real threat of an explosion. Now this same company wants to place us
further in danger by running a highly volitile gas pipeline through the same property. Please refuse such a request. It
does nothing for the city except place the residents in danger.
thank You

  I live in Red Head where the LNG facility is being built and where the LNG tankers are going to dock. Now they want
a pipeline to distribute the regasified gas. If we must put up with these huge tankers coming in with LNG then why
can't the gas go out the same way.
    Saint John is being used for this project because we are preceived as poor and needing jobs. The area may need
jobs but at what expense. My understanding is that only a handful of jobs will be the end result of this project all of
them being highly qualified positions. My inclination is that none of these jobs will go to residents of this city. That
being said what is the benefit?
  I deserve, as a citizen of Canada, to be treated with respect. I deserve to live in an area that I enjoy without the fear
of industry moving in and disrupting my quality of life.
  I implore the members of the National Energy Board to consider the people of Saint John and their collective
opposition to this project.
Thank You for your time

I have read with interest the discussion regarding the placement of the pipeline.
After looking at all the information I would like to support the Rockwood Park route. I have personally gone out to the
site and feel the addition of the pipeline and susquent cosmetic work done would enhance the park. Also, one of the
other proposed routes would have the pipeline coming close to my home.
My preferred route is the Rockwood Park route.

I live in Red Head and I disagree with a pipeline stretching from East to West through the city.
 We do not want this danger in our community. The constant blasting during construction will not only distrupt our
peaceful surroundings, it will also damage our homes. The fear of an accident when it is complete keeps most
residences of East Saint John on edge.
Please do not permit this injustice to happen to the residences of this city.

I do not want this 30" pipeline in Saint John. There has been very little attention paid to the people of East Saint John.
We have most of the pollution from heavy industry. We are the ones that will stand at our front doors and watch the
huge LNG tankers come in to canaport and we are the ones that will have to deal with a catastophy when an accident
happens with the pipeline on refinery land.
Please Stop this from happening

Good Day
 I live in the Randolph-Milford area,I am very concerned with the idea of a natural gas pipe line running under the
only access road that we have in this area.This would put this community in grave danger in the case of an accident
,and history shows accidents do happen.Iwould ask you to be very concerned with the health and safty of our
community.And do not allow this pipeline through our community. Gordon White

National Energy Board Panel Re: Emera Pipeline Project, Saint John N.B.
    When first confronted with the Emera Pipeline Co. Ltd.’s N.E.B. Application and Appendix (1-11) to construct its
“preferred” overland natural gas pipeline through Saint John from the proposed Irving regassification plant at
Canaport, the individual Saint John citizen and stakeholder or voluntary group of interested citizens who might wish
to better understand the companies design decisions and its socio-economic effects on their city will be rudely
brought up short or, at the very least be intimidated by the excruciating detail of the application and assessment and
their daunting technical length. Together they represent not so much a Caballa as a confusing road map couched as
 they are in arcane engineering expression and sometimes misleading information, which seems more like
obfuscation than illumination. Though with expert outside help they are not an impenetrable tome, but at the very
least they would intimidate or appear to be a hopeless read to the average stakeholder.
     Besides the fundamental difficulty that the individual stakeholder would have in understanding the contents of the
application, and the assessment report, one must also add as well the secrecy and delay with which they were made
available to the public at large. Though the contractual partners to the Application and their legal staffs have no
doubt adhered assiduously to the N.E.B. guidelines, where by the late months of 2005 and in the early part of 2006,
they have been able to proceed unobtrusively if not secretively to secure their positions with municipal officials and
by the effective use of nuanced propaganda put forth by the only daily newspaper outlet and major public news
testament available to the Saint John citizens and thus carefully insinuate their proposal in the public mind. This is a
unique situation that confronts the members of the N.E.B. panel. Nowhere else in Canada today does such a media
situation exist as the effete Davey Senate Committee Hearings on media combinations discovered forty years ago.
Not only does the same situation obtain today as it did then but one of the signatories to the proposed pipeline is the
same sole owner of that newspaper outlet. If the panel members of the N.E.B. board do not recognize the coercive
nature of the circumstances one must conclude deliberate myopia is at play or at the very least the intrusion of a
gentle shoulder. Personally I find it hard to believe that such pressure exists in this board’s hearing. The adherence
to the N.E.B. Act has been up to now scrupulously maintained, upheld by both the applicants and the members of the
information intervention panels provided by the N.E.B. But. And this is the rub. The adherence to the same
procedural rules is what provides an inequality. The rules to proceed dictate that the proponents and the intervener
critic must be the same. But here is where the inequality exists, in the financial and the information status of the two
camps. Multimillion-dollar business corporations and volunteer stakeholders are not equal in respect to resources and
knowledge of the process. The process and in particular the process in Saint John, New Brunswick is flawed and that
aberration weighs heavily in favour of the business corporation and its application.

I am writing in opposition of the proposed pipeline route through Saint John, NB.
I am a resident of Saint John and my home lies within 350 meters of the proposed route.
I want to clarify that I am not opposed to the pipeline, but the route being proposed.
Based on the information provided to the residents from representatives of the pipeline company, the two deciding
factors for the proposed route are costs, and scheduling (timing for completion).
 No economic feasibility has been presented or, to my knowledge, completed by an independent third party.
Today the costs for an alternative route may not be cost effective. The issue not being discussed is the forecasted
return on this pipeline over its useful life not just the economic life.
If the economic viability uses the current market value for the end product and does not include the forecasted
increases, the viability equation would change dramatically.
Fuel and energy costs have increased dramatically over the past two years with no clear end in sight.
Global demand is forecasted to continue as China and India becomes significant consumers. This will only increase
the end value of the finished product.
To say that an alternative route would end the project is threat that does not make economic sense.
The demand will continue to grow and prices will continue to increase. At some point, it will be feasible and even
profitable just as the tar sands in Alberta have.
My point is that as a resident the short term increased costs of an alternative route is a one time issue.
Today's cost and a company's schedule should not impact a community for 50 + years when an alternative is
available.
I hope that you will consider all of these issues when making the evaluation of the proposal.
Yours truly,
Donna Mazerolle

Mr. Michel Mantha
Secretary, National Energy Board
444 Seventh Ave., SW
Calgary, AB T2P 0X8
September 11, 2006
 Dear Mr. Mantha,
I am submitting this Letter of Comment regarding Emera Brunswick Pipeline Ltd.’s Brunswick Pipeline Project
(Hearing order GH-1-2006), on behalf of the Canadian Parks and Wilderness, New Brunswick Chapter.
The Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, New Brunswick Chapter (CPAWS New Brunswick) is the provincial
branch of the national non-government charitable organization, the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society. Integral
to CPAWS NB’s mission is the objective to ensure that parks and protected areas in New Brunswick are managed to
conserve the ecological integrity of the ecosystems within their boundaries. We also encourage the conservation of
our province’s biodiversity through the management of lands and waters outside protected areas in a manner that
complements the management of parks and protected areas.
One aspect of the Brunswick Pipeline Project that is of significant concern to CPAWS New Brunswick is the preferred
corridor that has been identified to go through Rockwood Park, in the City of Saint John. CPAWS does not believe
that pipeline construction, or any industrial development, is compatible with the management of parks.
The fact that the proposed Brunswick Pipeline would run beside an existing hydroelectric corridor in the park does
not avoid the principle that industrial development is not an appropriate land use in a park. When the hydro corridor
was constructed, the implications of habitat fragmentation on a natural area were not well understood, and
cumulative ecological impacts were rarely considered. CPAWS New Brunswick is concerned that the development
corridor proposed by the Brunswick Pipeline Project, by widening the existing corridor, will compound the existing
fragmentation caused by the corridor. In addition, a decision to allow the pipeline to follow the old corridor will likely
set a precedent for further widening of the corridor by future projects, even though we now understand the
implications of habitat fragmentation on a wide range of plants and animals. Rockwood Park is one of the largest
urban wildlands in North America, and further fragmentation of its ecosystems will surely compromise its value for the
wildlife that now find refuge in its habitats.
CPAWS New Brunswick believes it is important that the project proponent prove how the proposed pipeline, both
during and after construction, will not exacerbate the fragmentation caused by the existing hydro corridor, and that
cumulative ecological impacts of pipeline construction and maintenance of the right-of-way have been avoided.
CPAWS New Brunswick is very concerned that the preferred corridor runs through the southern edge of the Loch Alva
Protected Natural Area (which is called the “Loch Alva Protected Area” in the project document “Final Report Volume
1 of 2: Environmental & Socio-Economic Assessment - Brunswick Pipeline Project, Project No. 1003790, May 2006”).
Protected Natural Areas (PNAs), as legally designated by the New Brunswick Protected Natural Areas Act, have been
established to contribute to the protection of biological diversity in the Province of New Brunswick. Protected Natural
Areas permanently prohibit industrial activity, which would include the proposed pipeline.
The Loch Alva PNA protects one of the largest roadless wilderness areas in southern New Brunswick, in addition to
conserving a key drinking water supply area for the City of Saint John.
On page 326 of the above mentioned environmental assessment report, the mitigative suggestion with respect to the
Protected Natural Area is, “…there will not be a substantive loss of sensitive natural features (i.e. less than 10%) as
found in ESAs or the Loch Alva Protected Area as a result of the project.” CPAWS New Brunswick believes it is
crucial that the National Energy Board ensure there will be no loss of any natural features from the Loch Alva
Protected Natural Area, as the Protected Natural Areas Act dictates that the corridor route selection and right-of-way
avoid the PNA entirely. It is not in the best interest of the citizens of New Brunswick for any land to be developed in
the Loch Alva Protected Natural Area.
It is also very important to the goal of conserving our province’s biodiversity that corridor route selection avoid the
ESAs (Environmentally Significant Areas) in the preferred route. For those ESAs that cannot be avoided, the
proponent must ensure that the natural features are protected, both during construction and during maintenance of
the right-of-way.
Parks and protected areas are not plentiful in New Brunswick – only 3.4% of the province is located in permanently
designated parks or protected areas. Given this fact, CPAWS New Brunswick believes that the proposal to develop in
these few areas cannot over-ride the role they play in conserving the province’s natural ecosystems in perpetuity.
 CPAWS New Brunswick urges the National Energy Board to ensure that the Brunswick Pipeline avoids the Loch Alva
Protected Natural Area, Rockwood Park and the ESAs located along the preferred route.
Sincerely,
Roberta Clowater
Executive Director
Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, New Brunswick Chapter

     -----------------
         EMERA BRUNSWICK PIPELINE PROJECT
 HEARING DOCKET no. GH-1-2006
        -------------------
            Last June 19th 2006, we travelled to Saint John to attend a 225 + person meeting held by the Friends of
Rockwood Park. The Friends oppose adamantly this 1700 metre wide gas pipeline footprint which proposes to cut
through the heart of Rockwood Park and the City of Saint John. At this meeting we heard evidence, oral and written,
from Mr. Horst Sauerteig who is a retired gas pipeline engineer. The immediate destruction of Nature and Human
habitat, along with its continuing long term risks, is NOT balanced both by demonstrable public convenience and
necessity.
        Having just explained the WHO WHAT WHERE and WHEN of our solidarity to Friends of Rockwood Park, we
jointly wish to explain WHY:
1. In its 2001 Hudson Township(Quebec) decision, the Supreme Court of Canada introduced and applied into
Canadian law the international precautionary principle. Where substantive risks to Nature and Human Beings prevail
in a particular course of action, it is best to withhold its authorization. A corollary is that industrial promoters carry
the onus of proof that extant risks can be mitigated or obviated. If the current Mackenzie Gas Pipeline(MGP) hearings
are an indication of abject failure of promoters to discharge this onus of proof, then the Emera Brunswick pipeline
project should be diligently dismissed.
2. Progressive transnational corporations now structure and plan investment projects with protocols calculating
green house gas (GHG) emissions consistent with the Kyoto Climate Treaty and related Protocol. According to
Canada’s Pembina Institute(Calgary, Alta.) Canadian corporate promoters are likewise adopting these generally
accepted GHGs pre-investment calculations. Apart from effects on climate heating and transformation these GHG
emissions negatively affect the health of human and natural life located in their immediate and distant environment.
No amount of ¨¨proposed¨¨economic job creation can balance or justify these negative impacts. Conclusion: NEB,
please do dismiss diligently this project.
3. An August 2006 published article by Hilary Bain Lindsay, ¨Last Gas¨, refers to international scientific research from
the Post Carbon Institute. Other international scientists such as Dr. Paul Sears of Ottawa say the same thing: natural
gas and petroleum reserves are quickly depleting. Moreover on any given project proof of natural gas substitution for
dirtier fossil fuels must be adduced. Again judging from the ongoing MGP hearings, industrial promoters fail to
prove this substitution, or even as indicates Ian Doig with his close to 50 years’ experience in the energy field, they do
not adequately demonstrate proven reserves. This lack of transparency on the promoters’ part fails to discharge the
standard of public convenience and necessity; it therefore behooves the NEB to dismiss this application.
4. The natural gas volatility risks to all natural and human life in close and distant proximity to pipelines and
installations(i.e. blow outs and fires) seemed obvious, as explained to us by Mr. Horst Sauerteig June 19th last. If one
consults Internet reports from US Regulatory Agencies this becomes much more obvious. In Ms Bain Lindsay’s article
above, it was mentionned that US citizens wished no more to carry these devastating risks from natural gas pipeline
installations causing gas blow outs and fires. Likewise neither should Saint John and southwest New Brunswick
citizens be expected to carry these very same risks.
      Respectfully submitted EARLIER BY FAX this September 12th 2006, ( WITH A REQUEST TO BE EXCUSED FROM
MULTIPLE FILING, the efile procedure having aborted on us in due course). If efile eventually works, we will e-mail
tomorrow(13,09,06) this submission to the other four parties as required.

I am a resident of East Saint John and I wish to express my opposition to the proposed Emera pipeline project. There
is a perfectly good route ( under the bay) for this pipeline to accomplise it's purpose without endangering the general
population. This pipeline is of no benefit to the citizens of this city and therefore the request to construct should and
must be denied.

I oppose this gas pipeline through the city and Rockwood Park. I am a resident of the city and feel we, the citizens,
should have our voices heard. There are over 16,000 signatures on a petition objecting to the pipeline route.
Government must listen to the people and not just look at the economic benefits to a large corporation. These
economic benefits, by the way, will not be forth coming to the citizens of Saint John or even the municipality.
Thank you for allowing me to express my opposition

I oppose the pipeline going through Rockwood park and ideed the whole city. I enjoy spending time in the park and
feel it is an injustice to residents for commerical interests to disrupt an important feature of our city. With the amount
of pollution from heavy industry in this city, the trees are a natural cleansing that is required to allow us to breathe.
thank you

I oppose the construction of a 30" export high pressure pipeline through the city of Saint John.
  My concern is the constant infringement upon my right to a peaceful existance. The LNG facility was a done deal
before many of us had an opportunity to express our concerns. To add insult to injury our City fathers and the N.B.
Provincial government gave away any financial benefit to the city from this project. Now this same company (Irving
and repsol)and the pipeline company(Emera) propose a pipeline through our city. Enough is Enough.
There is no economic benefit to the people of this area. All we have to look forward to is the very real possibility of a
catastrophe. I live in Red Head and dread the completion of the LNG facility along with watching huge LNG tankers
coming into canaport. I am elderly and wish to spend the last years of my life in peace and quite. I do not want to
spend my years worrying how my wife and I will survive if an accident happens in the harbour, at the facility or on the
 pipeline, which by the way, all very near my home.
Please consider the residents of this great city when you make your decision.
Yours Truly
Doug Scott

 I DO NOT want a 30" high pressure pipeline to go through Saint John. The information on this project is in short
supply. You see nothing negative about it in the daily newspaper. This, of course, should not be a surprise to anyone.
 Saint John has the largest municipal park in the country. It is untouched beauty that is the envy of other cities. I
wonder out loud if the people of Halifax would allow this to happen to Point Pleasant Park or if the citizens of
Vancouver would even be approached to allow such a crime to happen to Stanley Park.
    I can not believe,in this day and age when the environment is considered an important topic, that destroying a
natural park would ever be considered.
    Besides the Park issue how can a country allow its citizens to be placed in danger for the benefit of commerce.
There is a alternative to this maddness. Please ensure that the company is denied the land route through Saint John
 and forced to spend a few extra dollars and place this pipeline where it belongs UNDER THS BAY.

 I disapprove of the notion that Saint John will host a huge high pressure gas pipeline. I have no idea how the city of
Saint John and the Province allowed this proposal to even get as far as the National Energy Board. This is an ill
conceived idea that benefits no one in this city expect the Irving corporation. Over the years this corporate citizen has
slowly but surely infringed on the rights and quality of life once enjoyed by the people.
   This should not be allowed to run through highly populated areas. If the Americans need gas so much let them
build more LNG terminals and pipelines through their cities. I realize that the Irvings could not make a profit this way,
however, that is not my concern. My concern is for the safety of my family and indeed all the citizens of Saint John.

   I strongly oppose an export gas pipeline through the city of Saint John. This line is of no financial benefit to the
city.
   We gave away any economic benefit this project might have generated when the city gave the LNG terminal a
hugh tax break for 25 years.
 Safety is far more pressing an issue to me than the so called financial benefits. There are no emergency measure in
place(the company says these will be coming, when is NEVER answered ). Our fire fighting ability is in question when
and if it is required to tackle a gas explosion, especially near or on the refinery grounds.
  I ask that the National Energy Board reject this proposal.

I oppose the gas pipeline going through Rock wood Park. I live in the north end of the city and enjoy spending time in
the park. This park was given to the citizens of Saint John and should not be sacrificed for the Irvings or the American
need for energy.
Thank You

  I oppose the large gas pipeline that is intended to go through Saint John. I live in East Saint John and feel the
danger associated with this project to too great considering the proposed corridor through the Irving refinery site. If a
leak in the line should occur near or in the refinery an explosion would devastate this community.
  If the company feels it must transport its product on a pipeline it should run under the bay. If it is NOT too dangerous
for LNG tankers I fail to see why it is too dangerous for a pipeline. The fact that a land route is cheaper for the
company to construct should not have any bearing on the decision you are being asked to make.

I do not want this pipeline in Saint John. .
 I live in Red Head where I must endure the LNG facility. This fact along is frightening enough, now they want to place
a pipeline through the city to carry this very volitile product to market in the U.S.A.
I say no and I hope my voice counts for something considering it is added to over 16,000 other Saint Johners who feel
the exact same way.
We say UNDER THE BAY OR NO WAY...

Re : National Energy Board Hearing on the Brunswick Pipeline Application
Dear Sir/Madame,
Saint John Construction Association Inc is an accredited employers organization in the province of New Brunswick
representing over 600 contractors who are signatory to union collective agreements in the building and construction
industry. As part of our longstanding mandate, the Association has been heavily involved in economic growth issues
affecting the community of Saint John, in particular, and New Brunswick in general.
 Many of the contractors which we represent, and their employees who are members of New Brunswick Building and
Construction Trades Council local union living in this community will benefit both directly and indirectly from the
construction of the Brunswick Pipeline as per the application of Emera Inc.
As we understand the application, the pipeline will transport regasified LNG from the Canaport LNG facility, when
constructed, to its market destination. If the pipeline is not built, the Canaport LNG facility will not be built. These
construction projects are valued at approximately $ 1 Billion in investment in this region. Construction employment
and the subsequent economic spin-off effects to this region are considerable.
We believe Emera Inc. and Brunswick Pipeline’s proposed route through the City of Saint John and Rockwood Park is
the optimum choice. Emera has a solid record of responsible management and high quality community involvement
and we trust their record of dealing with environmental, safety and other potential community issues will be mirrored
in this region as it has in others.
This project will further diversify the energy base of the region, complimenting the economy with a secure supply of
natural gas. I twill serve to stimulate further economic development and generate increase tax revenue for the City of
Saint John as well as the adjacent regions.
In closing, we wish to state that we believe this project will be a positive addition to the province of New Brunswick
and City of Sant John.

I am writing to object to the proposed building through the city of Saint John a pipeline to carry natural gas under
pressure to the American border.
The proposed route for the pipeline passes through highly populated neighbourhoods, Rockwood Park, and passes
near a hospital, nursing home, and many businesses. Although the probability of an explosion may not be high, the
consequences of such and explosion would be devestating.
Although I live in Quispamsis, I work on University Avenue at a nursing home. The nursing home is just far enough
away from the proposed pipeline to be vulnerable and quite possibly we would not be able to evacuate our residents
in the event of an explosion or even a major leak. The Saint John Regional Hospital is also located on University
Avenue. Access to the hospital could be compromised if an explosion were to occur within the city.
 The right of way for the pipeline plus 30 meters on either side is a large swath to run through the city. I fear this
would interfere with important upgrades to existing infrastructure, such as water and sewage lines.
I feel this pipeline does nothing for the people of people of New Brunswick. It is being built to feed the insatiable
American appetite for energy and the greed of local business. Maine residents have objected to the LNG terminal
there, yet the people of N.B. are expected to take the risk of, not only having the terminal, but also a lengthy pipeline
to provide the US with gas.
Methane (natural gas) leaking from the pipeline does not dissipate into the air. It settles on the ground where it can
collect awaiting the inevitable spark. I understand that even arcing from powerlines overhead is sufficient to ignite
the gas. Methane can seep through cracks and open windows. In sufficient quantities, accumulated gas can cause
instantaneous death to a person entering the space without the need of a spark. Methane generated by manure
cellars has been known to cause such deaths.
Rockwood Park, although a small part of the proposed pipeline, is a jewel in the city of Saint John. It was given to
the city many years ago for the express purpose of recreation for the population. I come to the city frequently to enjoy
this wonderful space. The thought of an 85-meter wide gash through it is anathema to me. It must not be allowed to
be turned into an industrial park for the benefit of large business owners who can only visualize economic growth and
fail to count environmental and human costs.
Despite my objection to the pipeline in any locality, if it must be built (and I'm not sure that it must) the underwater
route, as proposed by the Friends of Rockwood Park and the Conservation Council of New Brunswick is the preferred
route. This still leaves the considerable overland distance from Lorneville to St. Stephen. There are lives at risk
along this route - not all of them human.
I request that this application to put a gas pipeline through the city of Saint John be denied and serious consideration
be given to the pipeline proposal altogether. The risk versus benefit is far too high.
Respectfully submitted,
Phyllis Hart

I was born and brought up just a few meters from Rockwood Park. My whole life has revolved around the park, that
was given to the residents of Saint John many years ago. I know all the trails as I walk them every day summer,
winter, spring and fall to enjoy the sudden appearence of deer with their young and other various wildlife, birds and
beautiful wildflowers. It was to my horror when I learned that an American company along with a local company
were proposing to build a 30" natural gas pipeline through my backyard[ Rockwood Park]and especially learned that
the gas was for the United States and of NO benefit to this city. I feel very deeply about the park and what the effects
the construction [blasting, machinery] will have on the animal population,the trees, water and life as we know it in the
park. We need all the green space that we have in this very dirty, industrial city and I feel strongly that much will be
lost if this construction is allowed to take place. I feel that if this is allowed more will follow and the park as we know
 it will NO longer be. Please listen to the residents of this of this city who do not want the DANGER and added stress of
perhaps having to lose their homes, that they have worked a lifetime to possess and STOP this pipeline. There is an
alternative and that is "Under the Bay". Please reconsider!

To: National Energy Board,
I am opposed to the Brunswick Pipeline coming through my land and as a resident of Milford. I also question how the
emergency personal would enter into the area if there was a leak near the Lou Murphy Overpass.
The pipeline is to come on land at pleasant point. I am the owner of this land. The HDD drilling will be very loud for
an extended period of time, not to mention all the machinery. When the pipeline comes assure it will be
aproxamitally 100 feet from my home. When I bought this property, I have plans for the land. In my opinion this
pipeline should not be running through residential areas.
 Sincerely,
Stella Richard

Brunswick Pipeline Project - letter of comment
September 12, 2006
Saint John, NB
I am a Registered Nurse and my primary occupation in addition to Nursing, is assisting refugee claimants in their
settlement and claim process. I am involved and interested on matters that affect human rights.
I have several concerns with the building of the pipeline through the City of Saint John. I oppose the building of this
pipeline on several points:
- The disruption that will cause to the citizens of Saint John’s lives. Whether this pipeline is built, either, across the
 park or the city, it will cause serious disruptions on the lives of people who live alongside the route, such as noise,
damage to property from blasting, traffic closures, depreciation of their property, -for some even loss of property-etc.
I do not believe that these problems are to be imposed on people who will not benefit at all from the project. The
pipeline is being built to transport liquified natural gas to the United States. The companies involved are the only
ones who will obtain financial gains from the project.
- The pipeline poses a risk to all the people who live alongside the route and to all citizens of Saint John, as no one
can guarantee it to be free of risk of leakage, rupture or even an explosion.
In addition, if any accident was to happen, the costs both in human suffering and emergency response professionals
and materials will be left to us as citizens of Saint John.
- The company proposing to build this pipeline has closed its mind to the interests of citizens by not considering the
alternate marine route in spite of reassurances from an expert who has built and managed the Canaport terminal and
who explained the safety of a marine route. This shows that the company is set in its plans and that the rights and
concerns of the people do not matter.
- The local print media has been biased in its coverage towards the companies and has not provided balanced
information to its readers. This has prevented some people from learning the facts to be considered. This infringes
on the right of free press on issues that have serious implications on the lives of citizens. People and groups who
have spoken against the building of the pipeline trough Rockwood Park, have been ridiculed and put down by people
that the newspaper has chosen to publish only their views.
- There has not been involvement from our city leaders to measure and think over the possibility of emergency
measures that will be needed to activate if such a project goes ahead. This lack of leadership should concern your
Board as they are the ones who should be looking to protect the citizenry.
I believe that projects such as this one, should be decided by the communities that will be affected. Our community
has spoken loud with a petition that has been signed by thousands of citizens who oppose the building of the pipeline
across the park. We live in a democracy and the people who are affected are the ones to decide on these issues, not
the corporations.
The pipeline is being built by Emera. Emera is the parent company of Nova Scotia Power (NSP) and the Atlantic
Regional Solidarity Network (ARSN) has a campaign against NSP showing that their purchase of Colombian coal links
them to human rights abuses in Colombia. I am also attaching information on NSP and Colombian human rights
abuses that can be found in the Mining the Connections section of ARSN's website at: www.arsn.ca
I am also opposed to the terminal as the company who has partnered with Irving -Repsol- carries a poor human rights
record in the countries where it operates. The terminal is linked to the pipeline and the pipeline cannot operate
without it.
Repsol is a minority partner with Occidental Petroleum and Ecopetrol (Colombia's state oil company) in the Cano
Limon oil field and pipeline in the province of Arauca in Colombia. As a partner, it is obviously complicit in all the
human rights violations that have occurred to protect the operations of the oil field and pipeline, including the
massacre of civilians for which Occidental is currently defending itself in U.S. Federal Court. I have attached a copy
of the Colombia chapter in Gary Leech’s new book (Crude Interventions, The United States, Oil and the New World
(Dis)Order) that addresses these issues. Because the book focuses on the US, he only mentions Occidental, but Repsol
is a partner to everything Occidental is involved in that is mentioned in the book. Information on these human rights
abuses can be found on pages 135-137 and the section beginning on page 151 titled The Oil War in Arauca.
With all these issues of concern, I urge you to deny permission to these transnational corporations to build a pipeline
through our city.

Re: NEB Hearing on the Brunswick Pipeline application
Dear Board Members:
I am writing on behalf of the membership of the New Brunswick Building and Construction Trades Council (NBBCTC)
to express our support for the application, submitted by Emira, Inc., to build a 30” natural gas pipeline from Saint
John, NB to Maine. As you know, the proposal is to construct a land-based pipeline that will run from the Canaport
LNG terminal now under construction in East Saint John, through the city and on to Baileyville, Me.
The NBBCTC supports this application for a number of reasons. First, there are the economic spin-offs. Reports
show that the pipeline and the LNG terminal together represent new private sector investment in our region of over $1
billion. Obviously, construction of the pipeline will not only bring jobs to the region – many of which will be in the
trades represented by our Council – but will also result in other economic benefits as the people who fill those jobs
become taxpayers and consumers in the region.
The new pipeline will also ensure a long-term, secure and diverse supply of natural gas for our region, something that
will be of value not only to homeowners but also to businesses. Further economic development, both in terms of
conversion projects and new construction, is also sure to result.
Of course, the land route proposed by Emira will result in increased tax revenues for the City of Saint John, something
that is sorely needed as the municipality faces infrastructure challenges and increased demand for facilities to serve
its citizens.
Our observations have shown Emira to be a well-established, reputable business that has a solid track record of
responsible management and community involvement. We firmly believe that the company would be a positive
addition to the local community both in terms of its potential to create jobs and contribute to the economy and in
terms of its prospects as a good corporate citizen.
The City, the region’s various economic development organizations, and most businesses and citizens in the greater
Saint John area are fully behind the True Growth concept of promoting community development by balancing and
blending business and quality of life potential. We of the New Brunswick Building and Construction Trades Council are
also fully supportive of this concept and as such view the Brunswick Pipeline as a positive addition to the community.
We encourage you to do the right thing and approve construction of the pipeline in Saint John, and we thank you for
the opportunity to voice our opinion.
Sincerely,
Gary Ritchie, President
NB Building & Construction Trades Council

To: National Energy Board,
I am a resident of Milford Road and I am opposed to the proposed route to run this pipeline through the city and
residential areas.
 The pipeline will be coming on land at pleasant point and the HDD drilling is going to be 24 hours a day for a long
period of time. We as residents must tolerate the noise, machines and it seems be expected to keep our windows
closed for the duration of the HDD drilling.
 This is not acceptable for a company to have residents live indoors so they can run a pipeline that has no benefit to
the citizens. The exit point to HDD drilling will be aproxamitally 94 meters from my home. As a resident of the area I
 am well aware of the sounds that travel.
When speaking with the company, they did not mention the HDD drilling noise, the period of time it would take, the
noise levels we are expected to tolerate, or that it would be going on for 24 hours a day.
It appears that the company’s representatives have not told the residents all of the facts.
I hope that you, the NEB, will take this into consideration before allowing this pipeline through our community. I
would also like to say that we work different shifts. How will this affect our work and state of mine?
My last comment is that the company has said that any problems will be dealt with through ongoing mitigations.
Information to this point has not been accurate. What faith can we, as residents, have in the future mitigations when
we have a complaint about noise or other issues? Credibility does not exist based on past experience.
Yours Truly,
Doreen Clark
