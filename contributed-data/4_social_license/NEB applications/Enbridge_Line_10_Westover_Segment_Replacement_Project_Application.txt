 4.     The potential environmental and socio-economic effects of the Project, as required to be considered by
       the NEB’s Filing Manual, including:
           • soil handling and drainage, invasive species management, watercourse crossings, fish and fish
                habitat, wetlands, construction noise, social and cultural well-being, and municipal infrastructure
                and services; and
           • any cumulative environmental and socio-economic effects that are likely to result from the
                Project.
9.     Contingency planning for spills, accidents or malfunctions, during construction and operation of the
       Project.
10. The terms and conditions to be included in any approval the Board may issue for the Project.
Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) has a mandate to protect migratory birds as administrators
of the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994 and Migratory Bird Regulations (MBR), species at risk (SAR) as
administrators of the Species at Risk Act (SARA), water quality as administrators of the pollution prevention
provisions of the Fisheries Act, air quality and greenhouse gases as administrators of the Canadian
Environmental Protection Act, and preserve and enhance the quality of the natural environment as per the
Department of the Environment Act. Furthermore, ECCC promotes the conservation of wetlands as per The
Federal Policy on Wetland Conservation (FPWC).
With respect to Issue 4, ECCC will provide advice on potential environmental effects, including potential
cumulative environmental effects, as well as the significance of such effects of the project on migratory birds
and on terrestrial species at risk. ECCC will also provide advice on relevant mitigation measures.
ECCC’s comments would focus on potential environmental effects of the construction and installation of the
pipeline, its connections and associated facilities, infrastructure and workspace, and decommissioning of the
existing segment. Areas and affected areas where the new right of way and temporary work space will be
situated will be examined to ensure that areas of the environment of concern to ECCC are protected.
ECCC understands the proponent intends to conduct surveys for breeding birds and herptiles during the
spring and summer of 2016 and file supplemental information based on the results. As the results of these
surveys are necessary to understanding the potential for SARA listed species to be impacted by the project,
ECCC will review the supplemental information once it is filed.
ECCC would ensure that adequate mitigation is provided in order to minimize the impact on SARA listed
terrestrial species at risk.
ECCC may address the proponent’s assessment of significance of impacts on particular species.
ECCC will review the predictions of the project’s direct greenhouse gas emissions during construction and
operations phases.
With respect to Issue 9, ECCC may provide advice and information within its mandate on relevant accidents
and malfunctions.
With respect to Issue 10, ECCC may provide advice on the terms and conditions to be included in the approval
the Board may issue to the Project.

 1.     The need for the proposed Project.
4.     The potential environmental and socio-economic effects of the Project, as required to be considered by
       the NEB’s Filing Manual, including:
           • soil handling and drainage, invasive species management, watercourse crossings, fish and fish
                habitat, wetlands, construction noise, social and cultural well-being, and municipal infrastructure
                and services; and
           • any cumulative environmental and socio-economic effects that are likely to result from the
                Project.
5.     The appropriateness of the general route and land requirements for the Project, including:
           • the proposed rerouting around golf courses and residential areas, and requirements for the right
                of way and temporary workspace.
6.     The engineering design and integrity of the Project, including:
           • the pipeline’s specifications, horizontal drilling for wetland and road crossings, placement of
                remote sectionalizing valves, and
           • decommissioning of the existing pipeline segment, including the proposed technical plan,
                potential safety and environmental issues, consultation, and long-term monitoring activities.
7.     Potential impacts of the Project on Indigenous interests.
8.     Potential impacts of the Project on directly affected landowners and their land use, including:
           • soil drainage and potential for erosion, disruption of the watershed, and proximity of the water
                well(s) in relation to the right of way.
1. The construction of new or enlarged oil pipelines is contrary to the Paris global agreement on climate
change and the commitment of the Canadian government to limit global temperature increases to no more
than 1.5C.
4. Line 10 is an export pipeline that could lead to increased oil and bitumen extraction and the associated
greenhouse gas emissions, and whose product will certainly generate greenhouse gas emissions downstream
when burned imposing cumulative negative impacts on the climate, including local climates.
5. The re-route crosses the provincially-protected Greenbelt and disrupts food production as well as sensitive
natural areas. The re-route is unnecessary to the project and appears to have been chosen solely to reduce
costs to Enbridge. This does not justify damage to the Greenbelt.
6. The City of Hamilton of which I am a resident and property taxpayer seeks the removal of any portions of
Line 10 which are decommissioned.
7. As a Canadian I am party to solemn treaties and agreements with Indigenous peoples and am therefore
responsible to ensure they are appropriately consulted by the NEB (which has not happened in the past) and
that their interests are respected.
8. Food security in Hamilton is critically dependent on protection of foodlands which the project disrupts and
damages. Provision of organic produce is very limited in Hamilton and the proposed Line 10 re-route crosses
lands of an organic producer.

Re: Proposed b)pass of Southem Pines Golf Club of Enbridge Pipeline
The Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of the Diocese ofHamilton in Ontario (Owners) and
Southem Pines Golf Course (Lessee) strongly agrees with the proposal by Enbridge Pipeline to
b)pass the golf course property fior numerous environmental, flnanCial and health related
reasons.
    1. f3:r ;eePea:;Sl t4eht:eeePilP6:li,neee ,Wli!'thdgePnt, t4the aPiady,O6fhtf.euC£u:Sne: # efaPi#';:e TC:OeSge.: fi:nu:
        season t)pically runs from April 1st to November 1 st but may be longer dependent on the
        weather. All repairs would require the closure ofholes to ensure the safety of the
        Enbridge employees and our customers.
        Without all of our golfholes open our business, and our customers would suffer. The
        hole or holes would need to be closed fior the length of the repair and time necessary to
        allow the hole to become playable again. Ifa repair was needed to be made under #13 or
        1 5th green the closure of the hole would be much greater. The time to establish new turf
        from seed to make a golfgreen playable is a minimum of3 months growing season if
        conditions are perfect. Generally if seeded in August a green would be playable in June
        and if seeded in May a green would be playable in September.
    2.    The pipeline runs parallel to a pond on #13 and #6. Any repairs near these ponds would
        require the draining ofall the water. The pond at #6 is the pond Southem Pines uses to
        irrigate the golf course. A repair during the heat of the summer when irrigation is needed
        could cause injury or death of turf. Both of these ponds are home to fish, frogs and turtles
        and provide yearly breeding grounds fior families of ducks.
    3.   Southem Pines is an executive length golf course, meaning it is shorter than a regulation
        golf course. As the course is shorter many their members and customers are seniors that
        play Southem Pines because they can walk the course instead of taking a power cart.
        Their Customers not only look at golf as a game but as their source ofdaily exercise.
                        www.hamiltondiocese.com                                    (905) 528-7988
  Taking into consideration that as a golf course our property is highly maintained; has ponds and
therefiore environmentally sensitive areas along with being a great source of exercise fior
Southem Pines Customers I believe the pipeline should be decommissioned and b)pass the
property.

Hearing Order OH-001-2016 regarding Enbridge Pipelines Inc. (Enbridge) Line 10 Westover Segment Replacement (Project)
Application of 4 December 2015 (Application) Ruling No. 1 - Participation
My application for participant status for the Line 10 hearing was rejected by the Board. I wanted to provide you with further
information regarding my application in the hopes that perhaps this additional information can help influence a revisit of the
decision to exclude me.
Enbridge Line 9 changed ownership from Enbridge Pipeline Inc. to Enbridge Income Fund. I wanted to know if the ownership of
Line 10 has changed or not because the application is being processed under ownership of Enbridge Pipeline Inc. I don’t know if
that name is still applicable.
I want to know if they have a permit to connect the flow from Line 10 to Enbridge Line 9 and if it requires formal recognition of the
fact that Line 9 is now owned by Enbridge Income Funds not Enbridge Pipeline Inc. as confirmed to be by Graham White of
Enbridge via personal communications. This was validated by OMB chair Peter Watson via personal communications as well.
Those are the documents I made reference to in my application.
I have concerns with the fact Line 9 crosses wetland habitats of SARA protected Jefferson Salamanders. I have successfully
won concessions to protect this specific animal via OMB appeal PL071044. I won that appeal. All my concessions were signed
off. Currently I have two Part II orders underway specific to protection of habitat for these specific animals. One application
secured improved protections in Cambridge Ontario and the other regards area in Kitchener which is being reviewed. For many
years I have worked to secure the recovery of these species where they are located because they are indicator species of
excellent groundwater recharge areas and by protecting them we protect water supplies for generations to come. I have been
recognized for my work in amphibian advocacy in a report by Frogwatch Ontario and was the subject of several Master’s thesis
at the University of Wilfrid Laurier and the University of Waterloo for my environmental advocacy. Many consider me an expert.
I have knowledge of the geological features where Line 10 crosses because previously I successfully used the Environmental Bill
of rights to secure a Review of the State of Knowledge for the Waterloo and Paris/Galt Moraine systems. We were successful in
facilitating a system wide review of our aquifers. I’ve been successfully advocating for source water protection throughout the
Grand River Watershed for over 16 years. My expertise is applied logic based on years of speaking with bona fide Canadian and
US Geology and hydrogeology, toxicology and biology experts. It is experience based on direct application not theory. I am an
Indigenous woman. We learn by doing and from the best experts we can find.
The automated application form does reasonably provide the space to elaborate on these issues. I’ve attended the open houses
and there is no instruction given on how to fill this form successfully. No rubric to follow by example ideally a. successful
application form should reasonably facilitate a successful completion of the process. I don’t know the specifics on why application
failed. Please elaborate so I can learn what is required for the next time I apply. I tried to view the other application forms to
understand the difference but I could only access my own submission form.
The NEB did not request clarification or further information before declining my right to participate but I provide it now in good
faith in the hopes the decision could be revisited. If you require further information I’d be happy to provide.
Thank you kindly for your time.

Dear Ms. Young;
Enclosed is a copy of our ATP, I apologize that we are late in fllling this application, but this the
Dioceses first time through this process and we were unaware of the timelines and the fact that
we could submit an application.
The Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of the Diocese of Hamilton in Ontario (Owners) and
Southem Pines Golf Course (Lessee) strongly agrees with the proposal by Enbridge Pipeline to
b)pass the golf course property for numerous environmental, financial and health related
reasons.
    1. f3:y ;eePea::S, t4:ht?eee;1,P6:!ireee,W,lil,hd:=ePnt, t4i: aPiady,O6fhtF.euc£u=e:?I?efa:'£ei';:e TC:OeS;e.:fi?nu;
        season t)pically runs from April lst to November lsl but may be longer dependent on the
        weather. All repairs would require the closure of holes to ensure the safety of the
        Enbridge employees and our customers.
        Without all of our golf holes open our business, and our customers would suffer. The
        hole or holes would need to be closed for the length of the repair and time necessary to
        allow the hole to become playable again. Ifa repair was needed to be made under #13 or
         15th green the closure of the hole would be much greater. The time to establish new turf
        from seed to make a golfgreen playable is a minimum of3 months growing season if
        conditions are perfect. Generally if seeded in August a green would be playable in June
        and if seeded in May a green would be playable in September.
    2.    The pipeline runs parallel to a pond on #13 and #6. Any repairs near these ponds would
        require the draining ofall the water. The pond at #6 is the pond Southem Pines uses to
        irrigate the golf course. A repair during the heat of the summer when irrigation is needed
                      www.hamiltondiocese.com                                 (905) 528-7988
              could cause injury or death of turf. Both of these ponds are home to fish, frogs and turtles
             and provide yearly breeding grounds for families of ducks.
         3.   Southem Pines is an executive length golfcourse, meaning it is shorter than a regulation
             golf course. As the course is shorter many their members and customers are seniors that
             play Southem Pines because they can walk the course instead of taking a power cart.
             Their Customers not only look at golfas a game but as their source ofdally exercise.
    Taking into consideration that as a golf course our property is highly maintained; has ponds and
    therefore environmentally sensitive areas along with being a great source of exercise for
    Southem Pines Customers I believe the pipeline should be decommissioned and b)pass the
    property.
    Sincerely

  Attention: Sheri Young, Secretary of the Board
  Dear Ms. Young:
  RE:    City of Hamilton ("City") Letter of Comment
          Enbridge Pipelines Inc. ("Enbridge") Line 10 Westover Segment Replacement
          Project ("Project")
  The City's interest in the Project relates to how it may impact the environmental and
  financial well-being of the municipality, as well as the health, safety and well-being of its
  inhabitants.
  Please note that Enbridge has attempted to respond to the potential municipal issues of
  concern raised below in a letter dated January 18, 2016 (attached as Appendix "A"). While
  the City appreciates Enbridge's response, in an effort to ensure that all pertinent
  information respecting potential municipal concerns is put before the Board in its review of
  the Project application, and that appropriate conditions are imposed on Enbridge if the
  Project is approved, the City wishes to put forth the following issues for the Board's
  consideration below.
  Emergency Response Issues
  In relation to potential emergency response concerns regarding the Project, the Hamilton
  Fire Department has requested the following:
      • That Enbridge provide a copy of the emergency response plan specific to any
         construction and cutover activities;
      • That Enbridge provide contact information for their site commander relative to the
         cutover of the replacement line so that consultation and co-ordinated planning can
         take place;
      • Given that the diameter of the pipe is being increased for this Project, that Enbridge
         provide information relative to the installation of control valves on the replacement
         line and confirm the quantity of product that will be transported through the pipeline;
                                                                                                         1 of 4
    • That Enbridge provide adequate access points / routes to the replacement section
       of the pipeline;
   • Traffic plan - there are some critical intersections from an emergency response
       perspective that could be affected as part of the Project. Enbridge should consult
       with the Hamilton Fire Department on developing traffic plans given these concerns;
   • Emergency response equipment - given the potential for increase in levels of
       product being transported, Enbridge must ensure that the levels of emergency
       response equipment stored at the Westover site are maintained and or increased at
       adequate levels; and,
   • Financial assurance - proper allocation of financial responsibility for costs that may
       be incurred for emergency response, clean-ups and other required action, such as
       evacuation in the event of a spill, particularly costs which may be in excess of
        Enbridge's commercial liability insurance coverage limits.
Natural Heritage Issues
The rerouting of the Line 10 pipeline to the west around Copetown Woods Golf Club has
potential for environmental impacts. There are a number of natural heritage features
(Provincially Significant Wetlands, Significant Woodlands, streams, and Environmentally
Significant Areas) located on the Golf Club property and to the west of it. The Line 10 by-
pass has the potential to impact natural heritage features within the Greenbelt Plan.
Enbridge must be required to appropriately assess potential impacts to natural heritage
and adequately plan for necessary measures to eliminate or reduce any potential negative
impacts.
Sourcewater Protection Issues
Activities related to commissioning or decommissioning of a pipeline should always
consider possible impacts to surface and groundwater resources, and the establishment of
a monitoring and water quality testing program by Enbridge is essential to assess any
changes to local conditions.
The definition of "decommissioning" by Enbridge does not include the removal of the
pipeline that is programmed to be decommissioned. Considering the potential long-term
impacts of leaving portions of the decommissioned pipeline in place, including the
possibility of some residue being left in the decommissioned portion, Enbridge should be
required to remove the decommissioned portion of the pipeline, assuring that site
remediation is performed as required.
Where the pipeline crosses a vulnerable area such as open water bodies, it is requested
that Enbridge:
    • Consider drinking water source protection and therefore include appropriate design
        standards, monitoring and maintenance practices that when implemented will
        prevent a pipeline from becoming a drinking water threat;
    • Conduct inline pipeline integrity testing and visual inspections at least every three
       years;
    • Provide Conservation Authorities with the report on the findings of the integrity
       testing and visual inspections, and actions taken; and,
                                                                                       2 of 4
      • Include the mapping of vulnerable areas in spill prevention plans and spill
        contingency plans.
Corridor Management Issues
It is recommended that the City and Enbridge negotiate an agreement which sets out the
responsibilities of the parties as they relate to the crossing of Line 10 with City-owned
roadways. The agreement would need to address issues such as liability, insurance, work-
around costs, and notice. Currently, there are no existing agreements relating to these
Line 10 crossings which define the responsibilities of the parties.
From a corridor management perspective, the City remains concerned about
decommissioning portions of the Line 10 pipeline in place, and submits that more
consideration needs to be given to the impacts both in the short-term and long-term. It
should be noted that leaving a decommissioned pipeline installed in place could have
significant and long-lasting implications such as increased costs for future City capital
works projects (e.g. work-around costs). These potential impacts to the municipality need
to be sufficiently considered and Enbridge should be responsible for bearing any additional
costs incurred by the City as a result of leaving any portions of the decommissioned
pipeline in place.
All details regarding material storage, haul routes, coordination with City projects,
coordination with Forestry, Operations, and Traffic programs, and any other Project-
specific details that may arise should be provided to the City by Enbridge.
Final Route Selection
Enbridge has indicated that pipeline routing is currently at the proposal stage and that the
NEB makes a final determination on route selection through the regulatory review process.
Concern has been raised by landowners that until there is a more definitive pipeline route
selected, the Enbridge application is not complete. In addition, another landowner has
specific concerns that their Draft Plan of Subdivision may be delayed or otherwise
negatively impacted by Enbridge's proposed pipeline route. In making its assessment and
determining a final route for the pipeline, the City requests that the NEB also take into
consideration and select a route that has minimal impact on existing infrastructure and
other proposed projects.
Addressing the Issues
The City requests that the Board impose appropriate conditions on Enbridge if the Project
is approved to address the foregoing issues.
In addition to the above, if the Project is approved, the City requests that the Board require
Enbridge to obtain any applicable municipal or conservation authority approvals, including
building permits and site plans, and also require Enbridge to pay applicable fees, including
but not limited to development charge payments in undertaking any work with respect to
the Project in the City of Hamilton.
                                                                                         3 of 4
 Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned.
Sincerely,
Guy Pa

Re: Enbridge Line 10 Westover Segment Replacement Project
Enbridge welcomes the opportunity to provide further information to the City of Hamilton with respect to our
proposed Line 10 Westover Segment Replacement Project, which is now undergoing assessment by the
National Energy Board (NEB). Enbridge personnel continue to work closely with the City on this project, to
ensure issues are addressed in a timely manner. Technical staff can be available to meet with City staff,
departments and/or agencies as may be required.
This letter has been prepared specifically to address the "Potential Municipal Issues of Concern" document
presented to the Mayor and members of the General Issues Committee on Dec. 2, 2015 [Subject/Report No.
(PED15208 / LS15036) (City Wide)]. Enbridge's responses appear in BLUE beneath the respective items.
Where more detailed information is available on a given topic, we've provided website links in RED to the
relevant section within our NEB regulatory application.
"Potential Municipal Issues of Concern"
Emergency Response Issues
The Hamilton Fire Department is requesting the following in relation to potential emergency response
concerns regarding the Line 10 project:
- That Enbridge provide a copy of the emergency response plan specific to the construction and cutover
activities;
A site-specific construction emergency response plan will be developed closer to commencement of
construction, which is currently scheduled for the third quarter of 2017. Enbridge is committed to sharing this
plan with the Hamilton Fire Department (HFD) leadership.
Please note that the scope of the construction emergency response plan is focused on construction
execution. Before, during and after construction, Enbridge's emergency response activities are guided by
our Integrated Contingency Plan and Eastern Region Emergency Action Plan. The HFD has been provided
copies of the plans and is encouraged to maintain active input and recommendations for improvement as
the document as it is a living plan (evergreen document). The Eastern Region Emergency Response
Coordinator maintains a close working relationship with the Assistant Deputy Chief of the HFD.
                                                 Appendix "A"             Page 2 of 9

-That Enbridge provide contact information for their site commander relative to the cutover of the
replacement line so that consultation and coordinated planning can take place;
During the purging and cleaning of the decommissioned line and tie-in of the replacement segment,
Enbridge's Westover Area Operations Manager will be the contact person.
- Given that the diameter of the pipe is being increased for this project, the Hamilton Fire Department is
looking for Enbridge to provide information relative to the installation of control valves on the replacement
line and to confirm the quantity of product that will be transported through the pipeline;
Proposed replacement of the Westover-Terminal-to-Nanticoke-Junction segment gives Enbridge an
opportunity to enhance the operational efficiency and safety of Line 10 within the City by adding two new
remote isolation valves, bringing the total number of valves along the approximately 35-kilometre
replacement route to four. Existing valves are located at the Westover Terminal and the Nanticoke Junction;
the new valves are planned to be located on the north side of Concession Road 4 W and on the north side
of Jerseyville Road.
Remote isolation valves minimize the potential volume of oil released in the event of an incident. These
valves can be quickly activated upon detection by our Pipeline Control Centre, with full closure taking three
minutes to complete.
The proposed new valve locations were identified through Enbridge's Intelligent Valve Placement (IVP)
program, which is designed to ensure valves are placed at the right locations - identifying and protecting
every point along the pipeline where a product release could pose a potential risk to people or the
environment. Valve locations can be influenced by several factors, including topography, the presence of
water crossings and high-consequence areas (urban population centres, drinking water resources,
environmentally sensitive areas, and commercially navigable waterways). By optimizing valve locations all
along the pipeline, one valve can protect multiple water courses and/or high-consequence areas.
The primary consideration for valve placement is in greatly reducing the potential flow of oil to lower
elevations, particularly in close proximity to water crossings and high-consequence areas. Enbridge's IVP
program protects these areas by taking advantage of gravity, using high points of topography to provide
natural isolation of product between valves.
  More information on valve placement and specifications is available in Enbridge's regulatory
  application: (Engineering 7.1.3 Facility Design, specifically page 4 in the Engineering section):

QUANTITY OFPRODUCT
The Line 10 Westover Segment Replacement Project is not a capacity expansion. The project will simply
restore the average annual capacity of Line 10 to approximately 74,200 barrels per day (bbls/d) of a variety
of crude oil types. Since November 2013, Enbridge has operated Line 10 under a voluntary pressure
restriction which has reduced daily average capacity to about 63,500 bbls/d. No expansion above the 74,200
bbls/d capacity level is planned.
Actual daily capacity transported depends on the type of product carried as well as seasonal and pump
operating conditions. Enbridge customers, the shippers who use Line 10, determine the quantity, frequency
and type of crude oil delivered. Every batch of product entering the pipeline must meet quality specifications
or it is refused.
- That Enbridge provide adequate access points / routes to the replacement section of the pipeline;
Temporary roads will provide emergency access to replacement route areas during construction and
permanent roads will be built and maintained by Enbridge to ensure emergency access to the two new valve
locations. In addition, Enbridge technical personnel would be pleased to meet with the HFD to review maps
of existing emergency access points.
- Traffic plan - there are some critical intersections from an emergency response perspective that could be
affected as part of the project. The Hamilton Fire Department should be consulted on developing traffic
plans given these concerns;
Safety of the community is of paramount concern to Enbridge, before, during and after construction. A
Traffic Accommodation Plan will be developed for the project, with input from Hamilton first response
organizations, including the Fire Department and Police.
Traffic safety and mitigation measures will also include:
•      Busing of construction crews where possible
•      Moving heavy equipment during off-peak hours when necessary;
•      Pilot cars for dimensional loads;
•      Noise mitigation, dust suppression, work-zone signage; and,
•      Proactive communication with the community.

   Measures and Residual Effects of Construction and Operation of the Project on Human Occupancy
   and Resource Use (Adobe page 206 of 316 in Appendix 6.1 - ESA Part la of 10).

    ESA Part la of 10 - A4W2R0.pdf?nodeid=2883463&vernum=-2
- Emergency response equipment - given the potential for increase in levels of product being transported,
 Enbridge must ensure that the levels of emergency response equipment stored at the Westover site are
maintained and or increased at adequate levels; and,
 Enbridge owns a large cache of emergency response equipment in the Westover area and regular training
 by the Field Response Teams ensures users are proficient in equipment deployment. In addition, Enbridge
 has significant third-party resources at its disposal in the region including in Stoney Creek, through a
 contract with Quantum Murray and the Eastern Canada Response Corporation (ECRC). Other heavy
 equipment and manpower are available to Enbridge through pre-approved contractors that perform
 maintenance, integrity digs and other work on a regular basis.
 Enbridge equipment caches and those of its contractors are more than adequate to respond to any of the
 lines in the Westover Area. Enbridge's peers in the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association (CEPA), as well
 as other Enbridge business units and regions, can also be called upon. As outlined in its Integrated
                                                            Appendix "A" Page 4 of 9

Contingency Plan and Eastern Region Emergency Action Plan, Enbridge will 'over respond' in the event of a
pipeline incident.
Enbridge is an active participant in the HFD's Community Safety and Emergency Planning initiative. In
October, one of Hamilton's deputy fire chiefs was provided a tour of the Westover facility and Enbridge is in
the process of completing a requested questionnaire that will help the HFD better understand our
emergency response capabilities.
Enbridge works continuously to enhance its processes, training and capabilities to respond to any incident in
a rapid and effective manner. This includes working closely with first responders to ensure they have the
knowledge to augment their own level of response capacity in relation to a pipeline release.
This is accomplished by Enbridge emergency response exercises and drills that include externally
responders. As one example of this proactive approach, Enbddge offers an online Emergency Responder
Education Program. In 2014, the HFD participated in an Enbridge table-top exercise and control-point drill
deployment; the district fire chief also attended an Enbridge tank fire awareness training program.

Financial assurance - allocation of financial responsibility for costs that may be incurred for emergency
response, clean-ups and other required action, such as evacuation in the event of a spill, particularly costs
which may be in excess of Enbridge's commercial liability insurance coverage limits.
Enbridge is a well-capitalized corporation with a 60-year-plus history of mitigating risk exposures related to
the reliable operation of its crude oil pipelines. In the unlikely event of a release from Line 10, Enbridge
would be able to satisfy its obligations by drawing upon its substantial financial resources - those at-the-
ready or those available after a brief mobilization period.
Enbridge complies with all legislation and regulation regarding the operation of its pipelines, including those
related to damages and compensation. Under Section 75 of the NEB Act, Enbridge is responsible for
damages directly attributable to its operations, which includes compensation for costs incurred by municipal
and provincial first responders.
In June of 2016, the Pipeline Safety Act comes into force. This Act amends the National Energy Board Act
and introduces, among other measures, absolute liability for all NEB-regulated pipelines. Companies will be
liable for costs and damages irrespective of fault and are required to hold a minimum of $1 billion in financial
resources to cover potential liabilities.
Regarding insurance, Enbridge is well covered under a consolidated (umbrella) program. It reviews
operational exposures and coverage limits at least annually to confirm the adequacy and appropriateness of
coverage and limits.
EMERGENCY RESPONSE-GENERAL
For all of the Emergency Response issues listed above, Enbridge would be pleased to meet at the discretion
of the Hamilton Fire Department to discuss these issues in detail.
Natural Heritage Issues
The rerouting of the pipeline to the west around Copetown Woods Golf Club has potential for environmental
impacts. There are a number of natural heritage features (Provincially Significant Wetlands, Significant
Woodlands, streams, and Environmentally Significant Areas) on the Golf Club property and to the west of it.
The by-pass may impact natural heritage features within the Greenbelt Plan. A detailed project plan will be
required to determine what the potential impacts on natural heritage will be.
The regulatory application for the Line 10 Westover Segment Replacement Project includes an
Environmental and Socio-Economic Assessment (ESA) which contains a rigorous examination of the
                                                        Appendix "A" Page 5 of 9

environmental setting of the project, potential impacts and their magnitude, as well as recommended
mitigation measures to reduce/eliminate those impacts. The ESA reflects issues and concerns identified
through consultation and engagement with landowners, communities and municipalities including the City of
Hamilton, government and regulatory authorities, Aboriginal groups and the public.
The ESA is made up of the first 12 documents in Volume 2 of our regulatory application on the NEB website:
http://docs.neb-one.,qc.ca/fetch.asp?lan,qua.qe=E&lD=A74508 ESA Section 5 discusses the Environmental
Setting of the project while Section 6 is a comprehensive examination of potential effects and mitigation
strategies.
With respect to the detailed project plan requested, Enbridge will file an Environmental Protection Plan
(EPP) with the NEB in 2016. Currently in development, the EPP will address project-specific environmental
impacts during construction relating to a range of natural features (e.g. soils, watercourses, etc.) and the
appropriate mitigation strategies.
Please note - pipeline routing is at the proposal stage at this time. The NEB makes a final determination on
route selection through the regulatory review process. Typically, final route selection is completed towards
the end of the NEB application assessment process.
THE ONTARIO GREENBELT
The proposed project will adhere to Greenbelt Act requirements for non-agricultural activities. The Greenbelt
plan was referenced in the development of our ESA and helped inform the assessment of potential
environmental impacts and development of mitigation strategies. It is important to note that because they
are underground, pipeline developments are generally compatible with continued agricultural and other
surface land uses.
Sourcewater Protection Issues
Staff emphasize that activities related to commissioning or decommissioning of a pipeline should always
consider possible impacts to surface and groundwater resources, and that the establishment of a monitoring
and water quality testing program by Enbridge is essential to assess any changes to local conditions.
Enbridge's ESA considers potential effects to both the quality and quantity of surface and groundwater
resources during construction and in the decommissioning of the replacement pipeline segment. The effects
assessment is based on past experience, relevant land use and watershed management plans, source
protection plans and consultation with stakeholders including government agencies, Aboriginal groups and
landowners.
Enbridge's 50-plus years of experience along the right-of-way, including integrity digs and research (ESA
Section 6), indicate minimal risk related to impacting surface and groundwater quality and quantity.
Regarding planned construction activities, Enbridge will conduct groundwater monitoring in proximity to the
worksite to assess any changes to local conditions. Should there be any impact directly attributable to this
activity, Enbridge will take prompt action to remedy the situation.
 Enbridge's EPP will address specific mitigation to ensure surface water is not impacted during construction.
Appendix 2B, Section 2 (ESA Part 7) identifies the watershed management plans from each Conservation
Authority that were considered, while Sections 6 and 7 contain an assessment of potential impacts to
groundwater, watercourses and wetlands along with the mitigation strategies.
With respect to decommissioning of the segment of line that is to be replaced, the Decommissioning
 Environmental Technical Report details potential long-term environmental and socio-economic issues and
effects of decommissioning and provides mitigation strategies. Through appropriately planned segmentation
of the line to be replaced, meticulous cleaning, ongoing cathodic protection and monitoring (e.g. routine
flyovers), the risk of any leakage or groundwater contamination is negligible. Enbridge is responsible for any
of its decommissioned lines in perpetuity.
 See Appendix 3 of the Decommissioning Environmental Technical Report (ESA Part 7, pages 51/87).
                                                          Appendix "A" Page 6 of 9
                                                                                               Page 6
The definition of "decommissioning" by Enbridge does not include the removal of the pipeline that is
programmed to be decommissioned. Considering that there may be residue left in the decommissioned
pipeline, Sustainable Initiatives supports the position that Enbridge should remove the decommissioned
pipeline assuring that site remediation is performed as required.
Enbridge is proposing to decommission a segment of the Line 10 pipeline in place, as part of our NEB
application. The NEB makes a final determination on the proposed decommissioning approach through the
regulatory review process.
Enbridge's decommissioning process and ongoing monitoring, as well as NEB regulations governing
pipelines, is designed to protect against soil contamination. Soil contamination resulting from a
decommissioned pipeline is highly unlikely.as crude oil is purged from the interior of the line, which will then
be physically disconnected from our system, scraped and cleaned.
Upon completion of this process, Enbridge will continue to monitor the decommissioned line by:
• Maintaining cathodic protection (an electrical current that curbs corrosion);
• Right-of-way maintenance and monitoring;
• Depth-of-cover surveys; and,
• Maintaining signage, contact information and the line's profile for Call or Click Before You Dig programs.
Enbridge remains responsible in perpetuity for its pipeline systems, including any decommissioned
segments as well as costs related to ongoing maintenance and remediation.
Leaving the decommissioned pipeline in the ground is the safest and most environmentally sound approach
for the segment of Line 10 we propose to replace. This conclusion is supported by comprehensive technical
and environmental assessments contained in its NEB application (Appendices 6.1 Part 7, pages 51-87
"Decommissioning Environmental Technical Report" and 7.9 "Decommissioning Technical Report").
These assessments address potential risks to the environment, the public and industrial users as well as
mitigation strategies. They include a detailed literature review and a modelling of current and expected
future pipeline conditions -all of which validate decommissioning in place as the safest and most
environmentally sound approach for the Line 10 Westover Segment Replacement Project.
Line 10 is located in a right-of-way along with other pipelines. Decommissioning Line 10 in place will support
the ongoing safe operation of those other pipelines and mitigate potential issues with soil stability, slope
stabilization, settlement and compaction. It will also eliminate any additional disturbance resulting from
excavation and removal of the line.

Where the pipeline crosses a vulnerable area such as open water bodies, Hamilton Water requests that
 Enbridge:
- Considers drinking water source protection and therefore includes appropriate design standards,
monitoring and maintenance practices that when implemented will prevent a pipeline from becoming a
drinking water threat;
 During construction, potential impacts to source water are considered to be negligible. The ESA considers
 potential effects to water quality and quantity of surface and groundwater resources during construction and
 in the decommissioning of the replacement pipeline segment.
 Enbridge's EPP will address specific mitigation to ensure surface water is not impacted during construction.
 The project-specific EPP will identify all potential environmental impacts and the mitigation strategies to be
 employed. The EPP is based on details contained in the ESA as well as construction best practices.
                                                          Appendix "A" Page 7 of 9
                                                                                               Page 7
Appropriate permits related to water source protection will be obtained from regulatory bodies (Conservation
Authorities, etc.) and Enbridge will adhere to all conditions in these permits. As noted above, Enbridge will
conduct groundwater monitoring in proximity to the worksite to assess any changes to local conditions.
Should there be any impact directly attributable to this activity, Enbridge will take prompt action to remedy
the situation.
For more information, see Section 5 (Environmental Setting), Section 6 (potential effects and mitigation
strategies) and Section 6.2.3 (Water Quality and Quantity, source protection plans, identified watershed
areas and potential effects and mitigation) of the ESA. Appendix 2B, Section 2 (Part 7) identifies the
watershed management plans from each Conservation Authority that were consideredÿ
Potential environmental and socio-economic issues and effects of decommissioning are identified, along
with mitigation strategies, in the Decommissioning Environmental Technical Report..See also Appendix 3
(Part 7, pages 51/87).
With respect to water source protection during ongoing pipeline operation, preventative maintenance and
technology make incidents, particularly large events, highly unlikely. However, in the unlikely event of a
release, Enbridge would immediately activate internal and external emergency response resources to
minimize environmental impacts, including impacts to public and private water supplies. Each incident is
situation specific, and remediation methods depend on many factors such as the volume and type of product
released, the location of the release, and climatic conditions at the time of the incident. Enbridge would work
with the NEB and applicable regulators to implement a remedial plan based on the NEB Remediation
Process Guide to assess and remediate impacts to drinking water.
If drinking water sources were to be impacted in the unlikely event of a release, Enbridge would work with
the water utility and municipality to provide alternative arrangements for water, if required, and take all
necessary actions to restore drinking water supplies as soon as practicable.
- Conduct inline pipeline integrity testing and visual inspections every three years;
Enbridge plans to conduct five in-line inspections between 2016-2020 for the segment of Line 10 that runs
between the Westover Terminal and the Nanticoke Junction, using a variety of tools. Each inspection tool
performs a specific function (e.g. one for corrosion detection, one to detect cracking, etc.).
Upon completion of this aggressive program, Enbridge will have an updated data set on the condition of this
segment of the line, which will enable its Integrity engineers to reaffirm the frequency of in-line inspection
necessary to maintain the line in subsequent years. Meanwhile, visual inspections of the line are conducted
through periodic integrity digs (when tool data indicates a feature that warrants physical examination).
   For more information on Preventative Pipeline Maintenance:
   http:ÿÿwwwÿenbridÿqeÿcÿmÿÿnYÿurCÿmmunityÿPipeÿineslnYÿurCÿmmunityÿPreventatiVepipeÿinemaintenanc
   P. Pj.e, ny
 In-line and visual inspections are components of a multi-tiered approach to pipeline safety that includes
24/7/365 monitoring of operating pressure, temperature and other data. Regular 'mass balance' calculations
are used to confirm that the volumes received into the pipeline precisely match volumes delivered. Real-time
flow data is fed into computer models to double-check system performance. Other elements of Enbridge's
 multi-tiered approach include: flying the line by helicopter every two weeks, monthly valve checks, and
 routine maintenance work that takes its operators into the field on most days.
- Provide the Source Protection Department of the Conservation Authorities with the report on the findings of
the integrity testing and visual inspections, and actions taken;
 Enbridge will be pleased to discuss these findings and actions taken with the Conservation Authority as part
 of its continued commitment to consultation on the Line 10 Westover Segment Replacement Project.
 - Includes the mapping of the vulnerable area in the spill prevention plans and spill contingency plans.
                                                           Appendix "A" Page 8 of 9

All of the high consequence areas along the Westover Segment Replacement route have been mapped and
Enbridge continues to regularly review this mapping with stakeholders such as local conservation
authorities, first responders and other agencies to ensure they are as comprehensive as possible. These
maps are included in Enbridge's Incident Contingency Plan, which has been provided to HFD leadership
and Enbridge will continue the ongoing review throughout the operational lifespan of its pipelines.
Corridor Management Issues
It is recommended that the City and Enbridge negotiate an agreement which sets out the responsibilities of
the parties as they relate to the crossing of Line 10 with City-owned right-of-ways. This would be consistent
with the direction given in Report PW14073, where Council authorized the City to negotiate satisfactory
agreements with utility companies. The agreement would address issues such as liability, insurance, work-
around costs, and notice. Currently, there are no existing agreements relating to these crossings which
define the responsibilities of the parties.
As per its previous correspondence (Nov. 11,2015), Enbridge is prepared to enter into a contract with the
City, similar to the license agreement signed in November 2014 with respect to the Line 11 Westover
Replacement Project. The Line 11 agreement contained provision for Enbridge to reimburse the City for any
incremental costs incurred in executing its public works as the direct result of the pipeline.
Finalization of the proposed segment replacement route will have a direct bearing on the location and
number of road crossings associated with this project. Therefore, Enbridge is of the view that agreement
discussions should begin in the spring of 2016, once all engineering drawings are updated and
complete. Route selection is often not final until the end of the regulatory assessment process. Thus,
Enbridge anticipates discussions with the City will be ongoing throughout the route selection process and a
finalized agreement will coincide with final route selection.
Engineering Services remains concerned about decommissioning pipelines, and is of the view that more
consideration needs to be given to the impacts both in the short-term and long-term. It should be noted that
 leaving a decommissioned pipeline installed in place could have significant implications such as increased
costs for future City capital works projects (work-around costs).
 Leaving the decommissioned pipeline in the ground is the safest and most environmentally sound approach
for the segment of Line 10 we propose to replace. This conclusion is informed and supported by
comprehensive technical and environmental assessments contained in Enbridge's NEB application
 (Appendices 6.1 Part 7, pages 51-87 "Decommissioning Environmental Technical Report" and 7.9
"Decommissioning Technical Report").
These assessments address potential risks to the environment, the public and industrial users as well as
 mitigation strategies. They include a detailed literature review and a modelling of current and expected
future pipeline conditions - all of which validate decommission as the safest and most environmentally
 sound approach for the Line 10 Westover Segment Replacement Project.

     Decommissionin,q Technical Report - A4W2V7.pdf?nodeid=2883243&vernum=-2
 The segment of Line 10 that Enbridge proposes to decommission in place is expected to have a very long
 remaining life as a load-bearing structure. The NEB application discusses matters such as structural
 integrity, soil subsidence and corrosion in detail, finding that leaving the decommissioned segment of Line
 10 in the ground is safest and most environmentally sound approach.
 Line 10 is located in a right-of-way along with other pipelines. Decommissioning Line 10 in place will support
 the ongoing safe operation of those other pipelines and mitigate potential issues with soil stability, slope
 stabilization, settlement and compaction. It will also eliminate any additional disturbance that excavation and
 removal of the line would bring.
                                                        Appendix "A" Page 9 of 9

In the event that the decommissioned pipe is viewed as an impediment to future development, Enbridge will
work with the City toward a mutually agreeable solution. As noted above, Enbridge is prepared to enter into
a contract with the City, similar to the license agreement signed in November 2014 with respect to the Line
11 Westover Replacement Project.
Enbridge remains responsible in perpetuity for its pipeline systems, including any decommissioned
segments as well as costs related to ongoing maintenance and remediation.
The City will be seeking a detailed project plan that satisfactorily identifies material storage, haul routes,
coordination with City projects, coordination with Forestry, Operations, and Traffic programs, and any other
project-specific details that may arise. These details will arise once the final project plan is formalized and
understood beyond the current high level study phase.
Enbridge and its contractors will continue to meet with City staff to ensure coordination.
On November 11, 2015, Enbridge wrote a letter to City staff broadly speaking to some of the issues
identified in this Report (see Appendix "B" - Enbridge November 11, 2015 Letter). However, given that
Enbridge's formal application has not been made to the NEB and the exact route of the pipeline has not
been finalized, staff are recommending that a Letter of Comment be submitted to NEB for consideration
once the application has been made and assessed by City staff.
In conclusion, Enbridge has made every effort to ensure the information in this document is current and
relevant to its understanding of the questions raised. To the extent that further information is requested,
Enbridge project personnel would be pleased to provide additional input and welcomes an opportunity to
meet with City staff, departments and/or agencies as may be required on any of these issues.
On behalf of Enbridge, we look forward to continued dialogue with the City on the Line 10 Westover
Segment Replacement Project. Should you have any further questions on the information herein, please

RE: Hearing Order OH-001-2016 - Enbridge Pipelines Inc. ‘
Enbridge Line 10 Westover Segment Replacement =-
Environment and Climate Change Canada’s Request for Extension to August 19, i
2016 Deadline for Letter of Comment
I
I
1. In Ruling No. 1 — Participation, issued by the National Energy Board (NEB) on April 4, 2016,
Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) was granted Commenter statue in the public i
hearing for the Enbridge Line 10 Westover Segment Replacement Project (the Project). ECCC will j
be providing specialist or expert information or knowledge on environmental matters related to i
ECCC’s mandate, specifically regarding migratory birds, species at risk, wetlands, air quality and
greenhouse gases in accordance with responsibilities under the Migratory Birds Convention Act, .
1994, Species at Risk Act (SARA), the Federal Policy on Wetlands Conservation, and the Canadian '
Environmental Protection Act, respectively.
2. On February 17, 2016 the NEB released the Hearing Order for the Project, and an August 19, 2016
deadline was provided for letters of comment. I
l
3. In filing A76417-4 Enbridge, Additional Written Evidence, ESA Update, Supplemental Survey ;
Schedule Summer 2016 (ESA Update), Enbridge advised that they will conduct supplemental surveys
to update the environmental setting information associated with routing updates, in areas where land
access was previously constrained, and for select species where seasonal constraints limited past ‘
surveys. 1
4. On May 16, 2016, the NEB issued IR No. 2, in which they requested the date by which Enbridge I
intends to file the results of their outstanding 2016 supplemental surveys. In their May 30, 2016
Response to NEB IR No. 2, Enbridge indicated that they intend to file the results in an ESA 1
supplement no later than August 15, 2016. In a meeting with Enbridge staff on July 28, ECCC was
advised that the supplemental surveys will not be available until August 15, 2016. As such, it appears 1
that ECCC will only have four days to review the results of the supplemental surveys. ‘
5. On March 14, 2016 ECCC received a Notification from the NEB under subsection 79(1) of SARA I
‘ C' d3

indicating that, should the project as scoped be approved and constructed, it may affect up to 21
species listed on Schedule 1 of the SARA and/or their habitat.
6. ECCC understands that the NEB, through internal policy, applies subsection 79(1) and subsection
79(2) of SARA to decisions under 8.58 of the National Energy Board Act. Subsection 79(2) of the
SARA requires the responsible “person” or authority to identify the adverse effects of the project on
Schedule 1 listed wildlife species and their critical habitat and, if the project is carried out, ensure that
measures are taken to avoid or lessen those effects and to monitor them. The measures must be
taken in a way that is consistent with any applicable recovery strategy and action plans.
7. The NEB must meet its duties under subsection 77(1) of SARA, which states that an authorization
cannot be provided for an activity that may result in the destruction of any part of the critical habitat of
a listed species unless the responsible person or body has consulted with the competent minister for
the species, considered the impact on the species’ critical habitat, and is of the opinion that: a) all _
reasonable alternatives to the activity that would reduce the impact on the species’ critical habitat
have been considered and the best solution has been adopted; and, b) all feasible measures will be
taken to minimize the impact of the activity on the species’ critical habitat.
8. Since the scope of the proposed work does not encompass federal lands, at this time it appears that
no permits are required under sec. 73 of SARA for any works that may affect terrestrial species listed
under SARA. The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (OMNRF) would typically apply
the Provinoe’s Endangered Species Act (ESA) to projects such as this that are not on federal lands,
however, we understand based on correspondence received by the proponent that the OMNRF has
advised Enbridge that the ESA does not apply to the Project since it is federally regulated by the NEB
and therefore they will not be issuing any permits under that act to protect species at risk. '
9. According to Enbridge’s ESA, and the NEB’s SARA Notification, species at risk individuals,
residences and/or their critical habitat have the potential to be impacted by the Project. ECCC has
reviewed mapping of the Project location provided by Enbridge and determined that critical habitat is
located along the route for Eastern Whip-poor~will, American Chestnut, Jefferson Salamander, and
Red—headed Woodpecker. The project route is also within two kilometres proximity to the Dundas
Valley Southwest Forest which contains critical habitat for Aoadian Flycatcher and Hooded Warbler.
10. The supplemental surveys proposed in the ESA Update will be conducted in areas where access was
not previously granted, where surveys were not conducted at the appropriate time of year, and where
routing updates have Changed the project location. These surveys are required to complete the
characterization of the study area to determine the likelihood of the presence of species at risk or
their habitats and the potential for the Project to impact individuals, their residences, and/or their
critical habitat. The surveys planned for 2016 will include targeted surveys for species at risk and their
habitats, including bats, migratory birds, plants, reptiles and amphibians that are listed on Schedule 1 §
of SARA. The results of the 2016 supplemental surveys, in relation to species’ occurrences and
habitat presence, are therefore absolutely necessary to understand the potential for species at risk
individuals, their residences and/or critical habitat to be present and to assess impacts, mitigation,
and monitoring.
11. The information contained in the present ESA and ESA Update is not sufficient to allow ECCC to
complete a comprehensive technical review of the potential impacts on species at risk. It is expected
that the supplemental surveys will provide more detail in order to assist in the technical review. Given
that the additional information will not be available until August 15, 2016, ECCC requires additional
time to complete our review of the application, including the 2016 supplemental survey results.
ECCC will then be in a position to provide our expert advice and recommendations to the NEB in our
letter of comment.
12. In the circumstances, ECCC respectfully requests an extension of three weeks to September 9, 2016
to allow our experts the time required to review the complete Application and ESA, including the
outstanding supplemental survey results. The review is required for a better understanding of the g
Page 2 of 3

impacts on species at risk and to inform our advice and recommendations to the NEB on measures to :
avoid and/or lessen and monitor any likely effects. 1
13. As the deadline for Enbridge to file reply evidence is September 9, 2016, Enbridge would be ,
disadvantaged by a three week extension to our deadline. ECCC therefore suggests that Enbridge
. be given a comparable deadline extension to file their reply evidence in regards to our submissions. ,
14. ECCC have recently contacted staff at Enbridge to provide notice of our request for a three week
extension for our letter of comment. While formal consent for the extension was not obtained, 3
Enbridge staff indicated that our request was understandable.
15. In conclusion, given that our letter of comment will provide information to the NEB to assist in the
identification and assessment of impacts on species at risk and their habitats, and the inability to ‘
review the results of supplemental species at risk surveys in only four days, we believe that our
request for an extension to our deadline to submit a letter of comment is reasonable, and we do not
anticipate that there will be any prejudice to the parties. Given that the NEB has until May 17, 2017 to
issue its Reasons for Decision, we submit that our request should not delay the overall regulatory
process. ‘

Re: Line 10 Westover Segment Replacement Project (“Project”) Hearing Order OH-001-2016
File Number OF-Fac-Oil-E101-2015-09-02
Request for IR exemption for Louisette Lanteigne
I Board decision to amend the Hearing Order requires a notice of motion as set out in section 35 of
the National Energy Board Rules of Practice and Procedure, 1995 (SOR/95-208).
The Hearing Order sets out the process for the public hearing in relation to the Project. The
Hearing Order provides an opportunity for intervenors to ask questions in written form through
Information Requests (“IRs”) that were to be submitted to Enbridge by 16 May 2016 and also
provides an opportunity for intervenors to ask further questions through cross-examination at the
oral portion of the hearing, still to be scheduled.
I am not an intervenor in this process. I am only providing written comment that is not due until
Aug. 19th . In light of the recent Husky spill in Alberta, I did additional work to afford extra scrutiny
on Line 10 issues following concepts I didn't have prior to the Husky spill. I didn't have the same
view of the issue until after the IR deadline.
In good faith and out of a sense of grave urgency I submitted a list of questions to the Board with
the Filing A78722 on July 27 2019 which I believe warrants serious review prior to issuance of
decision regarding this line. There were previous Provincial orders and TSB orders issued
regarding Line 10 and the Westover terminal but there is a lack of public evidence to show
compliance has been fully met. I submitted my recent IR in-case these issues have been
addressed. I would not wish to assume anything one way or the other without first facilitating
proper dialogue in good faith to verify if these issues are still outstanding or not. It's not fair to
Enbridge or to this process to air concerns on speculation rather than fact but either way we need
to verify if these risks have been addressed. That is why I submitted these questions.
The concerns I listed involves critical issues. There previously a lack of permit for discharging
emissions from Westover Terminal into the air and water. The emergency alarm systems failed and
there were orders issued to install generators. There was a non-functioning emergency
communication systems between a pumping station and the Edmonton office. There are still
manual valves on that line. What evidence is there to suggest these issues have been resolved
because I cannot find it in public documents.
I understand my questions were submitted beyond the NEB date for IR submission for this hearing
but I respectfully ask if the Board can allow an exception to that rule for File A78722 because these
are critical issues to protect public safety with our without a hearing underway. I want to know if
this line is safe.
Even if responses to the concern are not allowed to be admitted into the hearing, I believe answers
are still warranted and that the Board should have consideration for the record of compliance or
non compliance demonstrated by this particular company.
Yours in good faith.

Re: Enbridge Pipelines Inc. (“Enbridge”) Enbridge Response to National Energy Board (“NEB”)
Information Request No. 3 Line 10 Westover Segment Replacement Project (“Project”) Hearing Order
OH-001-2016 File Number OF-Fac-Oil-E101-2015-09-02
I am currently preparing a letter of comment regarding Enbridge Line 10 hearing and I have the
following questions to ask of Enbridge and/or the NEB prior to submitting final comments.
1. I was reading the NEB policies for Pipeline Abandonment as seen at the NEB website here;
https://www.neb-one.gc.ca/bts/ctrg/gnnb/flngmnl/fmgdb-eng.html and I noticed the following passage
under section B.1.2.2 Letter of Credit. It states the following:
Beneficiary: The beneficiary must be identified as “Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada as
represented by the National Energy Board”
a) If a Line of Credit is written to "Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada," who or what
department has jurisdictional power to actually cash the check?
b) If royalty changes from Queen to King do we have to augment the policy to modify the gender
switch of the Monarchy?
c) In light of Canada being independent why is the check not simply made out to the Receiver General
of Canada or a Canadian based institution?
d) If a company goes bankrupt, who is responsible to maintain the line of credit? Is policy simply
abandoned or are the costs assumed by a different agency and/or taxpayers should this condition not be
met?
2. On Enbridge's website specific to the Line 10 project it states the following:
The project focuses on replacing 35 km of existing 12-inch-diameter steel pipe, installed in 1962, with
new 20-inch line. By replacing this segment of Line 10 rather than applying several preventative
maintenance digs, we will minimize overall disturbance to landowners along the right-of-way and the
environment, address ongoing maintenance requirements and make a safe pipeline even safer.
The replacement pipe will run parallel to the existing line, within the same right-of-way, for the
majority of its length. Through consultation with landowners and local authorities, we are exploring
re-routing the line in three areas (about 11.5 km in total, along new rights-of-way).
It also states:
Our regulatory application will include a detailed plan to decommission the segment of Line 10 that’s
to be replaced, leaving the pipe in the ground. A decommissioned line is one that is taken out of service
                                                                                                         1
 safely and permanently, but left in place while other pipelines in the same right-of-way continue to
operate.
Leaving this segment of pipe in place is the safest and least disruptive option at our disposal – it means
no additional disturbance from excavation and removal activities and less risk of future soil and slope
instability, settlement and compaction issues that could compromise the safety of active pipelines
sharing the right-of-way.
Here is the website where I reviewed this information: http://www.enbridge.com/Line-10-Westover-
Segment-Replacement-Project.aspx
When I first heard the term "replacement" I thought they would remove the old line and put in a new
one at the same location but this does not appear to be the case. In light of this situation I wanted to ask
the following questions:
a) How does the NEB define the use of the term "pipeline replacement"?
b) What is the difference between the terms pipeline Abandonment vs. Decommissioning or are they
the same thing policy wise?
c) Will changes proposed changes for Line 10 require compliance to the NEB's Pipeline Abandonment
policy?
3. Regarding Jefferson Salamanders
The Ontario Government approved 22 source water protection plans which took effect on July 1, 2016.
It protects a designated area around water intakes and municipal wells to prevent contamination issues
but it does not provide protection of primary recharge areas unless they fall within close proximity to
the wells and intake areas. This creates a risk because it is omitting the protection of long term water
supply. The actual source water areas feeding those rivers and wells is not being reasonably protected.
In response I have been advocating for the protection of Jefferson Salamanders using the Ontario
Municipal Board, Part II order requests and other public processes in order to protect source water,
human health and economic systems dependent on it. They are an indicator species for recharge areas.
The Jefferson salamander is currently listed as Endangered Species under the Ontario Endangered
Species Act 2007. This policy outlines specific criteria for habitat protection in section 28. They are
also listed as Threatened under the federal Species at Risk Act and designated as a Specially Protected
Amphibian under the Ontario Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act.
Jefferson Salamanders are located along the Line 10 as verified in municipal EA reports and the
Jefferson Salamander Recovery Strategy Mapping and in the terrestrial reports regarding this project.
In light of the concern, I have the following questions.
a) Has there been any critical habitat mapping for Jefferson Salamanders in regards to this project?
b) Will the permit requirement be mandated within conditions of approval?
Note: I have witnessed ponds where fish co-habitat with Jefferson Salamanders in the Cambridge
Ontario area. The pond was very grassy and the bottom of the pool hummocky enough for the two
species to thrive within the same water body. Just because a pond has fish does not rule out the
presence of Jefferson Salamanders so please secure proper surveys for these animals before finalizing
                                                                                                            2
 plans even in ponds with fish. By protecting them we protect our source water for the long term.
4. On the Enbridge website it state the following in regards to Line 10.
Leaving this segment of pipe in place is the safest and least disruptive option at our disposal – it means
no additional disturbance from excavation and removal activities and less risk of future soil and slope
instability, settlement and compaction issues that could compromise the safety of active pipelines
sharing the right-of-way. Independent engineering research demonstrates that decommissioned
pipelines have a very long life as load-bearing structures for supporting soil and surface loads.
Once disconnected from our active Line 10 pipeline system, the replaced segment will continue to be
monitored by Enbridge along with the other pipelines in the right-of-way. Landowners are not
responsible for any decommissioned Enbridge line – we are. Forever.
Source here; http://www.enbridge.com/Line-10-Westover-Segment-Replacement-Project.aspx
Here are some examples of pipeline safety issues that have already happened in the area of Line 10.
September-October 2001 — 95,000 litres of crude oil spills into a farmer’s field after a leak on
Enbridge’s Line 10 pipeline.
October 2001 — During the cleanup from the Binbrook leak, the blade of a bulldozer strikes a rock,
creating a spark that goes onto ignite some of the spilled oil. The flames were put out with a fire
extinguisher.
November 2007 — A small tractor, operated by a driver contracted by Enbridge, catches fire while
working on a tract of land that three of the company’s pipeline’s cross. The flames scorch 300 square
feet of land. No one is injured and no oil is released.
February 2012 — A backhoe accidentally strikes a TransCanada pipeline running through Hamilton,
causing a dent about 15 cm long, 14 cm wide and 6 cm deep. No gas escaped, and the pipe was
reinforced.
In light of this concern I have the following questions.
a) What policy exists to suggest Enbridge is responsible for decommissioned lines "forever"?
b) Who pays for damages from decommissioned lines if a pipeline firm goes bankrupt?
c) As of 2015 the Province of Alberta held 1.6 billion in reclamation bonds to clean up oil sands against
$21 billion in estimated clean-up costs. Alberta's auditor general raised concerns last summer that the
province wasn't holding enough on the deposit. How much does Ontario hold in reclamation bonds
currently and is it in debt or surplus currently?
d) Will liability remain for pipeline firms under common law for nuisance or hazard as a result of
abandoning pipelines?
e) If the discovery of leak takes place after decommissioning, who pays for it?
f) If property values drop due to the presence of abandoned pipelines who is liable for the lost
revenues?
g) Who pays for the loss of land use in perpetuity in areas where abandoned pipes are buried?
h) Is there active farming taking place on top of Enbridge Line 10 currently? If so how many farms?
i) If a farmer is driving fully loaded combine filled with grain and a pipe should break, that could kill a
man. What precautions are being taken to inform farmers and new land owners of the location of
abandoned pipes on their property and when a property is sold, is the risk of pipeline accidents the
liability of the previous land owner or the pipeline company?
                                                                                                           3
 j) Should an incident like flooding cause a legacy spill to well up and contaminate a neighbor’s
property, who's liable, Enbridge or the property owner?
k) The removal of the old line can help identify areas where leaks have occurred so we can facilitate
proper re-mediation strategies to protect watersheds for the long term and to protect land owners from
liability risks associated with leaks that may not have been detected without the excavation process. If
the NEB permits Enbridge to leave the line in, isn't the NEB assuming a liability risk by negating
reasonable protection for land owner's rights?
l) We already have extensive ILI data for Line 10 due to the previous Binbrook leak. This line has been
inspected by both Enbridge and the Technical Safety Board (TSB). If we excavate the physical pipe,
this can give us valuable incite on the accuracy of ILI monitoring systems and can provide data to
improve overall pipeline design and safety. The TSB and Enbridge should excavate this line together in
partnership with University of Waterloo, Federal and Provincial experts. The line is already in close
proximity to research centers specializing in these technologies. This is a great opportunity. Would
Enbridge, the NEB or the Federal government be interested in conducting such studies?
5. Omnibus Bill C-38 passed on June 13, 2012. It gave the NEB Federal jurisdiction of pipelines that
cross navigable waters. The Environmental Screening Report was converted from Canadian
Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA) to an NEB Act Environmental Assessment Report.
The NEB explains their Environmental Assessment process at this website; https://www.neb-
one.gc.ca/bts/nws/fqs/nvssssmntfq-eng.html#s7
The website of the NEB states: Some Major NEB-regulated projects trigger the CEAA 2012.
In light of this information I have the following questions.
a) What is the criteria for a National Energy Board EA report? The CEAA had policies to outline
criteria but the NEB EA information is very vague and does not mention things like source water
protection, seismic or geological risks or natural capital worth of ecological systems. It doesn't even
mention climate change risk assessments which could alter water courses. Are these issues out of
scope?
b) What criteria determines if the CEAA 2012 is applied or not and when does it happen, before or after
a hearing?
c) Will CEAA 2012 be "triggered" for the Line 10 hearing?
d) Who is responsible for making the decision regarding the use or exclusion of the CEAA 2012?
e) How does the NEB define the term "Major Water Crossing" and what criteria must it meet?
f) Does the term Major Water Crossing also apply to subsurface geological features like the Galt Paris
Moraine?
g) Should a spill occur in proximity to areas with Karst hydrological features what techniques are
typically used to recover and remove oil?
h) Is an oil spill clean up recovery of 8-10% considered a successful process? What is the criteria for a
successful spills recovery effort?
6. Ontario's Ministry of the Environment has ordered the Westover site to obtain permits for air
emissions and stormwater discharge back in July 2013. Was that ever completed? If so, when?
                                                                                                         4
 7. The NEB issued warnings about substandard EZFlow and Canadoil Asia fittings. Have any of these
been used on Enbridge Line 10, 11 or at the Westover terminal and if so, have the faulty components
been replaced? If so, when?
8. According to government documents, inspectors from the federal government inspected pipeline
terminals in Edmonton, Westover and Sarnia in 2011. Investigators discovered insufficient emergency
shut-down systems and emergency back-up power generators in the event of an accident. Were these
issues ever resolved fully? If so, when?
9. With the Binbrook leak, the control centre operator in Edmonton, Alberta, responsible for Line 10
operations did not receive programmable logical controller communications with failure alarm through
the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system, since Tonawanda had not been
configured to generate such an alarm. This created a delay. I notice the line had manual valves in a
couple of areas. Have these issues been resolved fully? If so when?
10. The original permit for Line 10 was made out to Interprovincial Pipeline Inc. Has there ever been a
formal transfer of assets done for this line in compliance with section 74 of the NEB Act? Who owns
the pipeline currently, is it Enbridge Inc.. Enbridge Pipeline Inc. or Enbridge Income Fund Ltd? I ask
this because these are separate companies by law, with separate boards of directors and I want to know
exactly who owns this pipe.
When Enbridge states they are responsible for the pipeline forever, which specific legal company are
they referring to?
Thank you kindly for your time.

    4.1 Selected Priority Program Areas & Project Examples
       DISPERSANTS IN ICE
       Need                                      Research whether dispersants will work in broken ice and identify oil types and scenarios where
                                                 dispersants may have potential. Proof of effectiveness will increase response options to spills in broken ice.
       Baseline Knowledge                        There have been some tests conducted in cold water and limited tank and basin tests in broken ice (Brown
                                                 and Goodman 1996 and ExxonMobil 2002, not published). ExxonMobil is currently developing project out

                                                 for viscous oils (2004-2005 completion of feasibility tests). The potential for dispersant effectiveness in

       Political Sensitivity                     Substantial—many jurisdictions will not consider dispersants out of fear of toxicity and related impacts.
                                                 The extension of dispersants to an ice environment should not be politically more sensitive than gaining

       Confidence                                Medium—The effectiveness of dispersants in ice depends mainly on the available turbulent mixing energy.
                                                 The energy level will determine whether it is possible to achieve permanent dispersion in the water

       Timeline                                  On the order of five years or more, starting with some form of meso-scale testing in a large cold basin
                                                 before proceeding with any full-scale field tests (Sec. 4.2)
       Cost: Order of Magnitude                  $500,000 per year
       Other Issues                              Shallow water constraints are related to concerns about suspended oil concentrations in the water column.
                                                 Fresh water layers (e.g. off-Arctic river deltas) may alter the dispersion process or require a different

OIL DEFLECTION OR REDIRECTION IN A BROKEN ICE FIELD
Need                     Separate oil and ice on the water surface to increase encounter rates for possible mechanical recovery or
                         in-situ burning in fire booms. Even very low concentrations of ice seriously affect the performance of most
                         skimmer systems through plugging and bridging. Conventional booms will quickly collect ice and subse-

                         directs oil to a collection and recovery area while moving the ice in another direction, or leaving it behind.
Baseline Knowledge       Limited—some older work with mechanical deflectors and water jets. Prop washing is a current technique
                         used to clean oil out from under wharves at the Valdez, Alaska terminal. It has also been tried in Cook

                         A series of projects are planned to further develop this concept in 2004 and 2005.
Political Sensitivity    None—mechanical recovery methods are accepted in all jurisdictions.
Confidence               Medium—Major constraint centers on the difficulty of moving oil a significant distance (beyond 20 to 30 meters).
Timeline                 2-5 years
Cost: Order of Magnitude $250,000 for Phase 1. Total program cost could reach $500,000 to $1 million.
Other Issues             Could also have applications for improved containment and recovery in non-ice areas such as rivers and
                         streams. There is a diversity of projects to be considered. The ability of modern icebreakers to influence the
                         surrounding ice over distances several times the vessel's beam may have applications to this program. Fig. 12.

       REMOTE SENSING OF OIL UNDER, IN, AMONG OR ON TOP OF ICE
       Need                                      It is essential to know where the oil is in order to plan a response. Urgent need is to be able to detect and
                                                 locate, map the contamination boundaries, and track and monitor oil trapped with ice. Fig. 1 (page 6).
       Baseline Knowledge                        Substantial—Some success has been achieved in the past with acoustic technologies (Fingas and Brown
                                                 2002). Numerous projects have examined all possible technologies, but none has led to an operational
                                                 system. Minerals Management Service (MMS) technology review covers experiences of past work (Dickins
                                                 2001). Recent progress includes testing a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GCMS) for vapor extrac-
                                                 tions through ice in Alaska; and applying infra-red optical beam technologies to detect very low vapor
                                                 concentrations, for example across a river (Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., unpublished). Current technology
                                                 involves drilling large numbers of boreholes through the ice in a closely spaced pattern to uncover the
                                                 presence of oil. Norwegian Clean Seas Association for Operating Companies (NOFO) has an ongoing
                                                 program looking at advancing capabilities to detect oil for spill response in darkness. There are numerous
                                                 examples where satellite imagery has been used to map oil slicks at sea, and radar satellites are routinely
                                                 used to identify and map different ice types. However, the capabilities of space borne sensors to discriminate
                                                 between oiled and clean ice, or to detect oil on relatively calm water between ice floes have not been investigated.

       Confidence                                Low for aerial systems, increasing to medium for ground-based.
       Timeline                                  2 years to demonstrate effectiveness of recent advances
       Cost: Order of Magnitude                  $100,000 per year to investigate ground-based systems. Aerial system development would be order(s) of
                                                 magnitude more expensive with low chance of success.

TRANSFERRING VISCOUS PRODUCTS WITH ICE
Need                     Extend recent work on viscous oil pumping to understand the effect of ice pieces. Serious impact of slush
                         and small ice chunks on ability to pump cold oily waste is a major problem.
Baseline Knowledge       Several recent projects by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and Alaska Clean Seas (ACS) have focused on the
                         problem of transferring cold oil products, including emulsions. There is no baseline knowledge in under
                         standing how to pump oil and ice mixtures.
Political Sensitivity    None
Confidence               High
Timeline                 1-2 years
Cost: Order of Magnitude $100,000-$200,000
Other Issues
Example Projects         •    Processing viscous emulsions with small ice chunks. Integrated study encompassing all processing
                              phases (collection, pumping, storage, offloading)
CHEMICAL HERDERS
Need                     Thicken slicks among broken ice floes so that the oil can be ignited and burned effectively. Equilibrium
                         thickness of crude oil on cold water may not be sufficient to allow efficient in-situ burning in a natural state.
Baseline Knowledge       Some data for spills on open water. No data on behavior of herders in an ice environment. Initial lab-scale
                         tests being carried out by ExxonMobil 2003.
Political Sensitivity    Reluctance to introduce another chemical into the environment may affect approvals, although herders
                         typically have low toxicity and do not result in dispersion of oil into the water column.
Confidence               Moderate
Timeline                 1 year for first phase
Cost: Order of Magnitude $150,000 to fund full meso-scale program (cold basin) leading to possible future incorporation into field
                         trials (Sec. 4.2)
Other Issues             The utility of chemical herders will depend upon approvals to conduct in-situ burning of the oil slick.
Example Projects         •    Validate chemical herding action in ice. Primary purpose is to enhance in-situ burning by thickening oil.

      ENHANCE CAPABILITIES OF EXISTING MECHANICAL RECOVERY SYSTEMS
      Need                                     Expand the operational capability of existing spill response equipment to enable oil recovery in ice.
                                               Examples: Fig. 10 (page 7)
      Baseline Knowledge                       Considerable background of testing different skimmer systems (oleophilic, brush, pumps, disks, weir) in
                                               ice, in tank tests, and full-scale applications. No recent attempts to optimize devices in freezing conditions
                                               with ice present.
      Political Sensitivity                    None. Mechanical systems are universally accepted.
      Confidence                               Low—improvements likely to be incremental, resulting in modest increase in recovery effectiveness.
                                               Critical problem with application of mechanical systems to deal with oil in ice is the low encounter rate
                                               (combination of small swath width and low speed of advance).
      Timeline                                 1-2 years
      Cost: Order of Magnitude                 Not estimated
      Other Issues                             Need to employ standardized testing techniques to ensure that all parties, including citizens’ advisory
                                               councils and regulatory agencies, accept comparative test results.
      Example Projects                         •      Research to expand operating window for mechanical recovery with ice present could be linked to
                                                      projects in oil deflection and herding, and may employ some aspect of ice management with support

      SIMULANTS
      Need                                     Develop environmentally acceptable, surrogate oil for experiments and responder training in a realistic at-sea
                                               environment. Motivation is derived from inability to obtain permits to conduct field trials in U.S. waters
                                               with real oil.
      Baseline Knowledge                       Substantial previous efforts to identify a surrogate product, which mimics oil and poses no threat to the
                                               environment. Historical trials have included the use of oranges, popcorn, Hula Hoops and canola oil.
                                               Recent work at the University of Utah has led to some progress with an aerated, biological oil product,
                                               but the issue of stickiness remains unresolved.
      Political Sensitivity                    Significant—related to concerns about toxicity, solubility in water, and the impact on wildlife from stickiness.
      Confidence                               Low—improvements are likely to be incremental, resulting in a modest increase in recovery effectiveness.

      Cost: Order of Magnitude                 Typical annual costs approximately $50,000 per year.
      Other Issues                             Potential for patents could interfere with joint funding.
      Example Projects                         •      Develop surrogate oil, which is environmentally acceptable (low-toxicity, non-sticky, rapidly broken

Major quake could pose systemic risk to Canada's financial sector, report says
Beyond $30B in claims, 'catastrophic losses would exceed the existing capacity' of the insurance industry
CBC News Posted: Aug 03, 2016 10:48 AM ET Last Updated: Aug 03, 2016 10:49 AM ET
A major earthquake could pose a serious risk to Canada's economy, says a new report from the C.D.
Howe Institute that calls for action to bolster the financial system so it could better handle the aftermath
of such a disaster.
Canada's property and casualty insurers could handle claims totalling up to $30 billion, says the report's
author, Nick Le Pan. Beyond that, "the catastrophic losses would exceed the existing capacity of
Canada's insurance industry," Le Pan says.
     Catastrophic earthquake: B.C. not prepared, says report
     Cascadia Rising doomsday earthquake drill to include U.S., B.C.
One or more national insurers would fail, he says. Even with lower insured losses — in the $25 billion to
$30 billion range — several smaller companies would fail.
Le Pan, a former federal superintendent of financial institutions, urges banks and credit unions to carry
out stress tests to account for the fallout to insurers from natural disasters, pointing out that mortgage
insurance does not cover earthquake losses and many mortgages lack quake coverage.
30% chance
By some estimates, there is a 30 per cent chance that British Columbia could be hit with a significant
quake in the next 50 years. A magnitude 9.0 quake off the coast of Vancouver could lead to $75 billion in
losses, with about $20 billion of that insured, according to industry figures.
But one analysis suggested that a catastrophic West Coast quake could lead to insurance claims of up
to $95 billion — far above the ability of the industry and its compensation organization to cover.
Almost two­thirds of southwest B.C. homeowners have earthquake insurance, the report notes, while
coverage by renters is much more sporadic.
But B.C. is not Canada's only quake zone.
In the Quebec­Ottawa­Montreal corridor, for instance, Natural Resources Canada estimates a 10 to 15
per cent chance of a major earthquake. A magnitude 7.1 quake in the St. Lawrence Valley between
Montreal and Quebec City could lead to $60 billion in damage, with insured losses of $12 billion. Only
two per cent of homeowners in this area have earthquake insurance.
     How earthquake­proof is Montreal? Not very, says expert
Currently, there is no federal emergency backstop arrangement for property and casualty insurance
companies that would be triggered beyond a certain loss level. Such guarantees already exist in the
banking industry, for instance.
Risk awareness
 Risk awareness
The industry­funded Property and Casualty Insurance Compensation Corporation (PACICC), which
covers claims when an insolvent member company can't make payments to policyholders, should be
strengthened, the report argues.
"PACICC has effectively handled individual company failures in the past, but would need to enhance its
emergency response capacity for such a catastrophe, as it has never dealt with multiple members in
financial difficulty at the same time," it says.
The report also says governments and the industry need to make people more aware of
earthquake risks and encourage them to consider disaster insurance coverage, especially in the Quebec
City­Montreal­Ottawa corridor where it says coverage is far too low.
"Having appropriate prevention, insurance and coping mechanisms in place in advance reduces the
short­term macroeconomic impact of disasters and increases the chance that growth potential is not
permanently impaired," the report says.

1.0       PROJECT OVERVIEW
          On January 17, 2014, Enbridge Pipelines Inc. (Enbridge) applied to the National
          Energy Board (NEB or the Board) pursuant to Section 58 of the National Energy
          Board Act, (the Act) for approval to construct and operate a new pipeline (the Line 11
          Westover Segment Replacement or the Project) and Section 45.1 of the National
          Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations (OPR), for approval to decommission
          the replaced segment of the existing Enbridge Line 11 pipeline.
          Enbridge currently operates the existing Line 11 pipeline which originates at the
          Enbridge Westover Terminal and transports crude oil southeast to the Nanticoke
          refinery, in Nanticoke, Ontario. The segment of the Line 11 pipeline being replaced is
          approximately 2.89 km long and was constructed in 1971.
          As per approval received from the Board, NEB Order XO-E101-016-2014 required
          Enbridge to apply for Leave to Open for the applied for replacement section of pipe. In
          order to minimize any disruption in service, it is imperative for Enbridge to complete
          equipment installation and start-up activities during planned outages. Therefore,
          Enbridge respectfully requests that the Board approve this Leave to Open application
          by February 13, 2015, in order to make the necessary arrangements to tie in the new
          section of pipeline during the planned outage scheduled for February 23, 2015.
          Guide T from the NEB Filing Manual is included as Attachment No. 1.
1.1       Project Scope of Work
          This Project was undertaken as part of Enbridge’s ongoing pipeline integrity
          management and maintenance program. In line inspection of Line 11 detected a
          number of integrity features which required attention. Enbridge determined that
          replacement of the segment was the most effective and economic maintenance
          method in relation to this segment of Line 11.
          The Project replaces the segment of pipeline from the Westover Terminal at LOT 29,
          Concession 5 in the Township of Beverly, in City of Hamilton to a tie-in point within
          LOT 29, Concession 4 in the Township of Beverly, in the City of Hamilton. The Line 11
          Replacement 508 mm O.D. (NPS 20) pipeline will transport crude oil and is
          approximately 2.89 km in length.
          The replacement pipe was then hydrotested on site as described in this application
          and associated drawings.
          Radiographic examination and hydrostatic tests were completed on all piping sections.
          Additionally, welds were visually and nondestructively inspected in accordance with
          CSA Z662. Enbridge confirms that the entire circumference of each weld joint also

         Water for the HDB and Security Pipe Hydrostatic Test (#1) was sourced Bright Water
         Services (commercial supplier) and for both the Mainline Hydrostatic Test (#2) and Tie-In
         Sections Hydrostatic Test (#3) was sourced from the St-George drinking water system
         (County of Brant) for these hydrotests so consequently no permits were required to
         source this water.
         Following completion of the hydrotest, all test water was disposed with the City of
         Hamilton in accordance to city regulation and approval.

Enbridge Income Fund Completes Acquisition of Canadian Liquids Pipelines Business
and Renewable Energy Assets; Enbridge Income Fund Holdings Inc. Increases
Monthly Dividend
September 1, 2015 ­ 17:15 ET
CALGARY, ALBERTA­­(Marketwired ­ Sept. 1, 2015) ­ Enbridge Income Fund Holdings Inc. (the "Company")
(TSX:ENF) and Enbridge Income Fund (the "Fund") announced the closing of the acquisition of Enbridge Inc.'s (TSX:ENB)
(NYSE:ENB) Canadian Liquids Pipelines business, comprised of Enbridge Pipelines Inc. (EPI) and Enbridge Pipelines
Athabasca Inc. (EPA), and certain Canadian renewable energy assets (the "Transaction") by an indirect subsidiary of
Enbridge Income Fund (the "Fund") for $30.4 billion plus incentive/performance rights.
The Company's Board of Directors declared a dividend payable on October 15, 2015 to shareholders of record at
September 30, 2015 in the sum of $0.1414 per common share of the Company (Common Share), representing a 10
percent increase to $1.6968 per Common Share annualized. The dividend is designated an eligible dividend for Canadian
tax purposes which qualifies for the enhanced dividend tax credit. A further 10 percent increase is expected at the
beginning of 2016 and each year thereafter through 2019.
The Transaction was overwhelmingly approved by the Company's shareholders at a special meeting held on August 20,
2015 and provides a highly transparent source of long­term growth based on $15 billion of low­risk, commercially secured
growth projects associated with the acquired assets; $3 billion of which are already in­service and the balance of which
are expected to come into service by 2018.
"We are very pleased to have closed this Transaction," said Company President Perry Schuldhaus. "It represents a very
substantial increase in the scale and scope of the Fund's business and transforms the Company into a premier energy
infrastructure investment vehicle, providing shareholders with premium dividend growth generated from a diversified
portfolio of infrastructure assets with low risk commercial characteristics."
Details of the Transaction, including a description of the assets, the terms of the sale, including the consideration paid and
the securities issued to Enbridge Inc. and its affiliates are set out in the June 19, 2015 joint news release of the Company
and the Fund.
FORWARD­LOOKING INFORMATION
Forward­looking information, or forward­looking statements, have been included in this news release to provide information
about the Company and the Fund, including statements with respect to: expectations regarding, and anticipated impact of,
the Transaction; near and long term growth of the Fund; dividend expectations; and value to shareholders of the Company.
Although the Company and the Fund believe these forward­looking statements are reasonable based on the information
available on the date such statements are made and processes used to prepare the information, such statements are not
guarantees of future performance and readers are cautioned against placing undue reliance on forward­looking statements.
 By their nature, these statements involve a variety of assumptions, known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other
factors, which may cause actual results, levels of activity and achievements to differ materially from those expressed or
implied by such statements. Material assumptions include assumptions about: expected timing and terms of the
Transaction; anticipated completion of the Transaction; satisfaction of all closing conditions and receipt of consents and
approvals with respect to the Transaction; impact of the Transaction and dividend expectations; expected supply and
demand for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids; prices of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids; expected
exchange rates; inflation; interest rates; completion of growth projects, availability and price of labour and pipeline
construction materials; operational reliability; anticipated in­service dates and weather. Assumptions regarding the
expected supply of and demand of crude oil, natural gas, NGL and renewable energy, and the prices of these
commodities, are material to and underlie all forward­looking statements. These factors are relevant to all forward­looking
statements as they may impact current and future levels of demand for the Fund's services and products. Similarly,
exchange rates, inflation and interest rates impact the economies and business environments in which the Fund operates
and may impact levels of demand for the Fund's services and cost of inputs, and are therefore inherent in all forward­
looking statements. Due to the interdependencies and correlation of these macroeconomic factors, the impact of any one
assumption on a forward­looking statement cannot be determined with certainty.
The Company's and the Fund's forward­looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties pertaining to the
Transaction, dividend expectations, operating performance, regulatory parameters, project approval and support, weather,
economic and competitive conditions, changes in tax law and tax rates, exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices
and supply and demand for commodities, including but not limited to those risks and uncertainties discussed in this news
release and in the Company's and the Fund's other filings with Canadian securities regulators. The impact of any one risk,
uncertainty or factor on a particular forward­looking statement is not determinable with certainty as these are
interdependent and the Company's and the Fund's future course of action depends on management's assessment of all
information available at the relevant time. Except to the extent required by applicable law, the Company and the Fund
assume no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward­looking statements made in this news release or otherwise,
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All subsequent forward­looking statements, whether
written or oral, attributable to the Company, the Fund, or persons acting on their behalf, are expressly qualified in their
entirety by these cautionary statements.
Readers should be cautioned that there is no assurance that the Transaction will be completed in the manner
contemplated, or at all, or that the current market conditions and the assumptions and forecasts based on such market
conditions will not materially change.

Dear Ms. Lanteigne,
Re:    Enbridge Pipelines Inc. (Enbridge)
       Line 10 Westover Segment Replacement Project (Line 10)
The National Energy Board (NEB or Board) acknowledges receipt of your questions submitted
to Matt Groza on 27 and 28 April 2016 regarding the ownership structure for Line 10. As your
questions extend beyond the scope of process support that the NEB’s Process Advisors can
provide, the Board offers the following responses.
    •  You have requested a copy of the existing Certificate for Line 10.
           o This has been provided to you already.
    •  You have requested a copy of transfer of assets specific to Line 10, and raised several
       concerns regarding ownership related to Enbridge Income Fund and Enbridge Pipelines
       Inc. You have stated that ‘…if the ownership of the line has changed it is reasonable to
       state the current application is with a firm that no longer owns the pipe and this hearing
       process is null and void. That is the issue I want clarity on.”
           o The certificate holder for Line 10 is Enbridge Pipelines Inc. The existing
               certificate authorizes the operation of the pipeline. The replacement of Line 10 is
               subject to Board approval.
           o The applicant for the Line 10 Westover Segment Replacement Project is Enbridge
               Pipeline Inc. The applicant refers to itself as Enbridge, and identifies this
               abbreviated name in its cover letter to the project application.
           o The Board is aware that Enbridge conducted a restructuring and transferred assets
               to the Enbridge Income Fund. Enbridge is not required to seek authorization
               under section 74 of the National Energy Board Act for such a restructuring.
                                                                                              …/2
                                                  -2-
               For greater clarity, sections 74(1)(a) and (b) are triggered only when there is a
               sale, purchase, lease or transfer of physical pipeline assets, rather than extending
               to transactions where an interest in the company (direct or indirect), as opposed to
               pipeline assets, is transferred.
The issues you have raised in your correspondence are similar to those you have raised
previously with Board staff. Corporate changes of the type you have noted do not impinge on the
NEB's effectiveness as a regulator of pipelines in the Canadian public interest. They do not
detract from the full accountability to the Board and liability of the certificate holders (regardless
of name changes) for the safe and secure operation of pipelines.
Your correspondence states that you have concerns about the liability and risk issues related to
ownership of Enbridge pipelines and the transfer of assets. As a Commenter in the Enbridge

Physical and Operational Impacts of Pipeline Failures
There is a long record of oil and gas transmission pipeline failures in California earthquakes due
to ground shaking and liquefaction. The large majority of these have been joint failures where
the joints were constructed using oxy‐acetylene welds installed prior to approximately 1930.
Pipelines constructed using electric arc welding (post‐1930) have performed much better. There
has been only limited mixed experience of modern pipeline performance at fault crossings.
In the 1994 Northridge earthquake, there were 209 repairs required to metallic distribution
lines, and 27 to polyethylene lines. There were 35 non‐corrosion –related transmission pipeline
repairs of which 27 occurred on pipe joint with oxy‐acetylene girth welds in pre‐1930 pipelines.
At one of those failures, gas leaked from a failed 56‐cm line on Balboa Boulevard and was
ignited by the ignition system on a nearby truck (T. O’Rourke, 1994). The fire resulted in burning
nearby houses (Figure 1).
In the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake, PG&E had three failures of transmission lines, and
extensive damage to the cast iron distribution system in the San Francisco Marina District
resulting in an extensive pipe cast iron pipe replacement program using polyethylene. (EERI,
1990).
In the 1979 Imperial Valley Earthquake, three pipelines were impacted by fault movement; none
failed. A 10‐, 20‐, and 25‐cm pipe were subject from 40‐ to 60‐cm of movement. The 10‐cm line
had oxy‐acetylene welded joints, while the other two had electric arc welded joints. These lines
were operating at pressures of up to 725 psi. (Dobry, 1992).
In the 1971 San Fernando earthquake, over 80 transmission line failures occurred in pipelines
due to shaking that had oxy‐acetylene welded joints while less than five occurred in pipelines
with electric arc welded joints (including reconditioned joints). For transmission lines subjected
to permanent ground deformation, approximately 10 failures each occurred in oxy‐acetylene
and electric arc welded pipe. Failures in electric arc welded pipe occurred in areas with offsets
of two meters while no failures occurred in another are subjected to two to three meters of
displacement (O’Rourke, 1994).
In Washington State, two high pressure gas transmission line failures occurred in 1997, both
resulting from ground movement. Another failure occurred in 2003. One of the 1997 failures
resulted in an explosion. In 1999, a pipeline carrying gasoline failed due to damage caused by a
third party during construction on adjacent facilities. The pipeline failure resulted in discharging
277,000 gallons of product into a creek bed. In the ensuing fire, two boys burned to death, and
one young man was killed after he was overcome by fumes.
                                                   1
 In summary, modern steel pipelines with electric arc welded joints perform much better
pipelines with oxy‐acetylene welded joints (typically pre‐1930 construction). Steel pipelines have
performed well when subjected to ground displacements of 60 cm, but sometimes fail when
displacements reach several meters. High pressure gas lines do fail when subjected to
permanent ground deformation due to slides, and if an ignition source is available, can explode.
Gasoline leaked from a damaged product line fueled a fireball when ignited.
Exposed Assets
Pipeline information was acquired using the HSIP Gold database, provided in both Google Earth
and ArcGIS format. Six product pipelines were identified in areas of strong ground shaking, two
of which cross the fault at Cajon Pass. Three run westerly from the node/distribution terminal
in Colton towards Los Angeles, and one runs easterly from that same node as shown in Table 1.

Southern California Gas owns gas transmission and distribution pipelines throughout the region.
Twenty‐seven fault crossings were identified; eighteen transmission, and nine distribution
pipelines (some lines are counted multiple times as they cross multiple splays of the fault). Two
of these cross at Cajon Pass (transmission), one at San Bernardino (distribution), fourteen at
Palm Springs (seven transmission and seven distribution), and ten at Palmdale (nine
transmission and one distribution). The diameter of these lines is unknown. Southern California
                                                 2
 Gas’s entire pipeline inventory in areas with PGA’s exceeding 10 to 15 percent gravity are
subject to landslides and liquefaction/lateral spread through the region.
It is assumed that all of the product and gas transmission lines are constructed using welded
steel joints. Some of these pipelines may have been constructed using oxy‐acetylene welded
joints (typically pre‐1930), and some using electric arc welded joints (post‐1930). Some of the
distribution pipelines may be constructed of cast iron. In most cases, the cast iron would have
been replaced with polyethylene.
Vulnerability of Assets
Buried pipelines are vulnerable to permanent ground deformation and wave propagation
(shaking). Ground deformation can include fault rupture, landslide, and liquefaction and
associated lateral spreading and settlement. Pipe damage mechanisms include:
compression/wrinkling, joint weld cracking/separation (particularly for oxy‐acetylene welds),
bending/shear resulting from localized wrinkling, and tension.
This earthquake scenario is focusing on an event on the southern segment of the San Andreas
Fault that is expected to offset as much as 13 meters near the Salton Sea. A 4.5 meter offset is
expected at Cajon Pass. In addition to lateral movement, there may be an additional vertical
offset. The fault offset places the buried pipe in shear, compression, or tension depending on
the geometry of the pipe relative to the fault. The preferred alignment would be to place the
pipe in pure tension; the worst alignment would place the pipe in pure compression. In tension,
steel pipelines with welded joints can distribute tensile strain over hundreds of meters
minimizing localized stresses. Anchor points (valves of bends) can result in local stress
concentrations. By comparison, pipelines readily wrinkle in compression. It may be possible for
the pipelines crossing the San Andreas Fault at Cajon Pass to survive if they have been properly
designed. If special considerations were not taken into account, it is unlikely the pipelines could
accommodate 4.5 meters of offset. The American Lifelines Alliance (2001) estimates that high
quality welded steel pipe would have a failure about every 400 meters given these conditions.
The Colton‐Barstow CalNev pipelines and the Kinder Morgan Colton Yuma pipeline appear to
run parallel to and nearly on top of the fault. Depending on the exact fault location, this
alignment could put these pipelines into almost pure compression causing them to fail.
Landslides can load buried pipelines in a similar manner to fault rupture. Pipelines crossing block
landslide failures (but moving only several meters) laterally are put into shear at both edges of
the block. If they run through longitudinally, they are put into tension at the top of the slide, and
into compression at the toe. In catastrophic landslide failures, the pipe may be left unsupported.
It is difficult to speculate about vulnerability due to landslides without site specific assessments.
However for example, pipeline alignments approaching Cajon Pass, the Kinder Morgan pipeline
north of Redlands, and the Nogales‐Colton pipeline east of Whittier are all in rugged terrain,
subject to slides.
                                                   3
 Liquefaction and associated lateral spread and settlement occur in alluvial deposits with a
shallow groundwater table (less than 10 meters deep). Most of the study area receives minimal
rainfall, and as a result has a deep groundwater table. Additional information is required to
identify areas that might be vulnerable to liquefaction. If liquefaction does occur, the greatest
vulnerability occurs when buried pipelines move as part of large blocks of soil, down gradient.
The vulnerable locations are at the block interfaces. The pipelines are subject to similar loading
that would be encountered in landslides.
Compression wave propagation along pipelines puts them first in tension and then in
compression. Standing on the ground surface, humans feel this as shaking. Pipelines can readily
accommodate wave propagation moving the pipe tangential to its alignment.
Historically, steel pipelines with high quality electric arc welded joints perform very well in this
shaking environment. Pipelines with joints using oxy‐acetylene welds can have failure rates
nearly 100 times greater than those with electric arc welded joints.
The most extreme shaking intensity in the study area is expected to be about 250 cm/second,
located just north of Cajon Pass and in the Palm Dessert‐Coachella area along the Kinder
Morgan pipeline. For this level of shaking, the American Lifelines Alliance (2001) estimates
failure rates on the order of 0.4/km for high quality welded steel pipelines (Figure 2). Pipelines
in the San Bernardino and Palmdale areas would be expected to experience velocities of 150 to
200 cm/sec resulting in failure rates of 0.28/km for high quality electric arc joint welded pipe.
If a pipeline does fail, the consequences are dependent on its contents, its diameter, and the
pressure of its contents. The two general categories of contents are “product” including liquid
fuels that could be gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel, or other liquid fuels, and natural gas. The
operating pressure in natural gas pipelines can approach 1,000 psi. Gas released through
failures in small diameter low pressure gas mains (distribution mains) will generally dissipate
quickly. Failure of large diameter high pressure natural gas pipelines can result in an explosion
that can blast a crater in the surrounding soil, and damage nearby and overhead structures and
facilities (such as power transmission lines). In any case, an ignition source is required to initiate
the explosion. A human caused source could be a vehicle ignition system, cigarette lighter, or
spark from a metal on stone impact. There is speculation that pipelines running parallel to
overhead high voltage power transmission lines carry an induced current that could cause a
spark if the pipeline was ruptured. In any case, there is a high probability that there will be an
ignition source in the event of rupture of a high pressure pipeline. As evidenced by the fire that
occurred in Washington State, failure and leakage of gasoline can result in an extensive fire if an
ignition source exists. For some liquid fuels such as diesel, the potential for a fire is low, but
would result in environmental contamination.
Damage Scenario and Lifeline Interaction
Natural gas, gasoline, and diesel pipelines rupture at fault crossings at Cajon Pass, Palm Springs,
and Palmdale. A product line carrying gasoline ruptures at Cajon Pass; in the hills east of
                                                    4
 Whittier another product line fails spewing jet fuel into the air. The product receiving station
tank farm in Colton is heavily damaged.
One of the two Southern California Gas transmission pipelines at Cajon Pass will rupture at the
fault and explode (See Figure 3) resulting in a large crater (see Figure 4). The Southern California
Gas pipeline‐fault interface occurs where the pipeline intersects the CalNev 14‐inch product
pipeline, so when the explosion occurs the CalNev pipeline ruptures. The CalNev pipeline is
transporting gasoline, so the gasoline adds to the fire (see Figure 5). Power transmission lines
are overhead, and the fire reaches the lines causing them to fail.
The Southern California Gas pipeline is one of two parallel lines at Cajon Pass. Delayed by
highway damage and traffic congestion, operations personnel reach the site and isolate the
damaged pipe four hours after the earthquake occurs. Their second pipeline is taken out of
service as a precautionary measure to check for damage due to the 5 meter fault offset. The
second pipeline is temporarily put back in service until the ruptured one is repaired. CalNev
operations personnel reach the site and isolate their line 6 hours after the earthquake. Electrical
power is rerouted around the damaged transmission line.
The 20‐inch Kinder Morgan product line is ruptured in Palm Springs (Figure 6). The pipeline is
aligned directly over the fault. When the earthquake occurs, the pipeline is shortened five
meters causing it to wrinkle and rupture (Figure 7). The pipeline is carrying diesel which is
sprayed into the air. Ultimately 200,000 gallons of product is discharged into the local drainage
until the line can be isolated. A smaller natural gas distribution pipeline is located in the same
right‐of‐way. The fault displacement also ruptures this line. Although the volume of discharging
gas is much smaller than that coming from the break at Cajon Pass, the gas hampers response
efforts. The Kinder Morgan Pipeline fails at an additional 15 locations due to shaking at locations
along the 60 km alignment paralleling the fault trace. Each failure location requires
environmental cleanup of the discharged diesel product.
In Palmdale, a natural gas transmission line crosses the fault multiple times. It ruptures when
the earthquake occurs, spewing gas into the air. First responders quickly evacuate the area and
are able to keep the gas from igniting until a Southern California Gas crew arrives to isolate the
break.
A landslide in the hills east of Whittier shears off the 20‐inch Nogales pipeline in the hills east of
Whittier releasing jet fuel. 100,000 gallons of product is discharged before the line can be shut
down. The jet fuel finds its way into a local drainage.
The Colton Receiving Station (Figure 8) is subjected to 40 percent g shaking. The receiving
station is a node for distribution of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. The facility also controls flow of
jet fuel to March Air Force Base. Unanchored tanks bounce around breaking connecting pipe.
Fuel discharges into the retaining dikes, and is ignited by passing vehicle ignition system.
                                                   5
 Southern California Gas has small transmission and distribution piping throughout the impacted
area. In recent years, they have replaced most of the cast iron pipe in the distribution system
with polyethylene. They still suffer approximately 200 pipeline failures, primarily at fittings and
transitions.
Mitigation
To mitigate pipe failures, there is a series of possible mitigation measures that can be
considered on a site by site basis. Seismic resistant design of pipelines at fault crossings may be
the most effective compared to landslide and liquefaction areas because fault (particularly
strike‐slip faults) locations can be determined with reasonable accuracy. The same mitigation
measures can be employed for areas with high susceptibility to landslides or liquefaction/lateral
spreading except that the locations of block interfaces may be less certain. There may be an
opportunity to avoid landslide and liquefaction zones when selecting the alignment of new
pipelines. Selection of pipe joint design is important in mitigating pipe damage due to wave
propagation.
To mitigate damage due to permanent ground deformation (fault movement, landslide,
liquefaction) use modern welded steel pipe with butt electric arc welded joints. Replace old pipe
that has oxy acetylene welded joints within the fault zones and several thousand feet beyond.
The pipeline geometry should be designed so the pipe will go into tension when the fault moves.
Install the pipe with a coating/covering to minimize soil‐pipe friction allowing the pipe to easily
slide through the ground. Avoid use of “anchors” (valves, sharp bends, etc.) to allow the pipe to
move so that pipe stresses can be distributed along the pipe. Design the backfill to allow the
pipe to move laterally in the trench if required to accommodate the fault movement.
To mitigate damage due to wave propagation (shaking), use modern steel pipe employing
electric arc welded joints (the standard in the industry). Replace old (pre‐1930) pipe with oxy‐
acetylene welded joints.
To mitigate the consequence of pipe failure, implement an automated control system to allow
quick shutdown of the pipeline systems. Construct parallel (redundant) pipelines in independent
alignments so if one fails, the other may remain intact.

I did a search for Copetown Ontario on Mapquest and these are the Screenshots I
took of the results. The red dot is the intersection of HWY 52 and Governors Road.
The first map is the aerial photo with many water features seen, the other is an
illustrated map. The third map shows Enbridge Line 10 and the red dot illustrates
the same intersection.

  Sinkholes

                                         rock below
                                         the land surface is limestone, carbonate rock, salt beds, or
                                         rocks that can naturally be dissolved by groundwater
                                         circulating through them. As the rock dissolves, spaces and
                                         caverns develop underground. Sinkholes are dramatic because
                                         the land usually stays intact for a while until the underground
                                         spaces just get too big. If there is not enough support for the
                                         land above the spaces then a sudden collapse of the land
                                         surface can occur. These collapses can be small, or, as this
                                         picture shows, or they can be huge and can occur where a
                                         house or road is on top.
                                         The most damage from sinkholes tends to occur in Florida,
                                         Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and
                                         Pennsylvania. The picture to the left shows a sinkhole that
  quickly opened up in Florida, apparently eating a swimming pool, some roadway, and buildings.
  What is a "Sinkhole"?
  A sinkhole is an area of ground
  that has no natural external
  surface drainage­­when it rains,
  all of the water stays inside the
  sinkhole and typically drains into
  the subsurface. Sinkholes can
  vary from a few feet to hundreds
  of acres and from less than 1 to
  more than 100 feet deep. Some
  are shaped like shallow bowls or
  saucers whereas others have
  vertical walls; some hold water
  and form natural ponds.
  Typically, sinkholes form so
  slowly that little change is
  noticeable, but they can form
  suddenly when a collapse occurs.
  Such a collapse can have a
  dramatic effect if it occurs in an
  urban setting. This USGS picture shows a sinkhole that opened up too close to someone's home in
  Florida.
  Areas prone to collapse sinkholes
  The map below shows areas of the United States where certain rock types that are susceptible to
 dissolution in water occur. In these areas the formation of underground cavities can form and
catastrophic sinkholes can happen. These rock types are evaporites (salt, gypsum, and anhydrite) and
carbonates (limestone and dolomite). Evaporite rocks underlie about 35 to 40 percent of the United
States, though in many areas they are buried at great depths.
Types of sinkholes
Since Florida is prone to sinkholes, it is a good place to use to discuss some different types of
sinkholes and the geologic and hydrologic processes that form them. The processes of dissolution,
where surface rock that are soluble to weak acids, are dissolved, and suffosion, where cavities form
below the land surface, are responsible for virtually all sinkholes in Florida.
Dissolution sinkholes
                                                                          Dissolution of the limestone or
                                                                          dolomite is most intensive
                                                                          where the water first contacts
                                                                          the rock surface. Aggressive
                                                                          dissolution also occurs where
                                                                          flow is focussed in preexisting
                                                                          openings in the rock, such as
                                                                          along joints, fractures, and
                                                                          bedding planes, and in the zone
                                                                          of water­table fluctuation
                                                                          where groundwater is in
                                                                          contact with the atmosphere.
Cover­subsidence sinkholes
Cover­subsidence sinkholes tend to develop gradually where the covering sediments are permeable
and contain sand. In areas where cover material is thicker or sediments contain more clay, cover­
subsidence sinkholes are relatively uncommon, are smaller, and may go undetected for long periods.
 Cover­collapse sinkholes
Cover­collapse sinkholes may develop abruptly (over a period of hours) and cause catastrophic
damages. They occur where the covering sediments contain a significant amount of clay. Over time,
surface drainage, erosion, and deposition of sinkhole into a shallower bowl­shaped depression.
Sinkholes can be human­induced
                                         New sinkholes have been correlated to land­use practices,
                                         especially from groundwater pumping and from construction and
                                         development practices. Sinkholes can also form when natural
                                         water­drainage patterns are changed and new water­diversion
                                         systems are developed. Some sinkholes form when the land
                                         surface is changed, such as when industrial and runoff­storage
                                         ponds are created. The substantial weight of the new material can
                                         trigger an underground collapse of supporting material, thus
                                         causing a sinkhole.
                                         The overburden sediments that cover buried cavities in the aquifer
                                         systems are delicately balanced by groundwater fluid pressure.
                                         The water below ground is actually helping to keep the surface
                                         soil in place. Groundwater pumping for urban water supply and for
                                         irrigation can produce new sinkholes In sinkhole­prone areas. If
                                         pumping results in a lowering of groundwater levels, then
                                         underground structural failure, and thus, sinkholes, can occur.

The National Energy Board (NEB or the Board) expects regulated companies to demonstrate a proactive
commitment to continual improvement in safety, security and environmental protection, and to promote a
positive safety culture as part of their management systems.
Safety Advisories are issued periodically in order to improve the oil and gas industry’s awareness of an
identified safety or environmental concern with the goal of preventing incidents from occurring in the first
place. A Safety Advisory also serves to further highlight NEB requirements, and conveys the Board’s
expectation that regulated companies take appropriate action to mitigate any potential impacts to people or
the environment.

Standards for Manufactured Pipe & Fittings and
the Potential for Substandard Material Properties
Background
The National Energy Board (NEB or the Board) is aware of instances of pipe and components having
substandard material properties installed on pipelines under NEB or other regulatory bodies’ jurisdiction. In the
cases examined, documentation from the manufacturers indicated that the materials provided met the required
 specifications. Subsequent testing indicated that some of the pipe and fittings1 did not meet all of the
required material specifications. In some instances, the substandard materials were determined to have been
a contributing factor to pipeline failure during pressure testing or during operation.
Although some of the substandard materials cases described below appeared to have been isolated, the Board
subsequently identified additional cases on pipelines in Canada and the United States (US). The issue of pipe
and fittings having substandard material properties entering the market place, and subsequently being
installed on pipelines, is an industry wide concern.
US Advisory on Substandard Pipe Materials
In 2008, the US Department of Transportation, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration
(PHMSA) observed hydrostatic test failures and excessive expansions on a number of pipelines under
construction in the US. Upon investigation, PHMSA attributed the cause of the incidents to the installation of
pipe with substandard material properties.
In 2009, PHMSA issued an advisory bulletin (ADB­09­01) warning of the potential for micro­alloyed high
strength line pipe to exhibit inconsistent chemical and mechanical properties, with yield strengths as much as
15% below specified requirements. The advisory also warns that in some cases, the pipe materials may
successfully pass a hydrostatic test but still present a future concern.
Canadoil Asia Fitting Case
In December 2010, the NEB was notified of a steel fitting (elbow) that had expanded following a hydrostatic
test at a pipeline facility in the US. PHMSA attributed the cause of the elbow expansion to the fitting having a
yield strength lower than the specified minimum yield strength. The pipeline operator removed a number of
other fittings at the facility for mechanical testing and identified additional fittings with substandard material
properties.
The substandard fittings were traced to a manufacturer identified as Canadoil Asia2 with production originating
from Thailand. The fittings were manufactured to the Manufacturers Standard Society (MSS) SP­75
Specification for High­Test, Wrought, Butt­Welding Fittings and were indicated as having met the specified
material requirements on the Material Test Report (MTR). However, due to inadequacies in some processes at
the manufacturing plant, not all fittings met the specified material requirements.
EZEflow Fitting Case
In 2013, a pipeline rupture occurred on a sweet natural gas pipeline in Alberta. An estimated 16.5 million cubic
meters of natural gas was released. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) released its Pipeline
Investigation Report on the incident (P13H0107) on 3 November 2015.
Investigations by the TSB, the NEB, as well as the pipeline operator, indicated substandard materials were
present in the manufactured elbow where the failure initiated. Fitness for service testing was conducted on the
pipeline fittings prior to their installation in 2008, after two fittings failed during the pressure test. Although
hardness testing indicated the elbow in question had lower mechanical properties, the operator determined
that the elbow was acceptable for use, as the wall thickness would compensate for the lower mechanical
properties. Neither the manufacturer nor the pipeline operator physically verified the wall thickness of this
specific fitting. The investigation determined that the wall thickness was less than that indicated on the MTR.
Since this incident, the pipeline operating company has increased its manufactured fitting specifications
beyond the manufacturing standards acceptable under the current Canadian Standards Association
(CSA) Z662­15 Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems to prevent a similar incident from occurring. The fitting
manufacturer, EZEflow, has made improvements to both its manufacturing procedures and its quality assurance
(QA) programs. The quality issue appears to be limited to Grade 550 elbows manufactured for a single
customer.
Preventive Actions
The Board holds companies wholly responsible for assuring that the pipe and fittings they purchase meet the
specifications requested and required for the intended project.
As part of the NEB’s mandate to promote safety and security of pipelines, a more widespread and proactive
approach is being taken.
 Existing industry­accepted standards such as CSA Z245.11, CSA Z245.1, and MSS SP­75 have appeared to be
insufficient in preventing the manufacture of pipe and fittings with substandard material properties. The CSA
and MSS standards are living documents that are updated as needed. Both CSA and MSS are receptive to
making any required updates to the standards, and the Board will continue to communicate with them on this
issue.
As the changes necessary to identify substandard material properties have not yet been made in the
standards, the Board expects companies to develop or enhance their own fitting specifications beyond the
current standards to ensure that the fittings they acquire and install meet the material property requirements.
Pipeline companies regulated by the NEB must develop specifications for the pipe and components to be used
in a pipeline and shall submit them to the Board when required to do so, as per section 14 of the National
Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations (OPR). Companies shall have QA programs in place to ensure that
the pipe and components meet the specifications developed by the company, as required by section 15 of the
OPR. Reviewing MTRs, without independent onsite verification, may not provide sufficient protection against
the introduction of substandard components. Companies should exert greater oversight in the manufacturing
process directly and/or indirectly through third party QA.
The NEB may issue additional guidance to companies on what changes are expected to be made to companies’
internal specifications and QA programs.

                   DRAFT Recovery Strategy for the Jefferson Salamander in Ontario
DECLARATION
The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources has led the development of this recovery
strategy for the Jefferson Salamander in accordance with the requirements of the
Endangered Species Act (ESA 2007). This recovery strategy has been prepared as
advice to the Government of Ontario, other responsible jurisdictions and the many
different constituencies that may be involved in recovering the species.
The recovery strategy does not necessarily represent the views of all of the individuals
who provided advice or contributed to its preparation or the official positions of the
organizations with which the individuals are associated.
The goals, objectives and recovery approaches identified in the strategy are based on
the best available knowledge and are subject to revision as new information becomes
available. Implementation of this strategy is subject to appropriations, priorities, and
budgetary constraints of the participating jurisdictions and organizations.
Success in the recovery of this species depends on the commitment and cooperation of
many different constituencies that will be involved in implementing the directions set out
in this strategy.

                    DRAFT Recovery Strategy for the Jefferson Salamander in Ontario
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This recovery strategy outlines the objectives and strategies necessary for the
protection and recovery of Canadian populations of the Jefferson Salamander,
Ambystoma jeffersonianum. This recovery strategy was developed with the goal of
ensuring that existing threats to populations and habitat are sufficiently reversed to
allow for long term persistence and expansion of A. jeffersonianum within its existing
Canadian range. The strategy is based on a comprehensive review of current and
historical population census data and research in addition to genetic analyses that
provide accurate identifications of this salamander species and members of the A.
laterale – jeffersonianum complex.
Ambystoma jeffersonianum populations have a distinctive genetic evolutionary history.
Ontario populations coexist with unisexual individuals that are mostly polyploidy with a
predominance of A. jeffersonianum chromosomes; and which together are referred to
as members of the A. laterale – jeffersonianium complex. Ambystoma jeffersonianum
and polyploids utilize the same habitat and the polyploids are reproductively dependant
on A. jeffersonianum. That is, the presence of jeffersonianum-dominated polyploid eggs
necessarily means that A. jeffersonianum is present as a sperm donor for those
unisexual polyploids. For these reasons, the recommendations in this recovery strategy
relating to the identification, mapping and protection of habitat apply to both A.
jeffersonianum and jeffersonianum-dominated polyploids. The apparent absence or
non-documentation of an A. jeffersonianum individual is often the result of naturally low
relative abundance and/or limited search effort (Bogart and Klemens 2008).
Major threats to A. jeffersonianum in Ontario include: habitat loss, habitat fragmentation
and degradation/alteration, road mortality, impairment of wetland/hydrologic function
and the introduction of fish to breeding ponds.
The conservation biology of A. jeffersonianum is well known in comparison to other
species at risk in Ontario. This recovery strategy provides the scientific basis with which
to establish habitat protection guidelines and make recommendations to protect this
species in Ontario. Towards this end, this recovery strategy also outlines and prioritizes
recovery approaches and programs. Because known A. jeffersonianum populations
exist in areas that are presently under development pressure, there is an urgent need to
implement the recovery approaches and to communicate the recovery goals with
municipalities, developers, and other stakeholders where conflicts exist or are
anticipated.
It is recommended that the habitat regulation for A. jeffersonianum include:
     • all wetlands or wetland features that provide suitable breeding conditions where
         A. jeffersonianum and jeffersonianum-dominated polyploids occur,
     • terrestrial habitat areas within 300 m from the edge of the breeding ponds that
         provide conditions required for foraging, dispersal, migration, and hibernation,
         and
                                            iv
                  DRAFT Recovery Strategy for the Jefferson Salamander in Ontario
    •  corridors that provide contiguous connections between breeding locations (up to
       a maximum distance of 1 km).
Any newly discovered breeding locations and associated terrestrial habitat as well as
extirpated and historical locations where suitable habitat remains should also be
included within the regulation.

1.2      Species Description and Biology
Species Description
Ambystoma jeffersonianum is a relatively large (65 to 96 mm Snout to Vent Length)
grey to brownish-grey salamander. Ambystoma jeffersonianum egg masses were
described by Bishop (1947). The eggs are incorporated in gelatinous masses that are
attached to sticks and plant stems. Each egg mass contains 16 to 40 large (2.0 to 2.5
mm) eggs. The individual eggs contain a black or dark brown embryo that is enclosed
by a distinct envelope. The eggs are surrounded by a loose, watery protective gel layer.
The dark melanin pigment and the jelly covering (and any algae within), along with
dissolved organic matter in the water, protect the developing embryos from damage
through exposure to ultraviolet -B radiation (Licht 2003). Individual females lay several
such egg masses with a complete complement of more than 200 eggs depending on
female size.
Breeding success can be variable from year to year depending on spring weather and
water level conditions. However, because A. jeffersonianum are long lived (up to 30
years) populations can be resilient to such variable reproductive output. Eggs complete
their development in two to four weeks (depending primarily on water temperature).
Hatchlings have a total length of 10 to 14 mm. Transformation from larvae to adults
normally occurs in July and August when juveniles move out of the pond and seek
shelter in the forest litter. The larval stage can be variable, and can extend into early
September.

                   DRAFT Recovery Strategy for the Jefferson Salamander in Ontario
Species Biology - Genetics
The unusual reproductive biology and genetics of the A. jeffersonianum have presented
a number of challenges in formulating recovery recommendations. The summary below
is intended to explain the main aspects of the A. laterale (blue-spotted salamander) –
jeffersonianum complex.
Ambystoma jeffersonianum populations normally coexist with unisexual individuals that
are mostly polyploid with a predominance of A. jeffersonianum chromosomes; and
which together are referred to as members of the A. laterale – jeffersonianum complex.
The presence of the eggs of jeffersonianum-dominated polyploids necessarily and
absolutely indicates the presence of breeding pure A. jeffersonianum which is required
as a sperm donor to initiate egg development of jeffersonianum-dominated polyploids
(Bogart and Klemens 1997; 2008, Rye and Weller 2000, OMNR 2008 unpublished
data). In Ontario, there is absolute correspondence between pure A. jeffersonianum
and jeffersonianum-dominated polyploids, as is the case in New England and New York
(Bogart and Klemens 1997; 2008). Pure jeffersonianum and jeffersonianum-dominated
polyploids can not be separated by habitat or in many cases by morphology. Therefore,
genetic analysis is often required to distinguish pure jeffersonianum from polyploids and
particularly pure female jeffersonianum. Ambystoma laterale and laterale-dominated
polyploids are the other members of the complex. Polyploids dominated by the A.
laterale are not indicative of A. jeffersonianum. Polyploid members of the complex are
generally triploid, but tetraploid and pentaploid individuals have also been documented
(Bogart 2003).
Contrary to earlier theories, there is no evidence of past or present hybridization among
the members of the A. laterale – jeffersonianium complex (Bogart 2003). Mitochondrial
DNA from polyploid females predates that of A. jeffersonianum and A. laterale (Bogart
et al. 2007), and has been matched with that of a Kentucky population of Ambystoma
barbouri (Bogart 2003). The genetic mixing which occurs within the polyploid
component of the complex is attributed to an unusual reproductive strategy
(gynogenesis) where polyploid females lay mostly unreduced eggs (eggs whose ploidy
is equivalent to that of the parent’s somatic cells), and where sperm from a diploid male
is required solely to initiate egg development (Elinson et al. 1992). Occasionally,
reduced eggs will be present in an egg mass, and genetic material from sperm can be
incorporated into the embryos (Bogart 2003).
Jeffersonianum-dominated polyploids demonstrate the same ecology and use of habitat
as pure A. jeffersonianum (Bériault 2005, OMNR 2008). However, jeffersonianum-
dominated polyploids occur at much greater relative abundance, normally comprising 90
– 95% of local populations (Bogart and Klemens 2008; 1997, OMNR 2008 unpublished
data). Therefore, many search efforts focused on finding A. jeffersonianum using a
random sampling of the population would likely encounter only jeffersonianum-
dominated polyploids. Because A. jeffersonianum and jeffersonianum-dominated
polyploids can not be separated by habitat, and because the perpetuation of the
polyploid component of the complex is dependent on the presence of A. jeffersonianum;
                                                2
                    DRAFT Recovery Strategy for the Jefferson Salamander in Ontario
the recommendations in this recovery strategy relating to the identification, description,
mapping, and protection of habitat apply to both A. jeffersonianum and jeffersonianum-
dominated polyploids. The state of Connecticut has gone one step further and has
afforded equal protection to polyploids (Bogart and Klemens 2008).
Ecological Role
The presence of A. jeffersonianum is critical to the survival and existence of
unisexuals that make up the majority of the population complex and utilize A.
jeffersonianum males as sperm donors.
Larvae of A. jeffersonianum are voracious aquatic predators that feed on moving prey
items such as insect larvae, small crustaceans, and amphibian larvae. Adults are likely
prey items for wetland predators, such as snakes, rodents, and birds like the Red-
shouldered Hawk. A. jeffersonianum plays an important role in channeling nutrients
between the aquatic environment and the upland wooded environment and is an
indicator species of high quality vernal pools.
1.3      Distribution, Abundance and Population Trends
Global Range
The Canadian range of A. jeffersonianum is restricted to southern Ontario, particularly
along the Niagara Escarpment World Biosphere Reserve. In the United States, A.
jeffersonianum ranges from New York and New England south and southwestward to
Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia, and Virginia. An ecological isolate occurs in east-
central Illinois (Petranka 1998) (Fig. 1). For much of this range, genetic data are
unavailable so the continental distribution of pure A. jeffersonianum and jeffersonianum-
dominated polyploids is uncertain (Bogart and Klemens 1997).
The current Global Natural Heritage Status Rank for A. jeffersonianum was assigned by
the Association for Biodiversity Information (ABI) (NatureServe 2008). Their ranking for
A. jeffersonianum is “G4”, a level of ranking assigned to species with greater than 100
site occurrences and greater than 10,000 individuals, giving the species a secure rating
globally. NatureServe also applies Natural Heritage Status rankings at the national (N)
and sub-national (S) (i.e., provinces or states) level. Rankings for the Canadian and
U.S. populations are summarized in Table 1. Notably, in addition to being listed as
threatened in Ontario and Canada, the species has been designated as imperiled (S2)
in Illinois and Vermont and is only considered to be secure (S4) in five of the 14 states
where it is found.

Canadian Range
The distribution of A. jeffersonianum in Canada as of October 2008 is based on
approximately 328 breeding ponds representing approximately 27 discrete populations.
This data is based on both extant and historic occurrences.
Figure 2 provides the most current locality information based on a compilation of
databases. COSEWIC and COSSARO have both assigned the species a “threatened”
status to the species. The National Heritage Information Center (NHIC 2003) has
assigned it an “S2” rank (i.e. very rare in Ontario; usually between 5 and 20 element
occurrences in the province, or few remaining hectares, or with many individuals in
fewer occurrences; often susceptible to extirpation). The S-rank only applies to pure A.
jeffersonianum, which, by virtue of their very low relative abundance within the complex,
means they are exceedingly rare.
In Ontario, known extant populations of A. jeffersonianum occur in:
       1) Haldimand - Norfolk Region;
       2) forested habitat along the Niagara Escarpment from the Hamilton area to
           Orangeville;
       3) isolated localities in Halton and Peel Regions;
       4) Dufferin County East of the Escarpment;
       5) in Waterloo Region; and
       6) a few isolated ponds in York Region and on the Oak Ridges Moraine.
A population in Wellington County, South of Guelph is likely extirpated. The last
salamanders were observed at that site in April 1989 (Bogart unpublished) and the
breeding pond was dry in successive years (1990 – 1993). Historically, A.
jeffersonianum was probably much more widely distributed throughout southwestern
and south-central Ontario prior to the clearing of forests for agriculture.
Percent Global Distribution in Canada
Populations of A. jeffersonianum in Canada are situated at the northern limit of the
species’ North American range. The Canadian populations probably represent a
maximum of 1-3 % of the estimated North American population based on relative
ranges (Rye and Weller 2000) (Figure 1).

Population Sizes and Trends
A. jeffersonianum was first recognized to occur in Canada by Weller and Sprules in
1976. Based on our present knowledge, the current isolated populations are remnants
of what was once a more extensive, (i.e., continuous) range throughout southern
Ontario. Fragmentation and loss of habitat has led to the isolation of these populations.
In the part of the province located south and east of the Canadian Shield, over 70% of
the original woodlands have been lost since European settlement (Riley and Mohr
1994). Habitats have been further lost and fragmented as a result of large scale
agriculture, urbanization, road networks, and resource development activities, such as
aggregate extraction.
As denoted in Section 1.3, Canadian Range; there are approximately 27 known
populations of A. jeffersonianum in Ontario. One breeding pond does not necessarily
represent a population; there may be several or many breeding ponds within an area
that supports a discrete population. Populations are represented by one or more
breeding ponds within an area of contiguous suitable habitat.
Available population census information does not permit an assessment of global
abundance trends for this species. Its current Global Natural Heritage Status Ranking
is “G4” (NatureServe 2008) which indicates that the species is apparently secure within
its range. However, in Ontario, threats to A. jeffersonianum, discussed in Section 1.6,
are well known and cumulative loss and impairment of habitat continues.
Temporal trends for this species are not readily available because of the identification
challenges of A. jeffersonianum and the unisexual nuclear hybrids. As stated earlier,
jeffersonianum-dominated polyploids occur at much greater relative abundance,
normally comprising 90 – 95% of local populations (Bogart and Klemens 1997; 2008,
OMNR 2008 unpublished data). This means that pure A. jeffersonianum represents
only 5-10% of the relative abundance of the population (Bogart and Klemens 2008).
Normally, estimations of distribution of vertebrate species may be obtained from
museum records and voucher specimens. Such historical identifications of A.
jeffersonianum as well as available museum records are, however, not necessarily
accurate. Bishop (1947), in his classic book on North American salamanders, lumped all
of the presently recognized members of the complex (A. laterale, A. jeffersonianum and
all of the unisexuals) in a single species, A. jeffersonianum. Until 1964, most museum
curators adhered to Bishop’s nomenclature without the benefit of genetic confirmation.
However, it is now understood that it is not possible to distinguish most individuals of
the complex that are catalogued in major museum collections.
Uzzell (1964) tried to establish ranges for A. jeffersonianum by sorting the males into A.
laterale and A. jeffersonianum and by using blood cell size to distinguish diploid and
triploid females. Uzzell’s ranges for A. jeffersonianum were based on very few
individuals (8 from Massachusetts; 1 from New Jersey; 37 from New York; and 1 from
Vermont). Bogart and Klemens (1997) provided a more accurate range of A.
                                                8
                   DRAFT Recovery Strategy for the Jefferson Salamander in Ontario
jeffersonianum in New York and New England through the isozyme screening of 1,006
individuals from 106 sites. That large sample only provided 66 pure A. jeffersonianum
individuals (6.59%). The global range (Fig. 1) is based on limited data and many
regions still require genetic confirmation.
A. jeffersonianum individuals occur in all of the populations shown in Fig. 2 (Bogart
1982; Bogart and Cook 1991; Lamond 1994; Bogart unpublished information), but some
of these localities have not been revisited for more than 10 years.
Despite genetic identification difficulties, the available population data shows a declining
trend (Rye and Weller 2000).
1.4     Habitat Needs
Breeding Ponds
During the first spring rains in March and April, adults migrate overland to breeding
ponds (e.g., vernal pools) at night where mating and oviposition take place. A.
jeffersonianum use a range of wetland types for breeding. Breeding ponds are
generally vernal pools that are either fed by groundwater (e.g., springs), snowmelt or
surface waters. These types of ponds normally dry in mid to late summer. Other types
of wetlands used for breeding may have permanent or semi-permanent water. The
ponds are generally located within a woodland or in proximity to a woodland. A.
jeffersonianum individuals demonstrate strong pond fidelity, returning to the same pond
each year to breed.
Low shrubs, twigs, fallen tree branches, submerged riparian vegetation or emergent
vegetation are required for egg mass attachment.
Research has shown that the depth of the water, water temperature, pH, and other
water chemistry and water quality parameters are not good predictors of the use of
breeding ponds by A. jeffersonianum (Bériault 2005). In central Pennsylvania, one of
the few regions in which the unisexuals do not co-exist with A. jeffersonianum,
embryonic (larval) mortality was high in ponds below pH 4.5. Because A.
jeffersonianum larvae are not particularly susceptible to relatively low pH (Beriault pers.
comm.), mortality was probably affected by the availability of prey items (Sadinski and
Dunson 1992).
Food (prey items) must be present in the ponds. Known aquatic prey items include
small aquatic invertebrates and amphibian larvae.
Breeding ponds must not contain fish that are capable of preying upon A.
jeffersonianum in order for egg masses, juveniles and adult A. jeffersonianum to be
successful.
                                                9
                   DRAFT Recovery Strategy for the Jefferson Salamander in Ontario
The hydrologic and hydrogeologic integrity of breeding habitat must be maintained.
This requires that both surface water hydrology and groundwater contributions are not
disrupted, altered or diminished. Hydrologic assessments are required for any adjacent
land use that may impact ground or surface water supporting the breeding pond.
Terrestrial Habitat
Terrestrial habitat is used by A. jeffersonianum during all parts of its life cycle including
migrating to and from breeding ponds, summer and fall movement and foraging, and
overwintering. A number of terrestrial habitats are used by A. jeffersonianum. Most
often, A. jeffersonianum are associated with deciduous or mixed woodlands. Terrestrial
habitat must contain microhabitat, such as rodent burrows, rock fissures, downed
woody debris, tree stumps and buttresses, leaf litter, logs, etc. Other than during
migration and breeding, this microhabitat is where A. jeffersonianum reside. A.
jeffersonianum overwinter in the ground below the frost line (deep rock fissures and
rodent burrows). Summer burrows are horizontal and winter burrows are vertical
(Faccio 2003). A. jeffersonianum are also known to show fidelity to their terrestrial
habitat (Thompson et al. 1980, OMNR 2008 unpublished data).
Food (prey items) in the terrestrial habitat include insects, earthworms and other
invertebrates.
Migratory movements occur in a variety of habitats including woodlands, plantations,
agricultural fields, early successional areas, and across roads. Radio tracking studies
have documented that the migratory distance of adults of the jeffersonianum complex
can range from hundreds of metres up to 1 km from the breeding pond into surrounding
habitat (Bériault 2005, Faccio 2003, Semlitsch 1998, OMNR 2008 unpublished data).
However, radio telemetry studies in Ontario also found that 90% of adults reside in
suitable habitat within 300 m surrounding their breeding pond (Bériault 2005, OMNR
2008 unpublished data).
1.5     Limiting Factors
Factors affecting A. jeffersonianum include the limited availability of the habitats
required by the species, i.e., vernal pools or fishless wetlands in woodlands for
breeding, and loose, moist soils in deciduous or mixed woodlands in terrestrial sites for
burrowing.
Climate change may also have an effect on the timing and success of the breeding
season.
Limiting Factors in Breeding Ponds
In order for breeding to be successful, there needs to be an adequate amount of
suitable egg attachment sites. There also needs to be an adequate amount of food
(prey items) within the pond. All life stages of A. jeffersonianum are vulnerable to
                                                10
                  DRAFT Recovery Strategy for the Jefferson Salamander in Ontario
predation by fish; therefore, ponds containing predatory fish capable of preying upon A.
jeffersonianum are not suitable as habitat. Many forested wetlands are connected by
stream systems that provide access for fish. Therefore, the limited occurrence of vernal
pools and fishless wetlands in woodlands is in itself, a limiting factor.
Egg and larval mortality have been observed to be high in ponds used by most
populations of A. jeffersonianum, but these dead eggs are usually attributed to the
polyploids. Larval mortality is also high among polyploid individuals (Bogart and Licht
1986). In some years, populations can be impacted by ponds drying or freezing
completely when adult salamanders are breeding or prior to larval transformation.
Limiting Factors in the Terrestrial Habitat
The terrestrial habitat must have an adequate humus layer, leaf litter, stumps, logs, root
holes, rock fissures, appropriate soil type, and mammal burrows for feeding, moisture
retention, and predator avoidance.
1.6     Threats to Survival and Recovery
The following threats to Jefferson salamander are presented in order of priority.
Habitat Loss or Degradation
Anthropogenic threats include development activities that result in the cumulative loss
and degradation of habitat and fragmentation of breeding ponds and woodlands.
Activities associated with urbanization, aggregate extraction and resource development
are the most significant threats to A. jeffersonianum in southern Ontario. The range of
A. jeffersonianum is concentrated along the Niagara Escarpment which is a significant
aggregate extraction area.
Impacts from development include; site clearing and grading that alter cover,
topography and drainage patterns; storm water management and increases in
impervious cover that alter natural hydroperiod regimes; water balance of adjacent
wetlands and moisture content of soils; and silt fencing that prevents and/or hinders
migration of salamanders. Urbanization, aggregate extraction and roads can result in
the loss, impairment and fragmentation of habitat. In addition to direct habitat loss and
fragmentation, any resource development activity that may alter the water table or
cause a disruption or modification to groundwater flow has the potential to alter wetland
hydroperiods and breeding habitat, water balance, wetland function, and soil moisture
regimes in adjacent A. jeffersonianum habitat.
Roads
Roads (and urbanization) can create barriers that limit salamander dispersal and
abundance and fragment habitat. Individuals are frequently killed by vehicles while
                                               11
                   DRAFT Recovery Strategy for the Jefferson Salamander in Ontario
crossing roads, and curbs and catch basins may act as barriers and traps, respectively,
for salamanders. Roads also are a source of chemicals and pollutants (e.g., salt) that
degrade adjacent aquatic and terrestrial habitat. Roads create zones of disturbance
that are characterized by noise and light pollution, and contribute to desiccation of
migrating adults and increased vulnerability to predators.
Changes in Ecological Dynamics
Relevant to this discussion is an examination of why A. jeffersonianum were not found
in some sites in recent years. Perhaps the species is extirpated in these populations.
Data again are limited, but habitat changes associated with anthropogenic disturbance
likely are factors. Premature drying of ponds can result from the removal of a part of the
protective canopy, drawing down the water table in developed areas, or altering water
courses for snow melt and runoff. The reduction of vernal pond “envelopes” and buffer
zones also have been suggested as contributing to the reduction and possible
elimination of species of Ambystoma (Calhoun and Klemens 2002).
Forestry Activities
As A. jeffersonianum is generally associated with deciduous woodlands, the terrestrial
habitat of the species is vulnerable to forestry activities. Forestry activities and the
equipment used may result in the filling of vernal pools, alteration of vernal pool
hydrology, sedimentation, removal or alteration of associated upland habitat (canopy
cover, removal of stumps, logs and leaf litter, and altering nutrient inputs by leaves),
pollution, and fragmentation or isolation of vernal pools from the terrestrial habitat.
Recreation and Trails
High traffic recreation trails in proximity to breeding pools and terrestrial habitat may
also result in salamander mortality or habitat degradation from trampling by hikers,
cyclists, and All Terrain Vehicles.
Unauthorized Collections and Introduced Species
Collection for the pet trade of amphibians and reptiles is a growing concern and may be
a threat to A. jeffersonianum. Knowledge of the species’ whereabouts by the general
public is not widespread, and nocturnal migration and breeding activities occur during
very few rainy nights early in the spring and in late summer/early fall for juveniles. A
bigger incidental human threat is the addition of carnivorous fish to breeding ponds
which are predators on all life stages.

                   DRAFT Recovery Strategy for the Jefferson Salamander in Ontario
1.7      Knowledge Gaps
Key knowledge gaps include (but are not limited to):
   1. Effectiveness of mitigation efforts to address threats and means of reducing road
       mortality
    2. Refinement of distribution and range particularly in portions of the Oak Ridges
       Moraine and the Greenbelt
   3. Juvenile dispersal patterns, timing and distances
   4. Fall migration
   5. Information on overwintering sites
These five knowledge gaps have been grouped under two headings:
Threat Clarification Research Requirements
To date, there has been insufficient research focused directly on natural and human
threats to this species. Direct threats, such as habitat loss associated with resource
development and urbanization, need to be quantified and evaluated within the context of
cumulative impacts on the distribution and abundance of A. jeffersonianum. Indirect
threats (e.g., development activities that cause changes to wetland hydrology on
adjacent lands) require detailed investigations and monitoring to determine cause and
affect relationships and to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed mitigations. All
potential threats to A. jeffersonianum should be investigated empirically and weighted
against other threats. Threats are often difficult to manage; therefore, it is important to
amass empirical data to support recovery planning in consultation with planning
authorities, developers and stakeholders.
Biological/Ecological Research Requirements
Little is known about the dispersal patterns of juvenile A. jeffersonianum. It is theorized
that juveniles would potentially disperse further than adults to establish new breeding
ponds and/or populations when the carrying capacity has been reached in existing
breeding ponds (Bogart pers. com.).
All of the telemetry studies completed to date have focused on the
spring/summer migration of adults. Future telemetry studies are required to
research the fall migration. This would also help with obtaining more information
on A. jeffersonianum overwintering sites and terrestrial habitat use. Information
such as microhabitat use, communal or individual use of sites, etc. would be
explored.
1.8      Recovery Actions Completed or Underway
Work on several of the recovery objectives has been initiated and a number of studies
on the species have been completed.

                    DRAFT Recovery Strategy for the Jefferson Salamander in Ontario
Research on Habitat Use and Spatial Requirements (Recovery Objective II)
In 2004, radio telemetry studies of a southern Ontario A. jeffersonianum population
were initiated by the University of Guelph (Bériault 2005). These studies focused on the
movement and habitat use of LJJ 3 polyploids (sample size of 16). In order to increase
the sample size of radio-tagged salamanders and to investigate additional questions
relating to habitat use, movements and population demographics, the study was
continued and expanded in 2005 by MNR. Radio transmitters were implanted in 17
additional polyploids from the same location and in 9 and 10 individuals respectively at
two different sites in Peel Region. In 2007 and 2008, MNR conducted additional radio
telemetry monitoring of both polyploids and pure A. jeffersonianum at a site in Halton
Region. With an additional 59 salamanders monitored, for a total sample size of 111,
these studies have generated extensive data on the movements and terrestrial habitat
use of A. jeffersonianum and jeffersonianum-dominated polyploids. These findings, in
addition to other referenced studies, provide the basis for the recommendations for
habitat regulations found in Section 2.5.
Monitoring Extant Occurrences and Searching for New Breeding Ponds (Recovery
Objectives I and V)
In 2002 and 2003, the recovery team worked with the Regional Municipality of York to
determine whether A. jeffersonianum populations existed within York Region. Field
investigations revealed four populations of A. jeffersonianum. These four populations
are the only ones known in York Region and represent the most eastern distribution of
this species in Ontario.
In 2003, the recovery team formed a partnership with the University of Guelph to update
the database of all known A. jeffersonianum and polyploid occurrences. Since 2003,
more than 100 wetlands with the potential to support Ambystoma sp. have been
searched for A. jeffersonianum. Fifteen new breeding sites have been documented
while some of the historical breeding locations have been confirmed to be extirpated
because of habitat disturbance or loss. Because of the elusive nature of this species,
the limited window of time to find them, and the fact that they may not breed every year
if conditions are not appropriate, it is difficult to determine with certainty that a breeding
location is extirpated. These findings highlight the rarity of A. jeffersonianum,
particularly in areas off the Niagara Escarpment.
Also in 2003-2004, the Niagara Escarpment Commission, in partnership with the
University of Guelph, and under the direction of the recovery team, undertook a study to
examine the location and habitat conditions of A. jeffersonianum breeding sites along
the Niagara Escarpment. The study focused on historically known breeding locations
that had been documented by the University of Guelph in 1990 and 1991. Eighteen

Escarpment sites were searched for A. jeffersonianum egg masses by staff from
Ontario's Niagara Escarpment (ONE) Monitoring Program. Three sites were confirmed
to have A. jeffersonianum with the remaining 15 sites no longer supporting A.
jeffersonianum or polyploids.
In 2004, also under the direction of the recovery team, a number of Conservation
Authorities (including Grand River Conservation Authority, Hamilton Conservation,
Conservation Halton, Credit Valley Conservation, and Toronto and Region
Conservation) continued to contribute to the recovery process and recovery planning by
allocating staff time and resources to revisit vernal pools previously known to support A.
jeffersonianum and to investigate other potential habitats within their watersheds.
In 2006, and continuing in 2007, University of Toronto at Mississauga, Evergreen,
EcoSource Mississauga and Credit Valley Conservation have, under direction of the
recovery team, partnered to assess both habitat conditions and potential human-related
impacts to an A. jeffersonianum breeding pond in Peel Region. Information gathered
through this project will contribute to the understanding of ground water contributions to
the breeding pond, and of habitat impacts associated with recreational trails.
Species and Ploidy Identification
At the University of Guelph, microsatellite molecular markers for A. jeffersonianum
(Julian et al. 2003) have been and continue to be effectively used to identify diploid A.
jeffersonianum and distinguish polyploid members of the complex. These markers may
also address other questions regarding population dynamics and genetics that involve
the unisexual part of the complex.
Public Contact and Education (Objectives IV)
Many of the recovery team members are associated with or work for regional
conservation groups or authorities. In May 2003, workshops were run by MNR in
Halton Region and Waterloo Region. These workshops were attended by Recovery
Team members and provided instruction on egg mass identification and outlined the
protocol for obtaining samples for genetic analyses.
Aurora District MNR has produced a Guideline for Applicants for Wildlife Scientific
Collectors Authorizations (2007). This guideline includes detailed direction on collection
methodologies and study design requirements that are directly applicable to A.
jeffersonianum. MNR and the recovery team have worked extensively with a number of
consultants, the aggregates industry and conservation authorities in providing direction
on collection methodologies and protocols.

2.0     RECOVERY
2.1     Recovery Goal
The recovery goal is to ensure that existing threats to populations and habitat are
sufficiently reversed to allow for long-term persistence and expansion of the Jefferson
Salamander, A. jeffersonianum, within its existing Canadian range.
2.2     Protection and Recovery Objectives
The priority of the short-term recovery objectives, and the overall recovery goal, is the
protection of existing populations of A. jeffersonianum by ensuring no further loss of
known habitat or potentially suitable habitat (recovery habitat). Habitat protection is
critical to the survival of the species. Protection of existing habitat should have
priority over compensation for lost habitat (i.e., created habitat). Consistent with general
principles of conservation biology for species at risk, compensatory measures such as
habitat creation and relocation efforts should only be undertaken as a last resort and
when other measures have proved unsuccessful.
Protection, restoration, and enhancement of existing A. jeffersonianum habitat are the
priority recovery planning recommendations. Habitat alterations which would adversely
impact A. jeffersonianum should be discouraged.
At present, there is no basis for protection of newly created features (e.g., breeding
ponds) because colonization and use of such features has not been sufficiently
documented. Created habitat cannot immediately replace existing habitat utilized by A.
jeffersonianum.
In addition, long-term forest and wetland restoration or remediation proposals (i.e.,
potentially decades) intended to compensate for losses of existing habitat are not in
keeping with recovery planning for species at risk.

2.4     Performance Measures
Performance measures have been identified that will evaluate the success and progress
of the recovery approaches set out in this strategy. These measures will also indicate
the extent to which the objectives have been met. Examples include:
    •   population trends (increase/decrease) and confirmation of breeding activity
    •   quantify new/extirpated populations
    •   consistent baseline information generated from the long-term control site
    •   number and participation of stakeholders involved in related stewardship and
        monitoring
    •   number of locations for which identified threats have been reduced, mitigated or
        eliminated
    •   assessment of mitigation techniques (e.g., culverts, silt fencing, artificial
        recharge)
    •   increased knowledge of aquatic and terrestrial habitat (e.g., telemetry research)
    •   number of municipalities that adopt habitat regulation and protection policies in
        their Official Plans
    •   recommendations used to inform the habitat regulation process under the ESA
        2007
    •   identification of methods to study, assess and characterize hydrology of breeding
        habitat
2.5     Area for Consideration in Developing a Habitat Regulation
Habitat is defined in the ESA 2007 as an area on which the species depends, directly or
indirectly, to carry on its life processes, including life processes such as reproduction,
rearing, hibernation, migration or feeding. Specifically, for A. jeffersonianum, the
following is a description of the area that is recommended for inclusion in the habitat
regulation.
Breeding Habitat
All wetlands or wetland features that provide suitable breeding conditions for A.
jeffersonianum and jeffersonianum-dominated polyploids such as vernal pools,
woodland pools, deciduous swamps, spring fed pools, ground water supported
wetlands, sloughs, old deepened or created ponds or ditches where breeding A.
jeffersonianum occur should be included within the habitat regulation.
All such wetlands and features have egg attachment sites, and have a sufficient
combination of hydro-period, temperature and productivity to support the deposition and
development of eggs and larvae. However, breeding habitat can be dynamic and
conditions variable from year to year depending on precipitation and water levels. This
can result in variable breeding success and activity from year to year. For this reason,
surveys intended to determine the presence of A. jeffersonianum in new locations may
                                                 20
                   DRAFT Recovery Strategy for the Jefferson Salamander in Ontario
need to be conducted for up to three years to ensure adequate effort in investigating
presence. In the case of historic locations, a minimum of three consecutive years of
negative surveys must be conducted to confirm the extirpation of A. jeffersonianum from
that specific historic site. Breeding habitat typically does not support fish which are
capable of eating the eggs or larvae of A. jeffersonianum.
Terrestrial Habitat
The terrestrial component of A. jeffersonianum habitat consists of woodlands, upland
forests, swamps, successional areas, meadows, old fields, agricultural fields and other
vegetated areas that provide conditions required for foraging, dispersal, migration,
growth and hibernation. Terrestrial habitat includes all of the areas and features
described above that extend radially 300 m from the edge of the breeding pond. The
300 m distance is based on the findings of telemetry studies (Bériault 2005, OMNR
2008 unpublished data) and is calculated as the habitat area utilized by 90% of the adult
population for each breeding location based on the movements of tracked individuals.
Terrestrial habitat that meets these requirements should be included within the habitat
regulation.
Corridors that provide contiguous connections between breeding locations can extend
up to a maximum 1 km and should also be included within the habitat regulation. Non-
vegetated open areas such as agricultural fields may be used as migratory corridors
between the breeding pond and forested areas.
Exclusions
The following features should not be included within the habitat regulation:
    • Existing houses, buildings, structures and quarries (and other pre-existing
       industrial land uses) that are within 300 m of a breeding pond.
    • Major roads within 300 m of a breeding pond which present barriers to migration
       and dispersion (e.g. highways).
    • Open areas such as agricultural fields that are within 300m of a breeding pond
       but which do not directly separate breeding ponds from forested areas and
       therefore do not serve as corridors between habitats and /or breeding areas.
Newly Discovered Occurrences
New occurrences for A. jeffersonianum are anticipated. For the purposes of
investigating the presence of A. jeffersonianum at previously un-surveyed locations,
appropriate surveys for up to 3 consecutive years may be required in order to document
the presence of A. jeffersonianum. This reflects intermittent breeding success
associated with variable conditions.
Any newly discovered breeding locations and associated terrestrial habitat as well as
extirpated and historical locations where suitable habitat remains should also be
included within the regulation.

                    DRAFT Recovery Strategy for the Jefferson Salamander in Ontario
Human Created Features
A. jeffersonianum occasionally breed in old farm ponds and human-made depressions
that have reached a substantial state of wetland succession (likely decades) and which
occur within or in close proximity to existing forested or other naturally vegetated areas.
Most of these ponds/depressions occur in locations where wetlands had originally
existed or where portions of wetlands have been deepened. The vast majority of
wetlands on the landscape that existed before agricultural conversion have been
eliminated, and therefore some naturalized human-made depressions are used by A.
jeffersonianum as breeding habitat and should be included within the habitat regulation.
Artificial Habitat Creation/Rehabilitation
At present there is no basis for protection of newly created features (e.g., breeding
ponds) within a habitat regulation because colonization and use of such features has
not been sufficiently documented. Created habitat cannot immediately replace existing
habitat utilized by A. jeffersonianum.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS
Extant populations: Populations that have been confirmed within the last 20 years.
Historic Populations: Populations that have not been confirmed in the last 20 years but
       are not yet confirmed as extirpated.
Control site: A study site against which all other study sites will be compared; where
       conditions are known to be ‘typical’ for A. jeffersonianum and where there is a
       lack of disturbance.
Element Occurrence: A term used by Conservation Data Centres and NatureServe that
       refers to an occurrence of an element of biodiversity on the landscape; an area of
       land and/or water on/in which an element (e.g., species or ecological community)
       is or was present. For A. jeffersonianum Ontario’s Natural Heritage Information
       Centre (NHIC) uses a 1 km radius to define element occurrences.
Polyploidy: More than two sets of chromosomes (e.g., triploid – three sets of
       chromosomes, tetraploid – four sets of chromosomes, etc.).
Snout to Vent Length (SVL): A standard measurement of body length. The
       measurement is from the tip of the nose (snout) to the cloaca (vent), and
       excludes the tail.
Vernal Pools: Also known as ephemeral wetlands, are landform depressions that
        temporarily fill with water following heavy rainfalls, snowmelt in the spring, or as
        a result of a high water table. Vernal pools vary in their size, shape, depth,
        timing and duration of flooding, and the types of species that are able to use
        them. A defining feature of vernal pools is that they usually dry up by the middle
        of the summer; however, some vernal pools may only dry up every couple of
        years.

Hamilton experienced nine safety incidents on its major oil and gas pipelines in just
over a decade, second in Ontario only to the 10 recorded in Sarnia.
The Hamilton cases are part of a nationwide swell in the number of safety­related
incidents on pipelines regulated by the federal government, a CBC News
investigation shows.

National Energy Board documents obtained by CBC News under access to
information laws reveal that across Canada, the rate of safety incidents on pipelines
has doubled since 2000.

By 2011, safety­related incidents — covering everything from unintentional fires to
spills into creeks — rose from one to two for every 1,000 kilometres of federally
regulated pipeline. That reflects an increase from 45 total incidents in 2000 to 142 in
2011.
The information is contained in an NEB database with detailed information about
1,047 pipeline safety incidents from Jan. 1, 2000 until late 2012.
In recent months, a spate of oil and gas spills both from train derailments and
pipelines have raised questions about which mode of transport is the safest.
      'You’re going to get corrosion. You’re going to get incidents. You’re going
     to get failures. Thank God they’re small, but it only takes one catastrophic
     one to change the environment completely.' ­ Guy Paparella, director of
     growth planning for the city of Hamilton
The pipeline industry has touted its safety record as it seeks support for numerous
controversial projects across the continent, including TransCanada’s Keystone XL to
the U.S. Gulf Coast and Enbridge’s Northern Gateway to the B.C. coast, and closer
to home, the Line 9 flow reversal.
In internal documents, the NEB has expressed concerns about the rising rate of
incidents.
Hamilton incidents
 Safety­related incidents on Hamilton oil and gas pipelines (see bottom of page
for a more detailed summary):
     September­October 2001 — 95,000 litres of crude oil from Enbridge pipeline
     leaks in Binbrook
     October 2001 — Small fire during cleanup of Binbrook spill
     December 2005 — Gas leak at Ancaster TransCanada station lasts for 45
     minutes
     May 2007 — Machinery explosion at Ancaster TransCanada station
     November 2007 — Tractor fire on Enbridge pipeline right­of­way
     April 2009 — Broken pipe discovered on filter at TransCanada station
     April 2010 — 100,000 litres of natural gas leaks from TransCanada station in
     Ancaster
     May 2011 — Small fire at TransCanada’s Hamilton Gate Sales Meter Station
     February 2012 — Backhoe strikes, dents TransCanada pipeline

Most of the Hamilton cases were minor, but two resulted in significant discharges of
oil or gas.
 In 2001, Enbridge’s Line 10 pipeline leaked 95,000 litres of crude oil onto a
farmer’s field in Binbrook. And in 2010, a faulty valve on a TransCanada pipeline in
Ancaster caused 100 cubic metres (or 100,000 litres) of natural gas to escape into
the atmosphere.
Lynda Lukasik, executive director of Environment Hamilton, a non­profit advocacy
group, said she’s alarmed that Hamilton nearly topped the list of safety incidents on
pipelines in Ontario.
“We don’t have refineries, we don’t have that concentrated a level of [oil industry]
activities,” she told CBC Hamilton. “So the fact that we have that many incidents
here makes me feel a bit concerned.”
However, Guy Paparella, the city’s director of growth planning, who also oversees a
newly minted city hall task force that examines pipeline proposals, said the figures
don’t come as a shock given the number of pipelines that run through the area.
“Based on where Hamilton is located, we have quite a number of pipelines,” he
said. “We’re at the confluence of Lake Ontario and Lake Erie. And if you want to go
east, west, north and south from this area with a pipeline, you have to go through
Hamilton.”
He said the age of Hamilton’s large oil and gas pipelines may also explain the
number of incidents the city has experienced.
“You’re looking that stuff that’s decades old — 37, 38 years old, in some cases.
You’re going to get corrosion. You’re going to get incidents. You’re going to get
failures. Thank God they’re small, but it only takes one catastrophic one to change
the environment completely.”
The Line 9 Enbridge pipeline is 38 years old.
'Industry­wide commitment'
Pipeline watchers like Pembina Institute associate Nathan Lemphers suggest the rise
may be a worrisome sign of aging infrastructure.
 “The pipelines that are in the ground are getting older and in some cases there's
more products flowing through them so you're going to see increasing incidents and
increasing defects in those pipelines unless they're properly maintained,” Lemphers
said.
      'The Canadian pipeline industry is one of the very safest in the
      world, second to none in terms of actual results.' ­ Brenda Kenny, president
      of the Canadian Energy Pipelines Association
Industry officials defend their safety records, and say they have sophisticated
safeguards in place to prevent catastrophic spills and explosions, and to minimize
the impact of accidents when they do occur.
Brenda Kenny, president of the Canadian Energy Pipelines Association, which
represents major oil and gas companies, says there’s an industry­wide commitment
to “get to zero incidents.”
“We're driving that out very hard through our risk­based management approach at
the industry level that involves a lot of best practices, integrity, management,
technology and these indicators,” she told CBC News.
“The Canadian pipeline industry is one of the very safest in the world, second to
none in terms of actual results.”
Line 9 controversy
The documents come to light amid contentious public debate over a new proposal
put forward by energy giant Enbridge Inc. to make changes to its Line 9 pipeline,
which runs through the Hamilton area.
The Edmonton­based energy giant has applied to the NEB to reverse the flow on a
segment of the pipeline that runs between North Westover, a village near Hamilton’s
northwestern fringe, to Montreal, and also increase the amount of oil running
through the pipeline to 300,000 barrels per day, up from 240,000.
      Related: Line 9 neighbours say Enbridge has been 'good' to them
 The larger volume, Lukasik said, as well as the increasing number of pipeline
incidents across Canada, bodes badly for the safety of the local environment.
“I don’t like the sounds of it,” she said of the number of incidents Hamilton has seen
since 2000, “even if they aren’t major.”
“Add to that this desire for companies like Enbridge to run [diluted oil sands
bitumen] through the lines, that just increases the level of concern even more of
what we might be dealing with.”
Leaks, spills triple
The NEB oversees any pipeline that crosses provincial or international borders,
which includes nearly 90 companies that own about 71,000 kilometres of pipelines.
The data does not include smaller pipelines monitored by provinces.
The federal regulator attributes the rise in incidents to a heightened awareness
among companies about what they need to report.
“We’ve been out there talking with industry associations and the companies
themselves to ensure that they are fully aware of what the reporting requirements
are and I think that’s why we’re seeing an increase right now,” said NEB’s business
leader for operations, Patrick Smythe.

Each company overseen by the NEB must report safety issues including the death or
serious injury of a worker, fires, explosions, liquid product spills over 1,500 litres
and every gas leak.
Among the other findings based on NEB’s pipeline database is that there’s been a
three­fold increase in the rate of spills and leaks — ranging from small amounts to
large — in the past decade.
More than four reportable releases happened for every 10,000 kilometres in 2000, or
18 incidents in total, according to NEB data. By 2011, that rate had risen to 13 per
 10,000 kilometres, or 94 incidents.
Those numbers include any oil or natural gas releases companies are required to
report due to laws.
NEB’s Smythe says that the regulator has not seen an alarming increase in the
“significant, serious or major incidents over the last little while.”
NEB Concerns
Recent documents published by the NEB shows the board has expressed some
concern over rising numbers.
“Notwithstanding the safety record of NEB­regulated pipelines, the board has
noticed an increased trend in the number and severity of incidents being reported by
NEB­regulated companies in recent years,” one 2012 report states.
A 2011 document citing the same concern also notes the need for NEB to “enhance
data collection” in order to tackle that problem and other troubling trends in the
industry.

It goes on to say that a reduction in the numbers ultimately “depends on actions
taken by the industry.”
Carl Weimer, executive director of U.S. advocacy group Pipeline Safety Trust, says
small leaks may not individually be significant on their own, but taken together they
provide a better picture when looking at safety trends.
“It shows how really carefully they are taking care of the pipelines,” said Weimer.
Safety­related pipeline incidents in Hamilton from 2000­2012
     September­October 2001 — 95,000 litres of crude oil spills into a farmer’s
     field after a leak on Enbridge’s Line 10 pipeline.
     October 2001 — During the cleanup from the Binbrook leak, the blade of a
      bulldozer strikes a rock, creating a spark that goes onto ignite some of the
     spilled oil. The flames were put out with a fire extinguisher.
     December 2005 — A faulty valve at an Ancaster station on a TransCanada
     pipeline causes natural gas to leak into the air for 45 minutes.
     May 2007 — While crews were doing repairs on TransCanada’s Ancaster
     Compressor Station, a pressure regulator blew up. The shrapnel damaged other
     equipment, but no one was injured and no gas was released.
     November 2007 — A small tractor, operated by a driver contracted by
     Enbridge, catches fire while working on a tract of land that three of the
     company’s pipeline’s cross. The flames scorch 300 square feet of land. No one
     is injured and no oil is released.
     April 2009 — Workers discover a broken steel pipe on a filter on a
     TransCanada natural gas pipeline.
     April 2010 — A faulty valve on a TransCanada’s Ancaster Compressor Station
     causes 100,000 litres of natural gas to escape into the atmosphere.
     May 2011 —A small fire emanates from a pipe at TransCanada’s Hamilton
     Gate Sales Meter Station. It was quickly extinguished, and no one was injured.
     February 2012 — A backhoe accidentally strikes a TransCanada pipeline
     running through Hamilton, causing a dent about 15 cm long, 14 cm wide and 6
     cm deep. No gas escaped, and the pipe was reinforced.

Hearing Order 0H-001-2016 re; Enbridge Pipelines Inc.
Line 10 Westover Segment Replacement Project
Re: Letter of Comment by Louisette Lanteigne
700 Star Flower Ave. Waterloo Ont. N2V 2L2
Affidavit of Louisette Lanteigne
I Louisette Lanteigne of the City of Waterloo in the Region of Waterloo in Ontario
MAKE OATH AND SAY:
1. I am a resident of Waterloo Ontario. I am a Mi'kmaq Acadian Metis water
advocate who has been actively involved with protection of the environment since
2002 as a concerned citizen. I have years of experience raising concerns using
public processes afforded to me by local, provincial and federal governments to
help protect communities, water supplies, prevent pollution and to protect habitats
of endangered species.
2. I have initiated an Ontario Municipal Board process and secured concessions to
protect water supplies and Jefferson Salamander habitat with OMB appeal PL071044.
I have secured concessions with Part II order requests for Hidden Valley in
Kitchener Ontario and Barrie’s Lake in Cambridge Ontario to protect municipal
groundwater and endangered species habitats, including Jefferson Salamanders, at
these locations. It is reasonable to state I have direct experience in advocating
for the protection of Jefferson salamanders in Ontario.
3. I initiated an Environmental Bill of Rights review for a Waterloo Moraine Act in
2006 which secured an Ontario Ministry of Environment report about the state of
current knowledge for both the Waterloo Moraine and Galt Paris Moraine systems. The
findings have relevance to the lands where Line 10 crosses.
4. As a result of the successful advocacy, I was the subject of several master's
thesis at the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier and have been a guest
speaker at various universities and public events discussing effective
environmental advocacy and source water protection issues. My work stored in the
Archives of Wilfrid Laurier University.
Regarding Jefferson Salamanders:
5. I observed that Jefferson salamanders are located along the route of Enbridge
Line 10 as confirmed by the mapping in the Jefferson Salamander Recovery Strategy.
See Attachment 1, page 15 of the PDF document/page 7 of the report as seen in the
illustration titled Figure 2. Documented Locations of Ambystoma jeffersonianum in
Ontario. .
6. I observed that Jefferson Salamanders in proximity to Line 10 are confirmed in
mapping created by the Ontario Natural Heritage Information Centre as of February
29, 2012. See Attachment 2.

screenshot I took from Earthquaketrack.com of this event. The Earthquake was
measured at 1.8, and was located 14 km south of St. Catherine’s Ontario in Lake
Ontario in an area that appears to be along the Hamilton-Presqu'ile fault as seen
in Attachment 1? on page 56-57.
Regarding Engineering and compliance issues
56. Attachment 2? is the document Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line 11 westover Segment
Replacement Project's Leave to Open Application January 28, 2015. In this report it
states on page 8 Table 3-2: Fitting Test Summary, that the fittings used are
manufactured by Ezeflow.
57. The NEB issued warnings about substandard EZFlow and Canadoil Asia fittings as
seen in Attachment 28. If the flawed fittings are on Line 10, Line 11 or Westover I
would like to secure their removal as a condition of approval.
58. A news article titled Enbridge pumping stations not up to code: NEB By Vincent
McDermott was published on April 8, 2013 in Fort McMurray Today. See Attachment 29.
The article states on page one the following;
The National Energy Board is warning Calgary based Enbridge Inc. that 118 .
pumping stations do not meet federal safety standards and the company has
until April 15 to create a corrective action plan.
According to government documents, inspectors from the federal government
inspected pipeline terminals in Edmonton, westover and Sarnia in 2011,
Investigators discovered insufficient emergency shutdown systems and
emergency backup power generators in the event of an accident.
Pumping Stations provide power to move liquids such as crude oil or diluted
bitumen through a pipeline network.
As a response Enbridge promised to address the problem by October 12 2012.
When the deadline approached, however, the company set the NEB a letter
stating it needed more time to develop an appropriate action plan. In a
letter dated March 15, the company was granted more time to develop an
appropriate action plan. In a letter dated March 15, the company was granted
an extension to April 15.
59. Has the Applicant finished installing their backup power generators? Have they
completed the work to make sure their emergency shutdown systems are fully
functional and compliant at Westover? If not make it a condition of approval.
60. The Hamilton Spectator published an article titled Enbridge missing two key
permits for westover site written by Joan Walters published July 24, 2013. See
Attachment 30 half way down page one, it states:
Enbridge Pipeline Inc. - the company responsible for the largest onshore oil
spill in the United States history — has been told by Ontario regulators it
is missing two key environmental permits at it's Flamborough operation.
Ontario's Ministry of the Environment has ordered the we$tover site - main
pumping station for the company's controversial Line QB — to obtain permits
for air emissions and storm water discharge, a procedure Enbridge says it has
already started.
10

61. Has the Applicant completed the permit applications for air emissions and storm
water drainage for the Westover site? If not, make it a condition of approval.
62. CBC Hamilton published a special report titled Hamilton second in Ontario in
Pipeline Safety Incidents by Cory Ruf and Amber Hildebrandt of CBC News published
October 28, 2013. The article states in Attachment 31 first paragraph:
Hamilton experienced nine safety incidents on its major oil and gas pipelines
in just over a decade, second in Ontario only to the 10 recorded in Sarnia.
63. Attachment 30 lists pipeline incidents in Hamilton from 2000 to 2012 on the
last page and it reads as follows:
Safety—related pipeline incidents in Hamilton from 2000-2012 '
°September-00tober 2001 — 95,000 litres of crude oil spills into a farmer’s
field after a leak on Enbridge’s Line 10 pipeline.

64. Attachment 32 is Transportation and Safety Board of Canada's Pipeline
Investigation Report P01H0049 Crude Oil Pipeline Rupture, Enbridge Pipeline Inc.
508-Millimeter Line 10, Mile post 1885.64 near Binbrook Ontario 29 September 2001.
11

65. Attachment 32 page 6 of the PDF/5 0f the report it states;
Findings as to Causes and Contributing Factors
1. The tape coating disbonded in the vicinity of the failure, possibly
exacerbated by the presence of wooden skids under the pipe.
2. The disbanded coating shielded the pipe from the cathodic protection
current and allowed a corrosive environment to contact the pipe metal.
3. In 1990, the corrosion defect at MP 1885.64 was probably 40 to 45 per cent
through wall but was not identified in the 1990 in-line inspection (ILI)
vendor’s final report and was therefbre not repaired at the time.
4. During the subsequent 11 years, corrosion continued until the wall had
thinned to 16 per cent of its original thickness and the pipe wall could no
longer support the stresses associated with the internal operating pressure.
5. Because Enbridge had not fully appreciated the effect of echo loss in
interpreting metal loss due to external corrosion, Enbridge did not select
the failure site fOJlowing the 2000 metal loss ILI as one requiring immediate
attention.
Findings as to Risk
1. A better understanding is needed by the pipeline industry of the effect
that echo loss has on wall thickness measurements for internal corrosion with
sedimentation and deep external corrosion.
Other Findings
1. The programmable logic controller communications failure at Tanawanda did
not contribute to the rupture at MP 1885.64 but did make it impossible for
the control centre operator to know the status of that station during the
initial response to the leak situation.
66. Why was a pipe installed with a wooden skid underneath? Is there a geological
reason why structural support may have been needed for the pipe in this area and
how secure are the remaining lines in this zone currently?
67. Why is ILI still considered a reliable way to test the pipe when issues such as
external corrosion are being missed even to a depth of 40-45%? Does ILI have the
ability to spot cracks and crack cluster 0n the outside of the line or can it view
the current condition of the welding on this old pipe? How do we check for those
kinds of issues?
68. Has the communications system at Tonawanda been replaced with a fully
functional system of communication with the Edmonton control centre? If not make
it a condition of approval.

69. The Applicant has a website specific to the Line 10 project in Attachment 33.
It states in the 7“ paragraph:
12

Our regulatory application will include a detailed plan to decommission the
segment of Line 10 that’s to be replaced, leaving the pipe in the ground. A
decommissioned line is one that is taken out of service safely and
permanently, but left in place while other pipelines in the same right-of—way
continue to operate.
Leaving this segment of pipe in place is the safest and least disruptive
option at our disposal — it means no additional disturbance from excavation
and removal activities and less risk of future soil and slope instability,
settlement and compaction issues that could compromise the safety of active
pipelines sharing the right-of-way. Independent engineering research
demonstrates that decommissioned pipelines have a very long life as load-
bearing structures for supporting soil and surface loads.
70. The Applicant's website as seen in Attachment 33 shows no mention of the word
pipeline abandonment. They reference the term decommission.
71. There is no mention of the term decommission in the NEB Act. The NEB Act uses
the term pipeline abandonment which fits the description of what Enbridge is trying
to do with sections of Line 10.
72. On August the 4m, 2016 I drove to Copetown, where Hwy 52 meets Governors Road.
I went to the area of the Hydro corridor just to the west of the intersection along
Governor's Rd. I then traveled north to look at all the points where high pressure
oil and gas pipelines cross the area. I wanted to understand the land and how
people behave currently in proximity to the pipe that is to be abandoned. See
Attachment 34.
73. In Attachment 34 page 1 you will see an area where two high pressure natural
gas lines sit directly adjacent to a high pressure oil pipeline, and based on the
markers above the ground, they are all located side by side all within a five to 6
foot width. I believe this oil pipe is Line 10.
74. In my view, it would be costly to remove the oil pipe as seen in Attachment 34
page 1 without disrupting the support for the two TransCanada gas lines that are
directly next to it but leaving this pipe in place does not negate the risks. Here .
are some of the risks I identified at this point:
1. Corrosion of the exterior of the decommissioned oil line can lead to
flakes of metal being released that could scrape or wearing against the gas
lines.
2.With farming and Highways directly over the line, the aging oil pipeline
could collapse altering the support for the two gas lines in a sudden _
uncontrolled manner causing leaks or rupture.
3.Because this area is crossing recharge, heavy flooding could erode
structural support for any one these lines augmenting the support for the
other two.
4. If there is a leak or spill happening at this point, extraction with heavy
machinery could scrape against metal fragments of the aging oil pipe causing
13

a spark and risk of fire or explosion.
75 In my view it would be safer to remove the old pipe in a controlled manner and
replace the sediment around the pipe with clean fill free of metal shards to help
protect those two remaining gas lines.
76. I witnessed farming activity with heavy machinery and saw corn and soy crops
planted on top of the high pressure oil and gas lines as seen in Attachment 34
pages 4, 8 and 10 and the placement of fence posts, trees and a man made pond with
fountain over top of high pressure oil and gas lines in pages 5 and 9 to show that
the call before you dig program might not always work.
77. The call before you dig phone number I witnessed on high pressure oil pipeline
signs that had the word Enbridge on it, states the call before you dig phone number
' is 1-800-400-2255 which is very good because it is linked to the centralized system
being used in Ontario to provide comprehensive data on where it is safe to dig. I
want to thank Enbridge for that because this centralized number is a great idea to
improve safety for everybody while reducing overall costs for companies.
78. The signs for the Sarnia Products High Pressure Pipelines stated the call
before you dig number is is 1-888—242-6660 so I called that number and got Sarnia _
Products Pipeline's automated answer system but it did not state the term ”call
before you dig" among the choices of extensions to select. That may confuse some
people. They did say press 1 for the term "pipeline locates" so I pressed it and
got an answering machine response to leave a message because the person was not
there. So I hung up and tried again and sought assistance. I asked the operator if
their company's information is included with Ontario's centralized call before you
dig and they said yes.
79. I would like the board to issue an order that mandates that all new signs
along the right of way display the Ontario centralized call before you dig phone
number because consistency means safety. It is easier to secure the desired public
behavior with one single number. The safety of all the pipes sharing the same right
of way improves when there is consistency with that number.
80. The high pressure gas lines of TransCanada that I saw in Attachment 34 states
call before you dig but did not provide any phone number specific for that purpose
so I would this hearing to facilitate the placement of that Ontario call before you
dig number on their signs.
81. We need to secure review of the signs and their placement to make sure they are
viable and not blocked with phragmites, trees or other things that can block their
view otherwise they will not serve the function for which they were designed. They
are there to warn people but it will not do the job unless they can seen. See
Attachment 34 page 3.
82. I noticed that signs produced by TransCanada were the only bilingual ones I saw
in the Right of Way area. All the Enbridge and Sarnia Products Pipeline signs along
with E530 and Imperial Oil were in English. I observed a sign near the valves off
Hwy that indicate the presence of sealed radioactive Cesium 137 written in English
but with only one single French word which was Rayonnement which means radiation.
It is reasonable to state it would not inform a French speaking person the same way
as it informs an English person. Why isn't it bilingual?
14

83. Here is a photo of the radioactive sign that I saw at the location of the
manual valves off Hwy 8 in Hydro Corridor in the Copetown area. It shows the lack
of French words to inform of the risks.

84. Attachment 34 pages 11 and 12 I witnessed a manual valve system for High
Pressure oil pipeline off Hwy 8 in the Hydro Corridor around Copetown and noticed =
there was no lighting, generator or visible electrical outlets in the area nor was
there any security systems to prevent tampering other than a chain link fence and
chain around the valves. There was no building for this unit, no video or
surveillance system or fire extinguisher or fire hydrant that I could see within
this area. I saw a very small satellite dish but I don't know it's function and I
don't know if it is hooked up to anything.
85. Attachment 34 page 6 and 7 are photos of a monitoring device for corrosion
placed near a large tree by a high pressure oil pipeline that I witnessed. I took
the photo to get the name on the testing device.
86. The next day as I zoomed in to view the photo, I noticed one of the plugs did
not appear properly plugged in. The other plug appears to have some exposed wire at .
the base. Based on the photos it also appeared the screws on the machine may be
mismatched but it could be due to the lighting of the photo. Either way it would be
good for monitoring systems to go through periodic inspections to make sure they
are still in good working order. I don't know if it is a policy or not but if it
isn't I'd like to recommend it. See Attachment 34 page 5, 6 and 7.
15

Change of ownership and avoidance of mentioning registered corporate names
87. I did a Google search for Sarnia Products Pipeline to read about this company
and that is when I saw the corporate name Imperial Oil Ltd Sarnia Products Pipe
Line. If you view Attachment 34 pages 1,2,3,4 and 10 you will not see clear use of
the words Imperial Oil Ltd. We need the legal names of the registered companies who
own these pipes posted clearly on the signs so people know who owns them. Logos and
brand names are products of a company whereas registered names are identities of
the actual owners. It's important we do not mix the two up.
88. Enbridge Pipeline Inc. completed the sale of assets, including Enbridge Line 10
pipeline, to Enbridge Income Fund Holdings Inc. on September 1, 2015 as announced
on the website for Enbridge Income Fund Holdings Inc. See Attachment 35.
89. Enbridge Income Fund Holdings Inc. website confirms the fact that Line 10 oil
pipeline is an assets they own. See Attachment 36. It states this fact under the -
category Assets:
ENF’s business is limited to investment and ownership of Enbridge Income Fund
(the Fund), which in turn owns the fbllowing high-quality energy
infrastructure assets.

The website then identifies Line 10 among the asset via mapping and related links.
90. The Enbridge Income Fund Holdings Inc. website features a Frequently Asked
Questions page as seen in Attachment 37. It states:

When was ENF created?
ENF was incorporated on March 22, 2010 and began trading on the TSX in
December 2010 fallowing the restructuring of the Fund.
91. On the National Energy Board website for the Line 10 Westover Segment
Replacement, the company name identified with this project is Enbridge Pipeline
Inc. without mention to Enbridge Income Fund Holdings Inc. See Attachment 38.
92. All NEB regulatory documents regarding this pipeline hearing are being stored
under the name Enbridge Pipeline Inc. See Attachment 39.
93. Enbridge Inc. explains it's relationship to Enbridge Income Fund Holdings Inc.
in Attachment 40 taken from the website for Enbridge Income Fund Holdings Inc. It
states the following:
Enbridge holds approximately 90% economic interest in Enbridge Income Fund
(the Fund) directly through it's investments in Enbridge Income Fund Holdings
Inc. and in Fund Units and indirectly through its holdings of EIPLP Class C
units, ECT preferred units, and Enbridge Income Fund Holdings Inc. (ENF)
common shares.
94. On the Enbridge Income Fund Holdings Ltd. website it has 8 section called
Investor Information Kit and by clicking current investment presentation it results
in a Power Point presentation titled: Enbridge Income Fund Holdings Inc. Premier
Energy Infrastructure Investment vehicle July 2016. Attachment 41 page 41 states
16

that Enbridge's total ownership is 86.9%.
95. Enbridge Inc. Board of Directors list is seen in the screen shot in Attachment
42.
96. Enbridge Income Fund Holdings Inc. Board of Directors is in the screen shot in
Attachment 43. Having two separate boards of directors verifies the fact that
Enbridge Inc. and Enbridge Income Fund Holdings Inc. are two separate companies.
97. Attachment 44 is an article titled Why Canadian pipeline companies are moving -
billions in assets to U.S. subsidiaries as written by Geoffrey Morgan published on '
Oct. 2, 2015 in the Financial Post. '
The article states the following in Paragraph 1:
Canadian pipeline companies are moving billions of dollars worth of assets to
their U.S. subsidiaries, a move that allows them to pay less in tax and raise -
more capital for their major projects.
98. Attachment 44 Paragraph 4 states:
Executives at competing midstream company Enbridge Inc. said Tuesday the
company had identified $24-billion in assets that could potentially be
dropped down to its three subsidiaries, or ”sponsored vehicles” as the _
company describes them, in order to finance its own $44-billion capital
program.
”Our sponsored vehicle strategy has arguably been slow to develop,” said
Enbridge senior vice-president, finance John Whelen at the company’s investor
day in Toronto. The company has transferred $4 2-billion worth of assets to
one such subsidiary, Enbridge Income Fund Holdings, since 2011.
In the past two weeks, the parent company has accelerated its drop downs. On
Sept. 17, the parent company announced it had proposed a transfer of its
remaining 66.7% ownership stake in the U.S. segment of its Alberta Clipper
pipeline to subsidiary Enbridge Energy Partners LP for $900-million. Then on
Sept. 22, the company announced it had transferred $1.76-billion worth of
natural gas and diluent pipeline assets to Enbridge Income Fund, another of
the parent company’s subsidiaries.
Both Enbridge Energy Partners and the parent company’s third subsidiary,
Midcoast Energy Partners, are both structured as MLPs.
Rick Whitley, managing partner at accounting firm KPMG’s Calgary office, said
that an MLP is a U.S. corporate structure similar to the income trust model
that was once prevalent in the Canadian energy sector. A 2006 change in tax "
laws eliminated the ability of income trusts to pay pre-tax dividends to unit
holders. '
17

99. Based on my personal observations, this article clarifies the fact that parent
company Enbridge Inc. transferred assets including Line 10, from the ownership of
it's the Canadian based Enbridge Pipeline Inc. to a US company called Enbridge
Income Fund Holdings Inc. specifically to take advantage of economic practices that
are currently prohibited by Canadian law. As seen in Attachment 44 paragraph 1 it
states:
...they did this to pay less taxes.
100. I fail to understand how the sale of assets like Line 10 can reasonably be
deemed in the public interest of Canadians. When aggressive tax avoidance
strategies are implemented it transfers higher fiscal burdens onto Canadian '
taxpayers and when taxpayers have less money to invest with, it hurts the company's
own bottom line. It's a flaw similar to their Intelligent Valve Placement. Their
view of growth is like their view of topography. If a mountain equals growth, they
dig holes and pile up the dirt on the side of the hole thinking they are creating
new mountains when in fact they are burying themselves because they are eroding the -
cash liquidity of the investors who have supported them all these years. That's not
good for business.
101. The NEB Act section 21 states the following:
Review, etc., of decisions and orders
'21 (1) Subject to subsection (2), the Board may review, vary 0r rescind any

104. I asked if there was a Transfer of Assets when Enbridge Income Fund Holdings
Inc. purchased the assets from Enbridge Pipeline Inc. See Attachment 46 for my
communications with Graham White of Enbridge Pipelines (as he typed it) specific to
this issue. Since Mr. White chose to embedded his response into the body of the
email I wrote, I will clarify who wrote what as it relates to the August 20, 2015
email using the initials of our names. LL for Louisette Lanteigne and Gw is for _
Graham White.
LL. Is Enbridge Pipeline Inc. a company? A simple yes or no response please. ,
Is Enbridge Income Fund a company? Again, it is a simple yes or no response
please.
Gw: Yes to both. _

7. I observed that in the Line 11 westover Segment Replacement Project, Enbridge
Responses to NEB IR No. 2 File OF-Fac-Oil-E101-2014-01-01 is specific to Jefferson
Salamanders. Line 11 shares the right of way of Line 10 so this data has relevance.
In Attachment 3 page 1, under Preamble, second paragraph it states the following
passage:
In its evaluation of likelihood of occurrence of species at risk (Reference
ii), Enbridge states that species-specific surveys for Jefferson Salamander
were not conducted but that potential habitat exists in the study area in the
form of deciduous swamps and fresh moist thick canopied forests. Enbridge
further states that impacts to this species are not likely to occur as
potential habitat areas are being avoided. Based on this evaluation, Enbridge
did not carry forward an environmental assessment of Jefferson Salamander.
8. I observed that the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario
(COSSARO) listed Jefferson Salamanders as being Endangered in their final report
dated February 2011. Attachment 4, Page 4 section 6 states:
6. Ontario Decline Threatened. 0f 87 sites from which salamanders of the
Jeffersonianum complex have been recorded, only 33 have been confirmed to
have A. jeffersonianum (JJ) or unisexuals (LJJ) over the past decade. _
Assuming all 33 locations have pure Jefferson Salamanders (JJ), then the
decline over the past three generations (~33 years) is 60%. However, other
samples from ponds known to have pure Jefferson Salamanders suggest the ‘
decline is higher (COSEWIC 2010 in press). Repeat surveys over a 15- year
timeframe (1990-2005) revealed that most populations were declining and some
were extirpated. For example, surveys of 18 historically known breeding sites
along the Niagara Escarpment that were documented in 1990-91 revealed only 3
sites that were confirmed to still be supporting A. jeffersonianum
populations in 2003-04 (COSEWIC 2010, in press), an apparent decline of 83%.
9. I observed that in Attachment 4 section 7 it states:
7. Ontario’s Conservation Responsibility Not in any category. Ontario has
less than 10% of global range, albeit the most interesting 10%
10. There is no information to indicate why Ontario's Jefferson Salamander
population is deemed ”the most interesting 10%".
11. On Attachment 4 page 5 in section 4 it states:
4. Specialized Life History or Habitat-use Characteristics Endangered.
Jefferson Salamanders require temporary, fishless ponds to breed and an
extensive surrounding moist deciduous forest for other activities.
12. I spoke with the The Grand River Conservation Authority (GRCA) about the two
salamanders seen in Attachment 5. They were found by Barrie's Lake in Cambridge
Ontario. Barrie's Lake is known to contain both Jefferson Salamanders and fish as
confirmed to me by the GRCA and in numerous EA reports that I witnessed.
13. Attachment 6 is a photo of Barrie's Lake. The thick grasses and hummocky pond
serves to isolate fish from salamanders within the same shared water body. This
kind of habitat may exists around the area of Line 10 so please secure studies for
salamanders even on ponds with fish in this area.

LL. Does Enbridge Pipeline Inc. have any paperwork to suggest that they
sought NEB permission for the transfer of these assets and ownership of Line
9 to reasonably prove compliance to section 74 of the NEB Act?
Gw: As the NEB already indicated to you, an application fer a transfer of
shares is not required so there is no documentation.
LL. Is there any written infbrmation to verify that the NEB, Municipalities,
Land Owners or First Nation's were reasonably informed of this transfer of
assets?
Gw: Our plans were well publicized with numerous news releases.
httQ://www.enbridge.com/MediaCentre/News.asgx conference calls and supporting
materials, httQ://www.enbridge.com/MediaCentre/News.aspx as well as MD&A and
financial reporting disclosure
httQ://www.enbridge.com/InvestorRelations/Events.asgx -
Our plans were broadly disseminated well in advance of the Enbridge Income
Fund shareholder vote. we will have a full 9 months between when we first
announced our plans and closing, and we've been speaking openly and publicly
about it during that entire time. Further, section 75 of the NEB Act still
applies to Enbridge Pipeline Inc., who owns the facilities, to make full
compensation for any damage sustained as a result of it's activities, nor are
there any affects to civil liabilities.
To be more clear on actual ownership with respect to Line 9, it is owned by
Enbridge Pipelines Inc. both before and after the transaction. There was no
change in direct ownership of this asset. The restructuring was an
optimization of our financial structure and has no impact on our operations.
Enbridge remains the operator and manager of all it's assets and companies
both before and after the transaction. There is no change to our
comprehensive insurance coverage or our emergency response capabilities.
Safety and operational reliability remain our number one priority.
LL. Thank you kindly fer your time.
105. I contacted the National Observer with the concerns I had regarding the lack
of Transfer of Assets and a story on this issue was published on August 20 in an
article written by Fram Dinshaw titled Enbridge Line 9 changing hands. See
Attachment 47.
106. Attachment 47 page 3 fourth paragraph under the term Shell Games? states:
John Quarterly, chair of the Chessmen Media Group, said that corporations
often set up several layers of shell companies that force plaintiffs to sue
through all the different levels, resulting in expensive court cases that can
drag on fbr years. He alleged that such tactics were used by big companies to
divest themselves of any responsibility in the event of disasters like a
major oil spill.
”I do not know how many of you know how the corporations protect themselves
from being sued," said Quarterly in an email to Lanteigne. "They keep setting
up subsidiaries that have shares in the company which they have split off
from."
20

107. Attachment 47, the last three paragraphs state:
But Lanteigne maintained that if the Enbridge Pipeline Inc. and Enbridge
Income Fund were indeed two separate companies, then section 74 of the NEB
Act would have been violated.
”If Enbridge Pipeline Inc. and Enbridge Income Fund are not actually
individual companies because they are both part of Enbridge Inc. as Mr. White
suggests, then it is reasonable to state that all NEB documents that refer to
Enbridge Pipeline Inc. as a company are null and void due to the simple fact
that Enbridge Pipeline Inc. is not a company,” said Lanteigne. "The entire
process was focused on Enbridge Pipeline Inc. as the applicant.”
The National Observer tried contacting Enbridge’s Graham White several times
for more infOrmation, but did not receive a response at time of writing. -
108. I wrote an email to the NEB Chair Peter Watson and here was his response the
lack of transfer of assets concern I voiced.
---—- Forwarded Message ----- From: Peter watson <Peter.watson@neb-one.gc.ca>

please review the Board’s decision in 0H-002-2013. The Board has not taken
the view that corporate name changes require applications under the NEB Act:
see the Board’s letter of 20 April 2015. The Board’s top priorities are the
safety of Canadians and the protection of the environment. As the Board noted
in its 20 April 2015 letter, corporate name changes do not impinge on the
NEB’s effectiveness as a regulator.

Chair and CEO
109. I reviewed the document: Enbridge Pipelines Inc. Line 10 wastover Segment
Replacement Project Section 1 EXecutive Summary. Attachment 48 section 1.1 page 1
states:
1.1. The Applicant -
Enbridge is a body corporate, incorporated under the Canada Business
Corporations Act and is a ”company” within the meaning of the NEB Act.
Enbridge is the owner and operator of the Canadian portion of the Enbridge
Mainline System, which is a common carriage system that transports crude oil
and petroleum products from the hub at Edmonton, Alberta to locations
21

throughout Canada and to the Canada/United States border.
110. Notice how they state the word Enbridge as the Applicant. This document has
negated to provide the full legal name of the company with legal element included
and this is in a section specifically designed to identify the applicant. This is
not reasonable.
111. Attachment 49 is Corporations Canada Introduction to Name Policies website. On
the first page it states:
The rules for the granting of names under the Canada Business Corporations _
Act (CBCA) and the Canada Corporations Act (CCA) are almost the same.
Essentially an applicant cannot have a name that
- lacks distinctiveness
- is likely to cause confusion with other businesses
- is likely to mislead the public '
- is reserved for another business
- is obscene, or
- has an unacceptable French or English form
112. Attachment 49, last page states in section 1.5 Elements of a Corporate Name:
Generally, a corporate name is composed of three elements.
a. A distinctive element which is the unique identifier of the name
b. A descriptive element which describes the line of business (Not absolutely
required)
c. A legal element which indicates the legal status of the corporation as an
incorporated body
Example: Teletext Commercial Communications Ltd.
113. The example of the term Enbridge as seen in Attachment 48 shows how vague the
use of the term Enbridge can be. The passage as written could technically refer to
to Enbridge Pipeline Inc. or the company who acquired the asset, Enbridge Income
Fund Holdings Inc. or to Enbridge Inc. Without the legal element included, it's
hard to tell what they mean.
114. I wrote a letter to the NEB asking them to clarify who the current owner of
the pipe is and Attachment 50 is the written response provided to me about to my
inquiry of Line 10 ownership. File 0F-Fac-0il-E101-2015-09-02 is dated 16 May 2016
and is signed by L. George for Sheri Young Secretary of the National Energy Board.
(Note: I have added bold font to selected areas of this response that I will be
referencing.) It states half way down page 1 of Attachment 50:
. You have requested a copy of transfer of assets specific to Line 10, and
raised several concerns regarding ownership related to Enbridge Income Fund
and Enbridge Pipelines Inc. You have stated that ’mif the ownership of the
22

line has changed it is reasonable to state the current application is with a
firm that no longer owns the pipe and this hearing process is null and void.
That is the issue I want clarity on.”
o The certificate holder fer Line 10 is Enbridge Pipelines Inc. The existing
certificate authorizes the operation of the pipeline. The replacement of Line
10 is subject to Board approval.
0 The applicant for the Line 10 westover Segment Replacement Project is
Enbridge Pipeline Inc. The applicant refers to itself as Enbridge, and
identifies this abbreviated name in its cover letter to the project
application.
0 The Board is aware that Enbridge conducted a restructuring and transferred
assets to the Enbridge Income Fund. Enbridge is not required to seek
authorization under section 74 of the National Energy Board Act for such a -
restructuring.
For greater clarity, sections 74(1)(a) and (b) are triggered only when there
is a sale, purchase, lease or transfer of physical pipeline assets, rather
than extending to transactions where an interest in the company (direct or
indirect), as opposed to pipeline assets, is transferred.
115. The NEB has clarified in Attachment 50 that Enbridge Pipeline Inc. filed the
application for Line 10 and they are the certificate holder for Line 10.
116. NEB stated in Attachment 50 that:
The applicant for the Line 10 westover Segment Replacement Project is
Enbridge Pipeline Inc. The applicant refers to itself as Enbridge, and
identifies this abbreviated name in its cover letter.
Based on that response it is my understanding that Enbridge Pipeline Inc. is
responsible for using the abbreviated term ”Enbridge” which in my view can easily
be mixed up for Enbridge Inc. or Enbridge Income Funds Holdings Inc. Using the term
Enbridge lacks regard for the distinctiveness of corporate names and causes
confusion with other businesses. The Canada Business Corporations Act (CBCA) and
the Canada Corporations Act (CCA) name policies were designed specifically to
prevent these kind of issues. Why is this not standard practice at the NEB to
always reference the full legal names?
117. Attachment 50 states:
The Board is aware that Enbridge conducted a restructuring and transferred
assets to the Enbridge Income Fund. Enbridge is not required to seek
authorization under 74 of the National Energy Board Act for such '
restructuring.
Because the NEB are not using full legal corporate names, the same phrase could be
interpreted differently based on the assumption of the reader. I will give three
examples to show how the same phrase can be interpreted differently. For example:
1. If the NEB is referring to Enbridge Inc. as the term Enbridge it is
23

reasonable to state that authorization under section 74 does not apply
because The applicant is Enbridge Pipeline Inc. who owns the certificate for
Line 10 not Enbridge Inc.
2. If the NEB is referring to Enbridge Pipeline Inc. as Enbridge, then it
raises concern because Enbridge Pipeline Inc. transferred assets without
using NEB Act section 74 as confirmed by both Graham White and NEB Board
Chair Peter Watson yet at this time, Enbridge Income Fund Inc. is already
claiming ownership of Line 10 on their corporate website in Attachment 36.
3. This example requires more effort to explain than the first two. See
Attachment 41 slide 2 of Enbridge Income Fund Holdings Inc. Premier Energy
Infrastructure Investment vehicle July 2016. The first paragraph states:
This presentation includes certain forward looking statements and
infbrmation (”FLI”) to provide Enbridge Income Fund Holdings Inc.
(”EIFH”) shareholders and potential investors with information about -
EIFH and its investee, Enbridge Income Fund (the ”Fund”), management's
assessment of their future plans and operations, which may not be
appropriate for other purposes.
Based on that passage, Enbridge Income Fund Holdings Inc. is a company and
Enbridge Income Fund is an investee. They are identified as two separate
things but the only difference between the two names is the use of the legal
term Inc. It is so subtle a difference that the staff at Enbridge Income Fund
Holdings Inc. had to create new acronyms to distinguish the names for their
investors. Enbridge Income Fund Holdings Inc. is given the term EIFH.
Enbridge Income Fund is referred to as ”the Fund" in this report.
Transferring assets from one COMPANY TO ANOTHER without regard for sections
21, and 74 of the NEB Act would violate the NEB Act.
Now read this passage, once more and mentally insert the world Inc. after the
term Enbridge Income Fund.
The Board is aware that Enbridge conducted a restructuring and transferred
assets to the Enbridge Income Fund. Enbridge is not required to seek
authorization under 74 of the National Energy Board Act fer such
restructuring.
If the Board was aware that Enbridge Pipeline Inc. transferred assets to
Enbridge Income Fund Inc. This phrase could mean they admit to an act that
violated the NEB Act or it could be indicating that discretionary powers at
the Government level has somehow negated the need for compliance to those
policies.
The NEB are using words like Enbridge and Enbridge Income Fund, without the
use of legal aspect so it is very difficult to understand what that phrase
actually means.
118. Based on the response I received I still do not know what legally registered
company currently owns Line 10 pipeline currently.
24

119. There are rules for the granting of names under the Canada Business
Corporations Act (CBCA) and the Canada Corporations Act (CCA) yet the National
Energy Board and the Applicant and it's affiliates repeatedly use discretionary
powers to avoid using full legal corporate names in applications, on websites and
regulatory documents. This is resulting in the kinds of issues that these laws were
designed to prevent.
120. The concerns that I wrote of section 87, page 16 of this Affidavit the same
issue applies to the signs I saw when I did the site visit. They often do not
contain the legally registered corporate names of the company who owns them.
121. A company must be legally registered with a legal corporate name to do
business. That business has the right to create logos and a brand to help market
themselves, but the concept of a brand name is a product of that a company, it is
NOT the company itself. Brand names should never be used to replace the function of .
a bona fide registered corporate name for application processes or administrative
information. To do so is fraud. Fraud means false representation by words or by
conduct or by concealment of what should have been disclosed.
122. If we can't keep track of the legal corporate names on paper we should at
least devise a mechanism to do the job for us so there is a clear legal record of
who does what and when it happened, so here is an idea I offer to the Board.
When I go to the bank I use a bank card that clearly identifies who I am as a
person. The bank provides me with that number which I require to complete all
transactions with that bank and it keeps record of my activities.
All companies that requires the services of the NEB should have a properly
registered corporate ID card that can only be issued by the NEB. The card
must clearly identify registered corporate names and we can build a
searchable data history specific to that company. No card can be issued to a
brand name. This secures a means to record transactions are done only with
legal corporate entities that are authorized to do work with the NEB. This
will create a better foundation for planning and it will avoid name mix ups.
Conclusion
123. Based on the evidence I have provided, I do not support leaving Line 10 buried
in the ground nor do I support the installation of a new oil pipe to replace the
current function of Line 10 with expanded capacity.
116. I respectfully request a Federal audit or investigation of the Applicant and
the NEB in regards to their avoidance of disclosing Registered Corporate Names in
regards to the Line 10 Westover Segment Replacement Project and the concerns as _
voiced in this affidavit.

14. The Jefferson Salamander is listed as Endangered in the Species At Risk in
Ontario List, 0 Reg 230/08, under the Act. A description of the habitat of the
Jefferson Salamander is provided in the Regulations General under the Act. It
states the following with specificity to Hamilton:
Jefferson salamander habitat
28. For the purpose of clause (a) of the definition of ”habitat" in
subsection 2 (1) of the Act, the following areas are prescribed as the
habitat of the Jefferson salamander:
1. In the City of Hamilton, the counties of Brant, Dufferin, Elgin, Grey,
Haldimand, Norfolk and Wellington and the regional municipalities of Halton,
Niagara, Peel, Waterloo and York,
1. a wetland, pond or vernal or other temporary pool that is being used by a
Jefferson salamander or Jefferson dominated polyploid or was used by a
Jefferson salamander or Jefferson dominated polyploid at any time during the
previous five years,
ii. an area that is within 300 metres of a wetland, pond or vernal or other
temporary pool described in subparagraph 1 and that provides suitable
foraging, dispersal, migration or hibernation conditions for Jefferson
salamanders or Jefferson dominated polyploids,
iii. a wetland, pond or vernal or other temporary pool that,
A. would provide suitable breeding conditions for Jefferson salamanders or
Jefferson dominated polyploids,
B. is within one kilometre of an area described in subparagraph 1, and
C. is connected to the area described in subparagraph 1 by an area described
in subparagraph iv, and '
iv. an area that provides suitable conditions for Jefferson salamanders or
Jefferson dominated polyploids to disperse and is within one kilometre of an
area described in subparagraph 1. 0. Reg. 436/09, s. 1.
15. I spoke with Senior MNR policy adviser Gail Jackson on October 6, 2011 in a .
telephone conversation in order to better understand the policies to protect
Jefferson Salamanders. Attachment 7 are the notes I took from that conversation. It
states:
3

The Endangered Species Act 2007 applies to any activity that poses an

immediate threat to threatened or endangered species and their habitats.

Projects cannot be ”grandfathered” to avoid it and the most current version

of the law stands.

The Endangered Species Act demands that there must be a net benefit for the

species. If one is killed, they must be replaced by two or more live

specimens per kill and they must expand on the delineated protected habitat

area to assure the improved survival rates of the remaining specimens in the

area.

A single application can take up to 7 years before a permit is issued. It

must be signed three times by various review agencies including MNR staff,

the deputy minister, the MNR ministers and others.

Prior to the issuance of permit the request be posted on the Environmental

Bill of Rights Registry fbr public comment. ALL alternative designs

submitted by city planners, developers and the public can be reviewed at this

phase and the decision that best balances needs of the threatened/endangered

species and planning needs can be implemented. If there is no reasonable way

to secure a net benefit of the species, the request will be denied _
16. To date I have not seen any evidence to suggest that critical habitat mapping
has taken place for any of the known Jefferson Salamander populations along Line 10
nor have I seen any Jefferson Salamander recovery strategies planned or permit
requests listed for this project on the Environmental Registry. In light of these
concerns I respectfully request that such provisions be included as a condition of
approval.
Regarding Geological Risks:
17. In 2006 I initiated an Environmental Bill of Rights review to assess the need
for a Waterloo Moraine Act. It was paired with a similar request submitted by Liz
Sandals in Guelph calling for a review of the Galt-Paris Moriane. The requests
resulted I a single report titled; Review of the State of Knowledge for the
waterloo and Paris/Galt Moraines. It was prepared for: Land and Water Policy Branch
Ministry of the Environment Prepared by: Blackport Hydrogeology Inc. Blackport and
Associates Ltd. and AquaResource Inc. See Attachment 8.
18. Attachment 8 page 8 of the PDF/page 1 of the report in section 1.2 Study
Objectives states:

The primary objective of the overall review, as outlined in the RFR, is to

provide background information on the state of knowledge of the general

physical conditions and hydrologic functions of the Waterloo and Paris/ Galt

Moraines. The objectives of the RFR review are to:

- summarize the state of hydrogeologic knowledge and determine gaps, if any,

which would be required to be filled to enable policy to protect the Waterloo

and Paris/ Galt Moraines;

- provide an overview of current and potential threats and impacts on the

hydrologic functions of the moraines; and,

- review the best management practices and mitigative measures to protect

moraine functions.

A report is to be prepared that will identify if there are information gaps

4

in the current understanding of:
- the groundwater recharge, discharge and storage functions of each moraine;
- the linkage of moraine functions to surface water quality and quantity
functions; and,
. current and potential threats to the moraine functions from urban and
industrial development, aggregate operations, transportation, agriculture,
and climate change.
This background report will be used by the MOE to determine whether these
information gaps are sufficient to impede adequate policy protection of the
moraines.
19. Attachment 8, page 10 of the PDF/page 3 of the report, in 1.3.2 Paris and Galt
Moraines it states Hamilton was within the area of review:
The Paris/ Galt Moraine system extends across the upper tier municipalities
of Peel, Halton, Wellington, Waterloo, Brant and Norfolk and the Cities of
Guelph and Cambridge. It is found within parts of four subwatersheds in the
Credit River watershed (CVC), six subwatersheds in the Grand River Watershed
(GRCA) and several smaller subwatersheds within the jurisdiction of the
Hamilton, Halton and Long Point Conservation Authorities.
20. The report included a review of Climate Change issues in Attachment 8 page 47
of the PDF/ page 40 of the report in section 4.5. The report states:
The following presents a general summary of potential impacts and issues
related to water resources and climate change that could be occur in southern
Ontario:
Surface Water - Water Quantity and Water Supply
-Summer flows are expected to decline, which will impact the assimilative
capacity of the receiving streams or rivers (e.g. the Grand River).
-The magnitude of spring flooding will likely decline, however increased
winter flows will increase the risk of severe flooding in the winter.
-There will be increased property damage due to increased flooding during
both winter/spring melt events and severe summer storms.
21. Knowing the risks of winter flood events I was concerned about the
effectiveness of booms so I read reports on the topic and found a report titled
Advancing Oil Spills Response in Ice Covered waters produced by the Prince William -
Sound Oil Spill Recovery Institute Cordova, Alaska and the United States Arctic
Research Commission Arlington, Virginia and Anchorage, Alaska. 0h Attachment 9 page
13 of the PDF/page 8 of the report it states the following:
Conventional booms will quickly collect ice and subsequently lose oil as the
flotation chambers are submerged or lifted out of the water.
22. In light of that passage I would like to request a spills test in winter to .
assess response times and spills protocols and to examine the effectiveness of
booms and equipment in cold temperatures with icy waters.
23. The state of knowledge of the waterloo and Galt Paris Moraine systems
identified the fact that more data was needed to fully understand the
characteristics and risks for these specific areas so the Environmental Bill of
Rights process helped to identify the data gaps that could now be investigated
5

using the Source Water Protection Act, other policies and further geological
analysis.
24. Attachment 10 is a report titled Buried bedrock valleys and glacial and
subglacial meltwater erosion in Southern Ontario Canada produced by Cunhai Gao of
the Ontario Geological Survey. It features a bedrock valley systems known as the
Dundas Valley that exists from Copetown Ont. to Lake Ontario and chronicles
scientific understanding of the geology of this feature from 1900's to current
knowledge.
25. In Attachment 10/page 10 of the PDF features illustration Fig. 7. Moraines and
eskers in southern Ontario, formed during the Late Wisconsinan. You can see the
Dundas Valley from Capetown to Hamilton.
26. In Attachment 10/page 12 of the PDF features detailed mapping of the Dundas
Valley in the lower photo showing the area between Copetown to Hamilton. The
sediment and waters flowed to Lake Ontario along that line.
27. Attachment 10 Page 16 of the PDF end of the second paragraph states:
The Dundas valley is the westward extension of the Lake Ontario Basin, I
resulting from glacial to subglacial meltwater erosion. This is evidenced by
the valley infill consisting of glacial and related deposits of the
Wisconsinan.
28. Attachment 11 is the results of a Mapquest search for Copetown Ontario. It
shows the intersection of Governors Road and Hwy 52. I include both the Aerial
view and illustrated view as well as a map of Line 10 to show the pipeline's
proximity to the Dundas Valley geological formation. The mark on the map is the
nearest intersection but the pipe is in the Hydro corridor just to the west.
29. Attachment 12 is the original map used for the first approval of the pipeline.
30. Attachment 13 is the Source Water Protection Act mapping illustrating the
vulnerable aquifers around Halton Region and Hamilton Region titled Figure 6.4
Highly Vulnerable Aquifers (HVA). The Westover terminal and portions of Line 10 are
located in areas identified as Highly Vulnerable Aquifers.
31. Attachment 14 is a report titled Spills Scenario Modelling for Lake Ontario
Intakes, Halton-Hamilton Focus prepared by Modelling Surface Water Ltd., 2011. It
served as an Assessment report for five Source Water Protection Areas under the
Clean Water Act including Niagara, Halton-Hamilton, CTC which includes Credit
Valley, Toronto and Region and central Lake Ontario, TCC which is the Trent
Conservation Coalition which includes Ganaraska Region, Otonabee- Peterborough,
Kawartha-Haliburton, Crowe Valley along with Lower Trent as finally, Quinte. The
findings in this report has implications for all these communities.
32. In Attachment 14 page 18 of the PDF/ page 1:3 of the report, section 1.2.6
Lake Hydrodynamics and Heat Exchange identifies that the major force function used
to drive currents in Lake Ontario is wind stress.
6

33. Attachment 14 page 19 of the PDF/page 1-4 of the report illustrates how
contaminates simply do not flow in a linear manner from one end of the lake out the
St. Lawrence but they are subject to currents governed by water temperatures, wind
and the influence of shorelines and depth of water. Some spills if discharged can
travel downstream and loop back in again upstream creating risks for municipal
intakes.
34. Attachment 14 page 99 of the PDF/ page 6-17 of the report Section 6 is
modelling various spills scenarios involving benzene, a chemical found in
petrochemical products. Analysis was done simulating spills around the Hamilton
area to assess how long it would take for a spill to reach various water intakes of
communities along Lake Ontario. It is applicable to this hearing because a spill in
the Capetown area's Dundas Valley would likely send contaminates towards Lake
Ontario.
Regarding Seismic Risks:
35. Earthquaketrack.com is a website where people can do a quick search to review
previous seismic activities of a given area. I did a search for Hamilton Ontario
and found the data as seen in Attachment 15 showing seismic events in proximity to
Enbridge Line 10 and Westover. This is the screen shot of the site when I saw it on
Friday August 5, 2016 and Attachment 16 is the print out version showing the
coordinates of the events using data from the US Geological Survey.
36. Attachment 17 is the report titled OPG's Deep Geologic Repository for Low to
Intermediate Level Waste Seismic Hazard Assessment published on March 2011 Prepared
by: AMEC Geomatrix, Inc. Page 54 of the PDF/page 36 of the report Figure 2.21:
Structural Subdivisions 0f Precambrian Basement with Faults, Aeromagnetic
Lineaments and Lithdtectonic Domain Boundaries illustrates the various fault lines
located in the area of Line 10 and the Westover terminal.
37. Attachment 17 page 42 of the PDF/page 24 of the report shows how areas of the
Central Metasedimentary Belt boundary tectonic zone; MD - Mississauga domain are
located in proximity to Line 10. This fault line was part of the cold-joint
megathurst which helped form the cliffs of the Niagara Escarpment.
38. Attachment 17 on page 56-57 of the PDF/page 38 of the report last paragraph
states:
Structural features that could be possible seismic sources have been
investigated and are incorporated into the seismic hazard analysis for the
Bruce nuclear. These sources, which include the Grenville Front tectonic
zone, Georgian Bay linear zone, Niagara-Pickering linear zone, Clarendon-
Linden fault system and Hamilton-Presqu’ile lineament (Figure 2.22),
described in Section 3.3.
39. Attachment 17 page 57 of the PDF/page 39 of the report, figure 2.22 the .
Hamilton Presqu'ile lineament appears to lines up with the geological feature known
as the Dundas Valley.
7

40. Attachment 18 is a map from the Ontario Geological Survey titled Southern
Ontario Karst which illustrates Karst in proximity to Westover terminal and Line
10. The drumlins of the Paris Galt Moraine are known fer Karst features which are
caves created by the dissolution of soluble rocks like limestone, dolomite and
gypsum.
41. Attachment 19 is information from the US Geological Survey on the risks of
Sinkholes. It shows what happens when Karst collapses. It is a risk to consider in
the area of this pipeline and Westover terminal.
42. In Attachment 11, there is a Google Earth view of the intersection of Governors
road and Hwy 52 in Copetown. There are kettle ponds in proximity to Line 10.
43. I researched the Ontario Geological Survey's Karst Data in GIS format and took
took screen shots of the Westover terminal as seen in Attachment 20. The oil
terminal is sitting on confirmed Karst as indicated in Red, with possible Karst
located in the yellow zones. When you click on the colored fields the image shows
the Google Earth view of what exists in those areas. It confirms the terminal and
pipelines are located on top of Karst.
44. In the report Shake Out Scenario Supplemental Study Oil and Gas Pipelines _
prepared for the USGS and California Geological Survey as written by Dan Ballantyne
I observe on Attachment 21 page 5 of the PDF/page 4 of the report that states:
Historically, steel pipelines with high quality electric are welded joints
perfbrm very well in this shaking environment. Pipelines with joints using
oxyeacetylene welds can have failure rates nearly 100 times greater than
those with electric are welded joints.
45. Seismic activities are not limited to earthquakes alone. It can come from
traffic over a pipeline or farm machinery over a field or quarry pit activities
nearby. It can even come from the flow of bitumen because the mass of the substance
in the pipe is not necessarily uniform due to the varying presence of sediment in
the product. Anything that can shake a pipe can stress welding over time.
46. Understanding the geological characteristics of this area, are welds should be
mandatory for the pipeline and infrastructure at the terminal and pumping stations
too as a precautionary approach.
47. Attachment 22 is a document titled Enbridge's Intelligent valve Placement
system information.
48. In Attachment 22 page 2, the section titled: Single Sided Valley states: *
In this scenario, an isolation valve is placed on the left side of the body
of water. 1 However, on the right side of the body of water,2 oil would drain
downhill away from the body of water, and a valve would provide no isolation
benefit. A valve would be more optimally placed downstream, closer to any
water bodies or H045.
49. The characteristics of Outwash Moraine systems include a water body on one side
followed by a peak and then a long gradual hill slope, not unlike the photo as seen
in the example of a Single Sided Valley.
8

50. In an outwash moriane, The pool of water is where the glacier melted in it's
last stage when it was smaller but the nearby peak represents the edge of the same
glacier when it was very big. As the big glacier melted, it washed off sediment and
water in wave like formations like the ripples you see at a beach along the water's
edge. In an outwash moriane you can do bore hole studies and the slope and it may
appear all clay covered, but with ground penetrating radar it reveals gaps where
water enters into the aquifer. The shingles are not laid out evenly. Sometimes they
are missing. At the Arkell Research Centre in Guelph has a hill slope gathering 7%
of Guelph's groundwater supply. Just because it's a slope doesn't mean it's not
primary recharge. See Attachment 23.
51. Beyond the scope of basic topography, Enbridge's Intelligent valve Placement
appears to have no regard for geology, sediment types or the glacial activity that
formed the topography. There is no regard for wells or source water protection
legislation. To plan and place valves on the assumption that slopes and water
bodies are all impervious is not reasonable. It is an outdated logic and a
dangerous way to plan a pipeline.
52.The valve placement locations should be assessed on an ongoing basis because
over time, circumstances that warranted the valves original placement can change.
The characteristics of water channels changes as cities grow because higher
stormwater runoff widens channels. Climate change can produce more storm runoff
too. The pre-development data that was used 30 years back might not apply today so
please include a review of valve placement and make sure it is up to code as a
condition of draft approval.
53. Government agencies have identified geological risks located in the area of
Line 10, 11 and Westover but should an earthquake happen, who pays for it and can
we afford that kind of compensation? I include Attachment 24 which is a CBC
article titled Major quake could pose systemic risk to Canada's financial sector
published on Aug 3, 2016. It states in the first and second paragraph:

A major earthquake could pose a serious risk to Canada's economy, says a new

report from the 0.0. Howe Institute that calls for action to bolster the

financial system so it could better handle the aftermath of such a disaster.

Canada's property and casualty insurers could handle claims totaling up to

$30 billion, says the report's author, Nick Le Pan. Beyond that, "the _

catastrophic losses would exceed the existing capacity of Canada's insurance

industry,” Le Pan says.
54. Attachment 25 is the Safety and Security of Energy Pipelines in Canada: A
Report to Ministers Energy and Mines Ministers’ Conference Sudbury, Ontario August
2014. On Page 65 of the PDF/page 60 of the report it states in a section specific
to Ontario, the following:

There is no independent financial backstop in the event a company is unable I

to pay for the costs of an incident.
55. On August 8 2016, I was editing this Affidavit when out of curiosity, I visited
the Earthquaketrack com website and did a quick search for seismic events in the
Toronto area. That is when I found out there was an earthquake on Friday Aug.5 2015
at the same time I was writing about the seismic risk. See Attachment 26 for

             Jefferson Salamander (Ambystoma jeffersonianum )
Current Designations:
GRANK – G4 Dec. 28, 2001
NRANK Canada – N2 Sept. 27 1998
COSEWIC -- Endangered Nov. 2010
SARA – Threatened Schedule 1
General Status Canada – At Risk
ESA 2007 – Threatened
SRANK –S2
General Status Ontario – At Risk
Distribution and Status Outside Ontario:
The distribution of A. jeffersonianum is limited to eastern North America, from New York
and New England southwest to Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky and Indiana (Petranka
1998, Bogart and Klemens 1997, 2008). Isolated populations have been recorded in
east-central Illinois (Petranka 1998, Mullen and Klueh 2009). For much of this range,
genetic data are not available so the continental distribution of pure A. jeffersonianum
and unisexuals that use A. jeffersonianum as a sperm donor is uncertain (Bogart and
Klemens 2008). In Canada, Jefferson Salamander occurs only in southern Ontario.
The core of the range of pure A. jeffersonianum populations likely extends from
Pennsylvania southwestward to Kentucky. The jeffersonianum genome is widely
distributed in eastern North America but exists primarily in polyploidy unisexuals (Bogart
and Klemens 1997). Individuals that have solely the A. jeffersonianum genome occur in
many “hybridized” populations.
                                  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
                                              2
 Native Status
Yes. Ambystoma jeffersonianum, has been known to exist in Canada only since 1976
when a population was discovered in southern Ontario (Weller and Sprules 1976). It has
clearly been here much longer.
Taxonomic Distinctness
Yes. Jefferson Salamander (Ambystoma jeffersonianum) was first described by Green
in 1827 (in Uzzell 1967). Since then there has been considerable confusion about the
species’ taxonomy because of the sympatric occurrence of polyploid, all-female
unisexual populations of Ambystoma salamanders that use sperm from male Jefferson
Salamanders in reproduction. Since the last report (COSSARO 2000), there has been
significant new scientific information that allows more accurate and precise estimates of
numbers and distribution of Jefferson Salamanders in Ontario (COSEWIC 2010, in
press). This new information clarifies further the relationship between Jefferson
Salamander (JJ) and sympatric populations of all female unisexual Ambystoma (LJJ)
salamanders.
Designatable Units
There is no evidence of major genetic differences in A. jeffersonianum in Canada, no
significant natural disjunction and all populations occur in the same ecoregion.
Therefore, the species is considered a single Designatable Unit. It is possible that an
assessment should be conducted on the unisexuals. They may constitute a separate
DU but it would not be a Jefferson Salamander DU, because the unisexuals share
genomes with other ambystomids.
                               PRIORITY-SETTING CRITERIA
Recent Arrival
No. Although first reported in Canada by Weller and Sprules in 1976, it has
undoubtedly been present here for at least hundreds of years (Zammit and Oldham
2000).
Non-resident
No.
                        PRIMARY CRITERIA (rarity and declines)
1. Global Rank
Not in any category. It is a G4 as assessed by NatureServe in 2001 (NatureServe
2011). However, given the taxonomic confusion and lack of investigation to accurately
identify the species from unisexuals and similar ambystomid species, Jefferson
Salamanders may be less common than the NatureServe rank suggests.
2. Global Decline
                                               3
 Insufficient Information. There are few trend data available, and no suggestion of a
widespread decline, but problems with identification without genetic data give this
assessment a high degree of uncertainty.
3. Northeastern North America Ranks
Special Concern. It occurs in 15 of 28 northeastern North American jurisdictions and
SRank or equivalent information is available for 14 of 15 jurisdictions = 93%. Classified
as S1, S2, SH, or SX in 5 of 14 = 36% (Table 1).
4. Northeastern North America Decline
Insufficient Information. There is insufficient information to assess trends across the
species’ range.
5. Ontario Occurrences
Special Concern. COSEWIC recognizes 33 extant locations (COSEWIC 2010 in
press), while the Ontario NHIC database identifies 46 EOs (NHIC 2011). Both sources
support a Special Concern status for this criterion (20-50 occurrences)
6. Ontario Decline
Threatened. Of 87 sites from which salamanders of the Jeffersonianum complex have
been recorded, only 33 have been confirmed to have A. jeffersonianum (JJ) or
unisexuals (LJJ) over the past decade. Assuming all 33 locations have pure Jefferson
Salamanders (JJ), then the decline over the past three generations (~33 years) is 60%.
However, other samples from ponds known to have pure Jefferson Salamanders
suggest the decline is higher (COSEWIC 2010 in press). Repeat surveys over a 15-
year timeframe (1990-2005) revealed that most populations were declining and some
were extirpated. For example, surveys of 18 historically known breeding sites along the
Niagara Escarpment that were documented in 1990-91 revealed only 3 sites that were
confirmed to still be supporting A. jeffersonianum populations in 2003-04 (COSEWIC
2010, in press), an apparent decline of 83%.
7. Ontario’s Conservation Responsibility
Not in any category. Ontario has less than 10% of global range, albeit the most
interesting 10%.
                   SECONDARY CRITERIA (threats and vulnerability)
1. Population Sustainability
Endangered. The rapid decline in distribution and abundance in the past 30 years
appears to be caused by loss of habitat (COSEWIC 2010 in press) and by the
increasing impact of the kleptogenic unisexuals. This threat is the so-called “Clanton
effect”, a term coined by Minton (1954), that would result in a population crash of both
A. jeffersonianum and unisexuals because there would no longer be any
spermatophores. The reason for this loss of spermatophores is that as the unisexuals
increase they would take more and more spermatophores leading to a decline in
                                              4
 reproductive success of Jefferson females. The Clanton effect has not been
documented in any population; however there is current research to test this hypothesis
(JP Bogart pers. comm. August 2010). If male A. jeffersonianum are extirpated, the
unisexual population crashes unless they can use another species as a sperm donor. It
is also interesting to realize that unisexuals can only successfully immigrate to ponds
that already have acceptable sperm donors.
2. Lack of Regulatory Protection for Exploited Wild Populations
Not in any category. There is no known harvest in Ontario. The species is protected
under the Endangered Species Act, 2007.
3. Direct Threats
Endangered. The loss, alteration and increasing isolation of breeding ponds and their
surrounding deciduous forest habitat is a major set of direct threats. The species
occupies areas under intense development pressure from urbanization, road
proliferation, aggregate extraction and drainage for agriculture and other activities. The
species has an affinity for upland deciduous forests, and requires vernal (temporary),
fishless ponds for breeding and are extremely philopatric. These breeding ponds
become unsuitable if their hydrology changes (e. g. dry out too quickly) or if predatory
fish are introduced. Migration to and from breeding ponds can be disrupted by
roadways, silt fencing, drainage ditches, plantations, or other barriers (COSEWIC
2010). Clearing ponds or surrounding habitat of woody debris can also destroy
salamander habitat. Even though much of the species’ Ontario range is protected under
the Niagara Escarpment Act, the Green Belt, the Canadian Species at Risk Act (SARA),
not to mention the Ontario Endangered Species Act of 2007, ponds continue to be lost
to anthropogenic activities. Another direct threat is from the Ambystoma unisexuals.
These can increase to greatly outnumber pure Jefferson Salamanders and deprive the
Jefferson females of sperm to fertilize their eggs. This outcome leads to the extirpation
of Jefferson’s from the breeding pond, and ultimately, could also lead to extirpation of
the unisexuals if no other ambystomatid salamanders are present.
4. Specialized Life History or Habitat-use Characteristics
Endangered. Jefferson Salamanders require temporary, fishless ponds to breed and an
extensive surrounding moist deciduous forest for other activities. This life history is not
particularly specialized except in the context of the species being found almost entirely
in areas currently under intense development pressure. In this ecological context, the
species is highly vulnerable given its specialized needs and limited dispersal capacities.
Unlike many other pond breeding amphibians, Jefferson Salamanders have an
extended lifespan and late maturity and are vulnerable to increased adult mortality
which occurs with increased anthropogenic disturbance and presence of roads or other
features that must be crossed on breeding migrations. (COSEWIC 2010).

                                          SUMMARY
Jefferson Salamander (Ambystoma jeffersonianum) is Endangered in Ontario because
of recent and ongoing declines in population. Since the 2000 status report, our
knowledge of the abundance and distribution of Jefferson Salamander has changed and
the risk of extinction in this species has increased. Molecular genetic analysis of tissue
samples allows identification of individuals and has generated more accurate and
precise estimates of numbers and distribution. The new data clarify the relationship
between Jefferson Salamander (JJ) and sympatric populations of all female unisexual
Ambystoma (LJJ) salamander. In Ontario, all populations of A. jeffersonianum (JJ) also
contain unisexual Ambystoma (LJJ). Ambystoma jeffersonianum has not been found in
all populations containing LJJ unisexuals, but it is presumed that A. jeffersonianum is or
was also present as a sperm donor. Of 87 sites known to have JJ or LJJ salamanders,
only about one third still have extant populations of Jefferson Salamanders (JJ), many
have fewer individuals of Jefferson Salamanders than originally thought. Unisexual LJJ
females outnumber Jefferson females, often by a wide margin. The absolute number
and proportion of JJ to LJJ have declined in virtually all ponds where repeated tissue
samples have conclusively identified JJ from unisexual LJJ. Threats to the survival of
the species include loss of ponds and terrestrial habitat to development, fragmentation
of locations by roads and uninhabitable terrain. These changes also can affect local
hydrology and the impact on the salamanders is amplified by introduction of predatory
fish into ponds. These salamanders can live a long time (~30 years), making them very
vulnerable to threats associated with development.

                      Ontario Evaluation Using COSEWIC Criteria
                   Regional (Ontario) COSEWIC Criteria Assessment
Criterion A – Decline in Total Number of Mature Individuals
ENDANGERED. Meets Endangered under A2bc+4bc as the total number of mature
individuals has declined by more than 50% over the past 33 years. The decline has not
ceased and may not be reversible. The decline is likely to continue at a similar rate or
perhaps accelerate as potentially negative effects of the unisexuals increases. The
decline is based on an appropriate index (number of locations) of abundance
(subcriterion b) and a decline in IAO, EO and habitat quality (subcriterion c).
Criterion B – Small Distribution Range and Decline or Fluctuation
ENDANGERED. Meets Endangered under B2ab(i,ii,iii,iv,v) as the IAO (196 km²) is
lower than the Endangered threshold, the species habitat is estimated to be severely
fragmented, and there is an observed and inferred continuing decline in b(i,ii,iii,iv,v).
Criterion C – Small and Declining Number of Mature Individuals
Not applicable. Not applicable as the total number of mature individuals is unknown.
Criterion D – Very Small or Restricted Total Population
Not applicable.
Criterion E – Quantitative Analysis
Not applicable.
                                      Rescue Effect
No. It is highly improbable that there could be rescue from USA populations because
the species is a poor disperser. The closest U.S. populations of A. jeffersonianum to
Ontario populations are in Cattaraugus and Wayne counties in New York where
unisexual LJJ are also found (Bogart and Klemens 2008). Considering the limited
movements in this species, current distribution, and barriers to dispersal, rescue from
the U.S. is highly improbable

Why Canadian pipeline companies are moving billions in

TransCanada Corp. announced on Wednesday it would sell its remaining 30% stake in the Bison pipeline.                                               Scott Dalton/Bloomberg
CALGARY • Canadian pipeline companies are moving billions of dollars worth of assets to their U.S. subsidiaries, a move that allows
them to pay less in tax and raise more capital for their major projects.
On Wednesday, TransCanada Corp. announced it would sell its remaining 30% stake in the Bison pipeline, which moves natural gas
between Wyoming and the U.S. Midwest, to its U.S. subsidiary TC PipeLines LP for $215­million. TransCanada president and CEO
Russ Girling said in a press release the transaction was part of the company’s strategy to transfer all of its U.S. gas pipelines to the
master limited partnership (MLP).
Mr. Girling said those deals will help fund the company’s $38­billion capital program and added, “We intend to drop down the
remainder of those assets on a more sizeable, frequent basis over the coming quarters and years.”
Executives at competing midstream company Enbridge Inc. said Tuesday the company had identified $24­billion in assets that could
potentially be dropped down to its three subsidiaries, or “sponsored vehicles” as the company describes them, in order to finance its
own $44­billion capital program.
“Our sponsored vehicle strategy has arguably been slow to develop,” said Enbridge senior vice­president, finance John Whelen at the
company’s investor day in Toronto. The company has transferred $4.2­billion worth of assets to one such subsidiary, Enbridge
Income Fund Holdings, since 2011.

Flurry of deals in Canada's oil patch belies energy sector's fragile state
TransCanada sells stake in Bison, hints at accelerating drop downs
In the past two weeks, the parent company has accelerated its drop downs. On Sept. 17, the parent company announced it had
proposed a transfer of its remaining 66.7% ownership stake in the U.S. segment of its Alberta Clipper pipeline to subsidiary Enbridge
Energy Partners LP for $900­million. Then on Sept. 22, the company announced it had transferred $1.76­billion worth of natural gas
and diluent pipeline assets to Enbridge Income Fund, another of the parent company’s subsidiaries.
Both Enbridge Energy Partners and the parent company’s third subsidiary, Midcoast Energy Partners, are both structured as MLPs.
Rick Whitley, managing partner at accounting firm KPMG’s Calgary office, said that an MLP is an U.S. corporate structure similar to
the income trust model that was once prevalent in the Canadian energy sector. A 2006 change in tax laws eliminated the ability of
income trusts to pay pre­tax dividends to unit holders.
RBC Capital Markets analyst Matthew Kolodzie said that both Enbridge and TransCanada have been using the MLP model as a
source of financing for their major projects that does not require issuing common equity, preferred shares, debt or drawing on their
credit facilities. “They both need a lot of external capital because they have a lot of growth,” Mr. Kolodzie said. Drop downs, he said,
offer the parent company “a non­debt source of capital so it’s good for the balance sheet and it’s not really dillutive to the
shareholder.”
Instead, the subsidiary company can raise debt or equity financing and pay a distribution back to the investor, in this case, the parent
company. Enbridge, for example, received $421­million in cash, $878­million in long­term interest bearing notes and $461 million in
equity from Enbridge Income Fund in the transfer of its natural gas and diluent pipelines.
Mr. Kolodzie confirmed that MLPs offer a tax advantage for companies.
After Houston­based midstream firm Kinder Morgan Inc. announced its US$44­billion plan to consolidate its subsidiary MLPs into a
single corporate entity, analysts in the States said the company risked an increased tax bill, Barron’s reported.

Is Enbridge Pipeline Inc. a company? A simple yes or no response please.
Is Enbridge Income Fund a company? Again, it is a simple yes or no response please.
Yes to both.
Does Enbridge Pipeline Inc. have any paperwork to suggest that they sought NEB permission for the transfer of
these assets and ownership of LIne 9 to reasonably prove compliance to section 74 of the NEB Act?
As the NEB already indicated to you, an application for a transfer of shares is not required so there is no documentation.
Is there any written information to verify that the NEB, Municipalities, Land Owners or First Nation's were
reasonably informed of this transfer of assets?
 Our plans were well publicized with numerous news releases, http://www.enbridge.com/MediaCentre/News.aspx
conference calls and supporting materials, http://www.enbridge.com/MediaCentre/News.aspx as well as MD&A and
financial reporting disclosure http://www.enbridge.com/InvestorRelations/Events.aspx. Our plans were broadly
disseminated well in advance of the Enbridge Income Fund shareholder vote. We will have a full 9 months between when
we first announced our plans and closing, and we’ve been speaking openly and publicly about it during that entire time.
Further, Section 75 of the NEB Act still applies to Enbridge Pipelines Inc., who owns the facilities, to make full
compensation for any damage sustained as a result of its activities, nor are there any affects to civil liabilities.
To be more clear on actual ownership with respect to Line 9, it is owned by Enbridge Pipelines Inc. both before and after
the transaction. There was no change in direct ownership of this asset. The restructuring was an optimization of our
financial structure and has no impact on our operations. Enbridge remains the operator and manager of all of its assets
and companies both before and after the transaction. There is no change to our comprehensive insurance coverage or our
emergency response capabilities. Safety and operational reliability remain our number one priority.
Thank you kindly for your time.

Hello, again, Ms. Lanteigne. To be clear, the ownership transfer and financial restructuring has nothing to do with
hydrotesting of Line 9 or any other line. It was conceived of and executed well before any NEB mandated requirement
for hydrotesting on the line. Also, stakeholders and/or municipalities would not have to manage interactions with more
than one entity, as our liability obligation does not change and asset transfers are from one entity to another, not to a
variety of holdings. There is, in fact, more consolidation of assets now than before. If you have any further questions, or
require further clarifications, please let me know and I would be happy assist you.

Hello, Louisette, I hope you are well. We have been conducting internal financial restructuring of assets in the past year
or so, that will have no impact on our liability, levels of insurance, operations or continuing commitment to the safety and
integrity of our operations. They are primarily for greater and easier access to, and ability to raise capital, for future
major projects and increase dividends to shareholders. We have transferred many of the Liquids assets, including Line 9,
to the Enbridge Income Fund. For more information here are our releases on this topic. Most recent:

Subject: Line 9 inquiry
Hello Mr. White
Since the NEB Line 9 hearings there have been several acquisitions and ownership transfers made with
Enbridge as noted in the press. I was curious about the current ownership of Enbriidge Line 9. Is it still under
Enbridge Pipelines Inc. currently?
Are there any future plans to merge to merge that project with any other Enbridge firms?
Thanks

1. Introduction to name policies
Table of Contents
1.1 How Do You Reserve a Corporate Name?
1.2 Previously Existing Reservation by a Person Other Than the Applicant
1.3 Interpretations and Definitions
1.4 Facts Necessary for a Name Decision
1.5 Elements of a Corporate Name — Distinctiveness, Descriptiveness and a Legal Element
The rules for the granting of names under the Canada Business Corporations Act (CBCA) and the
Canada Corporations Act (CCA) are almost the same. Essentially, an applicant cannot have a name
that
       lacks distinctiveness
       is likely to cause confusion with other businesses
       is likely to mislead the public
       is reserved for another business
       is obscene, or
       has an unacceptable French or English form
The policies contained in this document are guidelines for interpreting the name regulations. They
demonstrate how corporate name regulations will be applied in certain types of fact situations.
Since, however, each name decision requires an exercise of judgment, based on the particular facts
of that case, and after considering a number of factors, any one particular regulation and guideline
may not necessarily determine the decision.
The following checklist should provide assistance in deciding which policies may be important for a
particular corporate name:
    1. Have you included an absolutely prohibited term in your name? Check regulation 25 (see
       section 3.0 (cs01286.html) of this document) prohibiting the use of "Cooperative",
       "Coopérative", "Co­op" or "Pool", "Parliament Hill" or "Colline du Parlement", "Royal Canadian
       Mounted Police" or "Gendarmerie Royale du Canada", "RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted
    Police)" or "GRC (Gendarmerie Royale du Canada)", "United Nations" or "Nations Unies", "UN
   (United Nations)" or "ONU (Organisation des Nations Unies)".
2. If you are using "Canada" or the name of a province in your name, check regulation 26(a) and
   (b) (see section 4.2 (cs01287.html#p4.2) of this document) which prohibits a name if it
   connotes government sponsorship and control. Your name should not give the impression of
   being a government sponsored entity unless the government consents in writing to use of the
   name.
3. If your corporation will be in a professional or educational field, ensure that your name does
   not mislead or connote affiliation with an existing university or professional association. (See
   regulation 26(c) and section 4.3 (cs01287.html#p4.3) of this document).
4. If your corporation will have activities of a financial nature, make sure the name does not
   connote carrying on the business of a bank, loan company, insurance company, trust
   company, other financial intermediary, or stock exchange unless the appropriate federal or
   provincial regulator consents in writing to the use of the name. (See regulation 26(d) and
   section 4.4 (cs01287.html#p4.4) of this document).
5. Your name must have some distinctiveness to distinguish your business from that of others.
   You cannot have a name that merely describes the business of a corporation, or its goods and
   services, or a quality of them, or is merely the name of a person or a geographic location.
   Check regulation 30(1) (see section 6.0 (cs01289.html) of this document). Keep in mind that
   the more distinctive your name is, the more protection it will get.
6. If you are using the name of an individual in your corporate name, you may be required to file
   a consent of that individual unless he or she is an incorporator or unless the individual died
   more than 30 years ago, or unless the name has secondary meaning. (See regulation 28 and
   section 6.4 (cs01289.html#p6.4) and section 6.6 (cs01289.html#p6.6) of this document).
7. If you are using initials in your proposed corporate name, you should check section 2.3
   (cs01290.html#p2.3) of this document for guidelines explaining when names with initials are
   confusing. If you are proposing the use of initials with surnames, see also section 2.8.8
   (cs01290.html#p2.8.8) of this document.
8. Your corporation should not appear to be the holding corporation of other, unrelated
   businesses which happen to use the same distinctive element as yours in their names. The
   use of the word "Group" can give this impression. Check section 2.4 (cs01290.html#p2.4) of
   this document if you are planning to use the word "Group".
9. The name you propose will not be found to be available if it seems likely to cause confusion
   with existing business names (whether or not incorporated), official marks or trade­marks.
   Confusion can be between names A and B so that A and B are likely to be mistaken for the
   same corporation, or it can be between A and B if A misleadingly looks related to B. Both are
   instances of confusion.
     You are required to obtain and file a Nuans report that will list business names and trade­
    marks which look and sound the same as your name. A Nuans report may be obtained in two
    ways:
        1. A Nuans report may be requested from a private company known as a search house.
           You can find a list of these firms on the Corporations Canada website
           (www.corporationscanada.ic.gc.ca) (http://www.Nuans.com/houses­maisons/nm_form­
           forme_mn_en.cgi) by following the links "Name a Corporation", and "Nuans Registered
           Members, or in the Yellow Pages of your telephone directory under incorporating
           companies, incorporation name search, searchers of records or trade­mark agents
           — registered. The search house will charge a fee for this service.
        2. A Nuans report may be ordered online at the Electronic Filing Centre, at
           www.corporationscanada.ic.gc.ca (http://www.nuans.com/nuansinfo_en/faq_en.htm#rts­
           str) from the Nuans Real­Time System. The system provides direct access to the Nuans
           search service but does not provide the professional assistance and recommendations
           often available from a registered Nuans search house. Applicants should note that a
           Nuans report that is generated and submitted to the Director may be rejected if the
           proposed name does not meet the requirements of the CBCA (Canadian Business
           Corporations Act)/CCA (Canada Corporations Act) name regulations.
    If you order a Nuans report, that report has a life of 90 days from the date it is requested. Most
    search houses can advise you whether your proposed name is likely to be accepted by
    Corporations Canada. The final decision, however, always rests with Corporations Canada.
    Corporations Canada will examine the Nuans search with certain factors in mind: Do any of
    the names, trade­marks or official marks which sound alike appear to be in the same business
    as yours? Would they likely have the same type of client, or territory of operation as yours?
    How much protection do they deserve?
    Corporations Canada will have the information listed in the paragraph above only if you
    provide it to them when making your submission. If you have satisfied yourself that your
    corporation will not create a likelihood of confusion, give Corporations Canada the basis for
    your conclusions. Chances are it will satisfy Corporations Canada. Name submissions must
    often be rejected for lack of this kind of information. For more details concerning how
    Corporations Canada determines whether there is a likelihood of confusion, see regulations 18
    and 19 (see section 6.1 (cs01289.html#p6.1)). For more details about what information to file
    see section 1.3. Failure to provide this information with the first submission of your proposed
    corporate name will likely result in the rejection of your name request. Approval is often not
    possible until the information is provided.
10. If you propose to take the name of a corporation which has been inactive for 2 years, check
    regulation 20 (see section 2.5 (cs01290.html#p2.5) of this document). For a period of two
    years after the inactive corporation ceases operations, the memory of its name is presumed to
    stay in the public's mind. You will not be able to have the exact same name or the same
     distinctive element during that two year period. As explained in item 11 below, you may
    choose to resolve this problem by adding some distinguishing feature to your name which can
    be removed after the two year period has expired.
11. Under certain conditions, you are permitted to have names that appear to be confusing with an
    existing business name (i.e. (id est (that is)), appear to be the same business as an existing
    business, or appear to be affiliated with an existing business). Essentially, the existing
    business must consent in writing to the use of its name, or, must consent and undertake to
    change its name. Even then, because of the two­year period referred to in item 10 above,
    there may still be confusion unless certain other conditions are met. If you wish to use the
    name of a corporation which has been inactive for two years, check regulation 20 (see section
    2.8.1 (cs01290.html#p2.8.1) of this document). If you wish to incorporate an affiliate of an
    existing corporation, check regulation 21 (see section 2.8.2 (cs01290.html#p2.8.2) of this
    document). If you wish to incorporate a corporation which will take over the business of an
    existing corporation, check regulation 22 (see section 2.8.3 (cs01290.html#p2.8.3) of this
    document). If you are proposing an amalgamation, check regulation 17(2), 23 and 72.1 (see
    section 2.8.5 (cs01290.html#p2.8.5) of this document) for names which are permissible for the
    amalgamated corporation.
    In order to use a name identical to the name of an affiliated corporation whose assets your
    corporation has or will acquire, check regulation 24 (see section 2.8.6 (cs01290.html#p2.8.6)
    of this document). If the existing corporation whose name you wish to take is bankrupt, check
    section 2.8.9 (cs01290.html#p2.8.9) of this document for the consent that is required.
12. If your proposed name appears to be confusing with a trade­mark, special considerations
    apply. If a trade­mark has been registered for 5 or more years, the applicant must get the
    consent of the trade mark owner. If the trade­mark has been registered for less than 5 years
    this may not be necessary. For information on how to get protection from trade­marks which
    may be registered after your incorporation, check section 9 (cs04538.html). If a proposed
    name is confusingly similar to an existing official mark adopted and used pursuant to the
    provisions of section 9 of the Trade­marks Act, it will be rejected. (For more information on
    trade­marks, official marks and trade names, see section 2.7 (cs01290.html#p2.7) of this
    document).
13. Corporations Canada is reluctant to approve names for profit­making corporations which
    contain words such as "institute" or "club". These words are more commonly used in the
    names of not­for­profit corporations and may, for that reason, be misleading. (See section 7.0
    (cs01291.html)).
14. There is no difference between the regulations that apply in respect of the continuance or
    revival of a corporation and the regulations that apply in respect of incorporation.
15. If you are proposing a bilingual corporate name, you must ensure that the two language forms
    are not so different from one another that they appear to be two different corporations. (See
    section 9.0 (cs04538.html) of this document).
    16. If the name you are proposing is in a combined English and French form, it can only include
        one legal element which is "Inc." and this legal element must be at the end of the name. (See
        Regulation 32 and section 9.5 (cs04538.html#p9.5) of this document).
   17. If the French and English forms of your corporate name are similar enough, you may not need
        two Nuans search reports. (See section 9.4 (cs04538.html#p9.4) of this document).
   18. If a corporate name contains a word or phrase, or connotes a business that is obscene, the
        name is prohibited. (See Regulation 27 and section 5.0 (cs01288.html) of this document).
1.1 How Do You Reserve a Corporate Name?
To reserve your proposed corporate name, you must:
    1. obtain a Nuans search on the proposed name, and
    2. apply to Corporations Canada for determination that the proposed name does not contravene
        the regulations. In order for Corporations Canada to make this determination, the proposed
        name has to be submitted to Corporations Canada accompanied by the Nuans search report.
        This can be done before articles are filed if it is important that the articles not be rejected (save
        yourself time by using this method!). Otherwise, Corporations Canada's decision will be made
        when the articles (and other forms necessary to complete the application) are filed with a
        proposed name. The articles will be rejected if it is found that the name is not available.
Once Corporations Canada has decided that a particular name is approved, that name is
automatically reserved for 90 days, retroactive to the date the Nuans search report was requested
(i.e. (id est (that is)) the date appearing in the right­hand column beside the proposed name). Please
note that if two consecutive dates appear in the right hand column, the reservation will be retroactive
to the earlier of the two dates.
1.2 Previously Existing Reservation by a Person Other
Than the Applicant
Under the CBCA (Canadian Business Corporations Act), the Director is not permitted to reserve a
corporate name if it is the same as, or is confusing with, a corporate name that has, before the date
of the request, been reserved by the Director for another person.
1.3 Interpretations and Definitions
The regulations set out the following definitions:
    Reg. 17. (1) The following definitions apply in this Part.
    "corporate name" means the name of a corporation. (Version anglaise seulement)
    "distinctive", in relation to a trade­name, considered as a whole and by its separate elements,
   means a trade­name that distinguishes the business in association with which it is used or
   intended to be used by its owner from any other business or that is adapted to so distinguish
   them. (distinctive)
   "official mark" means an official mark within the meaning of subparagraph 9 (1) (n) (iii) of the
   Trade­marks Act. (marque officielle)
   "trade­mark", means a trade­mark as defined in section 2 of the Trade­marks Act. (marque de
   commerce)
   "trade name" means a name that has been reserved by the Director under subsection 11(1) of
   the Act, or the name under which a business is carried on, or intended to be carried on,
   whether it is a corporate name or the name of a body corporate, trust, partnership, sole
   proprietorship or individual. (dénomination commerciale)
   "use" means the actual use by a person that carries on business in Canada or elsewhere.
   (emploi)
   Reg. 18. A corporate name is confusing with
       a. a trade­mark or an official mark if it is the same as that trade­mark or official mark or if
          the use of both the corporate name and either the trade­mark or the official mark, as the
          case may be, is likely to lead to the inference that the business carried on or intended to
          be carried on under the corporate name and the business connected with the trade­mark
          or official mark, as the case may be, are one business, whether or not the nature of the
          business of each is generally the same; or
       b. a trade­name if it is the same as that trade­name or if the use of both names is likely to
          lead to the inference that the business carried on or intended to be carried on under the
          corporate name and the business carried on under the trade­name are one business,
          whether or not the nature of the business of each is generally the same.
1.4 Facts Necessary for a Name Decision
To obtain a favourable name decision, you must provide Corporations Canada with sufficient
information. Even if no confusingly similar names appear on the search report and there is therefore
no concern about confusion, without some information about what your business will be,
Corporations Canada cannot properly assess whether a name
       connotes government sponsorship
       connotes the business of trust, loan, insurance or banking
       misdescribes, or merely describes the business of a corporation
 If there are names on the search report that look or sound similar to your name, you must provide
the type of information listed in section 19 of the Regulations:
       the type of business the proposed corporation will carry on and how this business is
       dissimilar to the activities of existing businesses which have similar names.
       where the proposed corporation will carry on its business and whether this territorial area
       is different from the area in which other businesses with similar names and similar activities
       are operating.
       what types of clients and suppliers the proposed corporation will be doing business with
       and whether they are different from the types of clients with whom existing businesses, with
       similar names and similar activities in a similar territory, will do business (e.g. (per example),
       deal with retailers, computer programmers or the general public).
       the derivation of the distinctive element(s) of the proposed name. If there is a reasonable
       explanation for why the applicant wants that distinctive element, it is less likely to suspect that
       the applicant is trying to trade on the goodwill of an existing business with a similar name.
       whether the proposed corporation will be related to existing businesses with similar names
       or trade marks and if so, the written consent of some or all of them.
       whether the proposed corporation has a foreign parent with a similar name which carries on
       business or is known in Canada. If so, written consent is required and the proposed
       corporation must add "(Canada)" or "of Canada".
       whether an earlier reservation of a similar name which appears on the Nuans search report,
       was made by the same applicant.
       the written consent of an individual whose name appears in the corporate name, unless
       that individual is an incorporator. For the CBCA (Canadian Business Corporations Act), the
       consenting individual must indicate that he or she has or had a material interest in the
       corporation.
If the applicant fails to provide us with this information, the name must often be rejected because
Corporations Canada has no basis to be satisfied that the new corporate name will not create a
likelihood of confusion with existing similar names appearing on the search report.
Without this information it may appear that the proposed name will likely be confused with an
existing name which appears to be in the same business, in the same territory. With the information,
it may become clear that the two businesses are, in fact, significantly different, in different territories,
dealing with different types of suppliers and customers and therefore confusion is not likely.
Generally speaking, if the applicant has reviewed the Nuans search report carefully and is satisfied
in his/her own mind that the new corporation is not likely to cause confusion, it is merely a matter of
giving Corporations Canada sufficient information to reach the same conclusion. Applicants should
always be reasonably cautious in reaching their conclusion, however, because the applicant risks
being sued by an existing business or being required by Corporations Canada to change its
 corporate name after Corporations Canada has been persuaded by an existing business that the
new corporate name really does create a likelihood of confusion. Of course, the new corporation
would always have the opportunity to state its case before Corporations Canada's decision to
change its name was taken.
1.5 Elements of a Corporate Name — Distinctiveness,
Descriptiveness and a Legal Element
Generally, a corporate name is composed of three elements:
    a. A distinctive element which is the unique identifier of the name.
    b. A descriptive element which describes the line of business. (Not absolutely required)
    c. A legal element which indicates the legal status of the corporation as an incorporated body.
Example:
                            Example of Elements of a Corporate Name
        distinctive element>                   descriptive element                  legal element
  Telefax                           Commercial Communications                    Ltd.
To decide whether or not a proposed name is available, several guidelines apply. In accordance with
the CBCA (Canadian Business Corporations Act) and its regulations, Corporations Canada must
consider if the proposed name is:
    a. confusing
    b. absolutely prohibited
    c. qualifiedly prohibited
    d. obscene
    e. Lacking distinctiveness
     f. deceptively misdescriptive

  Enbridge pumping stations not up to code: NEB
           By Vincent McDermott

The National Energy Board is warning Calgary­based Enbridge Inc. that 117 pumping stations do not meet federal safety standards, and the
company has until April 15 to create a corrective action plan.
According to government documents, inspectors from the federal government inspected pipeline terminals in Edmonton, Westover and
Sarnia in 2011. Investigators discovered insufficient emergency shut­down systems and emergency back­up power generators in the event
of an accident.
Pumping stations provide power to move liquids such as crude oil or diluted bitumen through a pipeline network.
As a response, Enbridge promised to address the problem by October 2012. When the deadline approached, however, the company sent
the NEB a letter stating it needed more time to develop an appropriate action plan. In a letter dated March 15, the company was granted an
extension to April 15.
“The Board finds that the extension to 15 April 2013 requested by Enbridge to develop a complete corrective action plan for its operating
pump stations is acceptable, considering the magnitude of the work required to address the non­compliances,” the letter states. “Enbridge
indicated that further study was required … to ensure that the implementation of any given solution will not result in residual risks.”
So far, the company has not been fined for failing to meet safety regulations over the incident.
This is not the first time Enbridge’s vast pipeline network has been criticized. In June, a company pumping station northeast of Edmonton
spilled 230,000 litres of crude oil into a nearby field. The compound did not enter any waterways.
In the United States, the company has been criticized for a 2010 pipeline rupture spilling 20,000 barrels of diluted bitumen into the
Kalamazoo River, located halfway between Detroit and Lake Michigan. It cost $1 billion to clean up.
The company is also seeking federal approval to build a 1,177 kilometre pipeline carrying 193,000 barrels of Albertan crude oil to tankers
bound for oil­thirsty markets in Asia.
The only hurdle standing in Enbridge’s way is fierce local opposition, mostly from environmental groups and several aboriginal communities.

 REVIEW OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE FOR THE WATERLOO AND PARIS/ GALT
MORAINES
1.0       Introduction
1.1      BACKGROUND
The Ministry of the Environment (MOE) received two Environmental Bill of Rights applications regarding
the Waterloo Moraine and a similar application for a review of the Paris/ Galt Moraines. It is our
understanding that as part of the MOE’s continuing process to improve upon water-related best practices
and policies, the MOE agreed to conduct a review of each “moraine” to determine if there is a need to
develop additional provisions to protect groundwater and source water of the Waterloo Moraine and
Paris/ Galt Moraines, beyond the current provisions in existing policies and legislation.
In response to the EBR applications, the MOE agreed to undertake a review of the need to develop new
provincial policy or legislation to protect the Waterloo and Paris/ Galt Moraines, in order to protect
groundwater functions in the Grand River watershed and, where applicable, other watersheds located
along the Paris/ Galt Moraines. Several applicants also asked for a review of the Clean Water Act, 2006
and a review of the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS), 2005 developed by the Ministry of Municipal
Affairs and Housing (MMAH). These requests were denied, as any legislation or policies made during the
five years preceding the date of the EBR application for review are out of the scope of the review.
As part of the review, the MOE issued a Request for Resources for a “Review of the State of Knowledge
of the Waterloo and Paris/ Galt Moraines” in support of the EBR Reviews. As outlined in the Request for
Resources (RFR), the primary objectives of the EBR review are to:
     1) Review existing policies related to protection of groundwater recharge; and,
     2) Determine if there is a need for new provincial policy to protect the Waterloo and Paris/ Galt
         Moraines, in particular to protect groundwater and source waters from the potential impacts of
         development, including contamination, reductions in recharge, and the loss of existing
         groundwater volumes.
The focus of this RFR study is to conduct a review of the current state of hydrogeological information, for
both the Waterloo Moraine and the Paris/ Galt Moraines, and determine if there are information/data gaps
that could impede the implementation of existing policies or the development of new policies with respect
to protection the Waterloo and Paris/ Galt Moraines.
1.2    STUDY OBJECTIVES
The primary objective of the overall review, as outlined in the RFR, is to provide background information
on the state of knowledge of the general physical conditions and hydrologic functions of the Waterloo and
Paris/ Galt Moraines. The objectives of the RFR review are to:
     •   summarize the state of hydrogeologic knowledge and determine gaps, if any, which would be
         required to be filled to enable policy to protect the Waterloo and Paris/ Galt Moraines;
     •   provide an overview of current and potential threats and impacts on the hydrologic functions of
         the moraines; and,
     •   review the best management practices and mitigative measures to protect moraine functions.
A report is to be prepared that will identify if there are information gaps in the current understanding of:
     •   the groundwater recharge, discharge and storage functions of each moraine;
     •   the linkage of moraine functions to surface water quality and quantity functions; and,

1.3     STUDY AREAS
Figure 1.3.1 shows the approximate boundaries of the Waterloo and Paris/ Galt Moraines as presented
in mapping produced by the MOE for this study. The general boundaries of the moraines were produced
based on a combination of several criteria including, glacial depositional environments, topographic
descriptions and material types described by the OGS in the Surficial Geology of Southern Ontario

(2003). One of these criteria is areas mapped as being “hummocky” on surficial geology maps. As a
result, there may be specific areas included in the general mapping that are hummocky but may not be
part of the Waterloo or Paris/ Galt Moraines. A graphical refinement of the moraine mapping provided by
the MOE is not within the scope of this review. As indicated in Section 1.2, a component of this review is
to assess the state of knowledge of the interpretation of the boundaries of each of the moraines. For the
purpose of this study, the study area is generally defined by the aerial extent of the broadest
interpretation of the each of the moraines and could include areas beyond the “footprint” of the moraine
boundary, which may be interconnected through the aquifer system or through groundwater/surface water
connections with local streams or the Grand River.
          1.3.1    Waterloo Moraine
The study area is approximately 400 km2 in size and is located almost entirely within the Region of
Waterloo. The Region of Waterloo is made up of three major municipalities and four Townships as
shown in Figure 1.3.2. The cities of Kitchener and Waterloo overlie much of the eastern portion of the
Waterloo Moraine while the western central and western portions of the Waterloo Moraine are primarily in
rural agricultural areas within Wilmot Township. The Waterloo Moraine is located in the central portion of
the Grand River watershed.
The study area encompasses the general “footprint” of the Waterloo Moraine, including geologic units
which may be above and below the depositional sediments associated with the formation of the Waterloo
Moraine. The area also encompasses geologic units and areas that may be hydrologically connected to
the Waterloo Moraine, including surface water features extending beyond the Waterloo Moraine to the
Grand River. This is discussed in detail in Section 5.3. A discussion of the boundary aspects of the
Waterloo Moraine is presented in Section 5.2.
          1.3.2    Paris and Galt Moraines
The Paris/ Galt Moraine system has been interpreted to extend from the northeast, in the Caledon area of
the Region of Peel, to an area southwest of Port Rowan, on the Lake Erie shoreline a distance of
approximately 150 kilometres. Figure 1.3.1 shows the distribution of the Paris and Galt Moraines as
provided by the MOE for this review. Details of the criteria used for this mapping are presented in Section
6.2.1. The study area encompasses the general “footprint” of the Paris/ Galt Moraines as it relates to
those criteria. The Wentworth Till of Paris/ Galt Moraine system extends south of the map area to the
southwest of Port Rowan as a surficial unit but without any significant topographic structure. It is also
recognized that certain moraine footprints north of Burford and in central Guelph are not considered part
of the Paris/ Galt Moraines (Bajc, 2008a).
The Paris/ Galt Moraine system extends across the upper tier municipalities of Peel, Halton, Wellington,
Waterloo, Brant and Norfolk and the Cities of Guelph and Cambridge. It is found within parts of four
subwatersheds in the Credit River watershed (CVC), six subwatersheds in the Grand River Watershed
(GRCA) and several smaller subwatersheds within the jurisdiction of the Hamilton, Halton and Long Point
Conservation Authorities.

    •    Ontario Geological Survey
The reports and data were reviewed primarily within the context of the understanding the moraines
related to the following:
    1. Hydrogeological characterization including geological history, hydrostratigraphy and groundwater
         flow.
    2. Aquifer delineation including groundwater availability and water quality within the moraines and
         connections to underlying or adjacent aquifers.
    3. Recharge potential within the general moraine footprint and the general water budget associated
         with the moraines.
    4. General groundwater connection of the moraines to surface water sources including streams,
         lakes and wetlands.
    5. Existing impacts on the moraine function due anthropogenic activities including urban
         development, industrial development, aggregate operation and agriculture. The general
         performance of existing management practices incorporated to mitigate or prevent impacts was
         also reviewed.
    6. The potential impact of climate change.
The availability of data, pertinent reports and knowledge associated with the moraines, general functions,
and potential impacts is critical in this hydrogeologic study, as it is in any hydrogeologic assessment. It is
inevitable that significant pertinent data and knowledge exists related to this study that was not practically
available during the time frame of this assessment. This is an inherent limitation of the groundwater
knowledge/database within the province and to an unfortunate extent both nationally and internationally.
The discussion of this limitation is based on the authors numerous extensive literature reviews for various
studies over the past decades. This issue has also been highlighted during various reviews of the state of
groundwater knowledge (e.g. Rivera, 2005; International Association for Great lakes Research, 2002;
Crow et al, 2003).
As part of this review, a general presentation of hydrogeological concepts and an overview of
groundwater issues related to potential impacts from land use activities is provided. This discussion is not

meant to be an exhaustive presentation, given the volumes of material available in the literature, but is
meant to provide a basic technical understanding for a more general audience.
2.0        Hydrogeologic Concepts
2.1     HYDROLOGIC CYCLE
The water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth is always moving, and the cycle of water
movement is known as the hydrologic cycle. Figure 2.1.1 shows a generalized example of the hydrologic
cycle.
One of the processes in the hydrologic cycle is the process of evaporation, where water moves from a
liquid on the surface of the Earth, to a vapour into the atmosphere. As the moist air is lifted into the
atmosphere, it cools and the water vapour condenses forming clouds, and the moisture is then returned
to the surface of the Earth as precipitation. Once the water reaches the surface of the Earth it can
either: evaporate back into the atmosphere; travel along the ground surface and runoff into lakes, river
and streams; or, it can move down through the soil and to the groundwater system. Groundwater flows
through the subsurface in pores and fractures and eventually discharges into streams, rivers or lakes. It
can be released back into the atmosphere through transpiration (the release of water back to the
atmosphere by plants) where the groundwater is close to the ground surface.
2.2     GROUNDWATER FLOW
Hydrogeology is the science that studies the movement of water beneath the ground (groundwater) and
its interaction or connection with water on the ground surface (i.e. rivers, streams, lakes and wetlands).
Groundwater is water that saturates or fills the pores and fractures of underlying soil or rock. The top
surface of this saturated ground is called the water table. The area between the ground surface and the
water table is referred to as the unsaturated zone. Water infiltrates from the ground surface and moves
downward through the unsaturated zone to the water table. As the water table builds or mounds up
groundwater begins to move or flow within the groundwater system. How fast this water moves
depends partly on the geologic material through which the water is migrating.
The process of water moving from the ground surface into the groundwater system is referred to as
recharge. The amount of water that infiltrates (recharges) into the ground is controlled by a number of
factors including: ground surface slope; vegetative type; and, the type of soil/geologic material present on
the ground surface.
Figure 2.2.1 shows a generalized groundwater flow system. The water table can be very close to ground
surface, or very deeply buried (several hundred meters in arid desert regions). Where groundwater flows
into surface water features such as rivers, streams and lakes, is referred to as groundwater discharge
(Figure 2.2.1). The component of surface water stream flow that is supplied to rivers and streams
exclusively from groundwater discharge is referred to as baseflow (see Section 2.2.1).
Rock or soil layers below the water table that can readily store and transmit useable amounts of water are
called aquifers. These units usually have a high permeability or hydraulic conductivity, which allows the
water to easily move through them. In some cases aquifers are separated from one another by geologic
units that impede the movement of groundwater. These formations have a low permeability or hydraulic
conductivity and are typically referred to as aquitards. Figure 2.2.1 shows an example of an aquitard
separating two aquifers.

 REVIEW OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE FOR THE WATERLOO AND PARIS/ GALT
MORAINES
Groundwater generally flows from areas of higher elevations such as hilltops or ridges, to areas of lower
elevations like rivers, streams and lakes. Groundwater also flows from areas of higher pressure, to areas
of lower pressure. Groundwater flows very slowly through the ground. In some well-fractured rocks or
very coarse gravels water may move 100 m or more in one day. Water will flow much more slowly
through clay or similar fine-grained materials, and may move less than a centimetre a day.
          2.2.1   Groundwater Recharge/ Discharge
As noted above, recharge occurs where precipitation infiltrates down through the ground and replenishes
the groundwater system. Recharge takes place intermittently, during and following periods of rain and
snowmelt, and in areas where the land is irrigated. Recharge areas are defined as the areas where water
is transmitted downward to the groundwater flow system. Figures 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 show examples of
recharge areas. The amount of water that infiltrates and recharges the groundwater system depends on:
vegetation; slope of the ground surface; surficial geology and soils; and, the presence/absence of low
hydraulic conductivity layers, such as clay, below the ground surface. Recharge is greatest in areas
where there are: permeable soils, such as sands and gravels, at ground surface; local depressions or
natural vegetative cover to capture water and prevent surface run off; and, no low hydraulic conductivity
layers above the water table to impede the downward movement of the water to the water table. These
factors control the hydrologic function of a particular area. The hydrologic function, in the context of this
review, is related to the physical factors that control the quantity of precipitation that can recharge the
groundwater system. The three main physical features that control the hydrologic function of an area are:
     •    topographic relief;
     •    permeability of the geologic material; and,
     •    drainage system connections (open or closed depressions).
The hydrologic function, as it relates to moraine features, is discussed in Section 3.2.
Groundwater discharge is the process whereby groundwater flows into surface water features such as
rivers, streams and lakes. Areas where this occurs are referred to as discharge areas. Groundwater
discharge most often occurs where the water table intersects the land surface, as shown in Figures 2.2.2
and 2.2.3, typically in lowland or valley areas such where wetlands, lakes or rivers are present. In some
areas of steep topography such as the sides of moraines or escarpments, seeps or springs may appear
where the water table intercepts the land surface or where a local clay layer is outcrops on a hill (see
Figure 2.2.1).
          2.2.2   Groundwater Flow and Scale
Groundwater flow systems are scalar and may be very local (i.e. groundwater discharges near where the
water was recharged) or regional (i.e. groundwater discharges tens or hundreds of km away from the
recharge area. Figure 2.2.2 shows an example of the scales of groundwater flow. In local groundwater
flow systems, groundwater flow paths are relatively short (<5 km for example) and water may take only
months or a few years to discharge to the ground surface. Deeper regional flow systems have much
longer groundwater flow paths and the distance between the recharge and discharge zones can be tens
or hundreds of kilometres (Figure 2.2.2). The variation between the two flow paths and the scale of the
groundwater flow system is a function of the type and nature of the geologic units (i.e. permeable and
well-connected or low permeability, impeding movement) as well as scale of topographic relief (i.e. a
locally flat area or a regional high relief area). Local flow systems are the shallowest and the most

MORAINES
dynamic, and as such, they tend to have the greatest interaction with local surface water features such as
rivers, lakes and wetlands.
          2.2.3    Water-Related Ecological Functions
As noted above, the regular and continuous discharge of groundwater into streams is referred to as
baseflow, and it is this baseflow is critical for the maintenance of aquatic life and various plant and
vegetation species. Species of fish such as brook trout and brown trout require a stable and continuous
flow of water into the rivers and streams to survive, especially in the summer and winter months when
there is decreased stream flow in the rivers and creeks due to lower precipitation levels.
The temperature of groundwater is often warmer than the air in winter, but cooler than the air in the
summer time. Maintenance of baseflow (or groundwater discharge) through the summer months is
critical to moderate the surface water temperatures, and also to sustain stream flow so aquatic species
are not confined to smaller habitat areas of the river or stream. Baseflow is of critical importance in the
winter months as the relatively warm groundwater discharges into the surface water features and
prevents the water from freezing, allowing various aquatic species to survive the winter months.
Decreasing the contribution of groundwater to surface water features may impact the spawning, rearing
and overwintering of various fish species, and as such, protecting the baseflow into rivers and creeks that
contain these coldwater fish species is considered critical.
Similarly, wetlands whose ecosystems are supported by groundwater discharge also need to be
protected to ensure long-term health of the ecosystem. The quantity of water, depth of water, depth to
the water table and timing of wetting and drying of a wetland (hydroperiod) are all factors that affect the
type of wetland and the maintenance of a wetland ecosystem.
2.3     WATER BUDGETS AND GROUNDWATER STORAGE
Water budgets in their simplest terms can be looked at for given area as water input, water output and the
change in water stored within that area:
                   Inputs = Outputs + change in storage
If there is no change in the storage of water (e.g. change in lake level or elevation of the water table) then
water input will be equal to water output. While the concept is simple, there are various components to
the water input and the water output.
Examples of water inputs to a groundwater system include:
     •    precipitation;
     •    surface water inflow;
     •    groundwater inflow from outside the area being assessed; and,
     •    anthropogenic (man-made) input such as leaky infrastructure (wastewater and water).
Examples of water outputs to a groundwater system include:
     •    evaporation and transpiration;
     •    surface water outflow;

 REVIEW OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE FOR THE WATERLOO AND PARIS/ GALT
MORAINES
     •   groundwater outflow from the area being assessed; and
     •   groundwater withdrawals from water supply wells.
 The change in storage in a given area can include:
     •   surface water reservoirs (e.g. lake levels);
     •   groundwater (i.e. fluctuation in the water table); and,
     •   soil moisture.
Figure 2.3.1 shows a schematic representation of water budget components, as presented in the
“ORMCP Technical Paper 10 – Water Budgets”. All of these components will not be described in detail
here. It is shown to illustrate the three different “compartments” of the water budget for a groundwater
system and inputs and outputs to each compartment.
A water budget is often conducted to examine the relationship between the input and output of water
within a specified region, and it is often used to examine the relationship between water supply (how
much do we have?) and water demand (how much are we using?). In other words it is used to determine
the sustainability of a water supply for a specific area. Water budgets are used to manage water
resources and help predict areas where there may be water shortages in the future.
The water budget calculation however does not address the issue of sustainability from an ecosystem
aspect (Bredehoeft et al, 1982; Bredehoeft, 2002; Devlin and Sophocleous, 2005). Sustainability from a
water supply perspective can be equated to capturing discharge (i.e. output) and using it for water supply
as the water is “lost” outside the system being assessed. Some or all of this water may be required to
sustain an ecosystem (i.e. wetlands, baseflow) and the sustainability of the ecosystem needs to be
factored into the water budget. Water needed to sustain the ecosystem has been identified in the Source
Protection Guidance Module 7, “Water Budget and Water Quantity Risk Assessment”, (MOE 2007). It is
recognized though, that actual quantification is a challenge.
One other component of the water budget assessment is the scale of the assessment and the
interconnection of the groundwater system within the area being assessed. Figure 2.3.2 shows a
“cartoon” example of different types of storage in an aquifer system to illustrate the variation in storage
when trying to develop a water budget. The aquifer system could be one large system such as a ‘bath
tub” in the illustration and water storage (and conversely water taking) water budget calculation can be
conducted for one large closed basin. In the case of the “egg carton”, there are a number of smaller
storage areas (e.g. smaller closed basins or aquifer systems) which may not be connected and a water
budget assessment must be done at a smaller case, rather than the entire “egg carton” (i.e. group of
unconnected aquifers). An understanding of the scale of the aquifer system and the hydraulic
connection(s) of the aquifer system is important when developing a water budget.

3.0        OVERVIEW OF WATERLOO AND PARIS/ GALT
           MORAINES
Prior to providing an overview of the Waterloo and Paris/ Galt Moraines the following sections are
presented to provide a general overview of moraines and the potential significance and functions of
moraines.
3.1      GEOLOGY OF MORAINES
The term “moraine” and the need to protect “moraines” have gained prominence in the Province of
Ontario since the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan was implemented in 2001. This is evident by
the current EBR applications and the concern to “protect” the Waterloo Moraine and the Paris/ Galt
Moraines. It was felt as part of this review that an overview of the geology of moraines should be
presented to gain a general understanding of geologic features known as moraines. This overview is not
meant to be all-encompassing or deal with various geological interpretations or issues related to
understanding the geological deposition of various types of moraines. There is a large volume of
information in the literature dealing with glaciers, glaciation and glacial landforms and many
interpretations and definitions of the glacial landforms which can not be captured in a higher level
overview such as presented below.
Glaciers carry and deposit a variety of geologic debris that is eroded from the landscape that the glaciers
move over. Some of this debris can be deposited along the edges (front and side) of the ice and some
can be deposited on top of or under the ice, as the ice melts. Some of these glacial deposits are called
moraines. A moraine can vary considerably in size, shape and geologic composition. There have been
extensive studies related to understanding the glacial history of southern Ontario and the depositional
history/environment of specific geological features or areas in southern Ontario. A complete overview of
the glacial periods in southern Ontario is presented by the Barnett in the OGS Special Volume on the
Geology of Ontario, 1992.
Ontario has been covered by ice sheets on several occasions over the last 70,000 years during the
Quaternary geology period. Glaciations during this period resulted in both the erosion and deposition of a
variety of unconsolidated geologic material (often referred to as overburden material). Deposition of the
material the glacier carries is in two primary forms: 1), direct deposition of glacial debris beneath the ice or
in front of the ice as the glacier retreats; and 2), fluvial deposition by streams flowing within the glacier or
meltwater flowing off the glacier.
Various types of deposits occurred during advance and retreat of different ice sheets. Unsorted
unstratified material laid down beneath the ice or dropped from the ice as the ice melts is known as till.
Tills are usually widespread deposits originating from the movement and retreat of large ice sheets or
lobes of ice. Numerous types of deposits also occur from the melting ice ranging from coarse sand and
gravel in glacial meltwater streams to silt and clay in glacial lakes.
The term moraine as defined in “Moraines”, Canadian Landscape Fact Sheets by Natural Resources
Canada (NRC) is:
“a mound, ridge, or other distinct accumulation of generally unsorted, unstratified glacial debris (called
till), deposited by the direct action of glacier ice. A moraine can take a variety of forms that are
independent of control by the surface on which it lies.”
A moraine is formed, as described in “Moraines” by NRC:

 REVIEW OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE FOR THE WATERLOO AND PARIS/ GALT
MORAINES
“Through the processes of plucking, abrasion, rocks falling from valley side walls, and a bull-dozing-like
action, a glacier collects unconsolidated (loose) debris and includes it in a mass of ice. This sediment,
made of rock particles of all different sizes, builds up at the front, sides, and base of the ice. The
sediment is brought towards the ice margin and is deposited as the ice melts”
Figure 3.1.1 shows a schematic series of figures depicting an example of moraine formation. There a
several types of moraines, identified on the basis of their shape and location in relation to the glacier.
The following types and descriptions, as taken directly from the NRC Fact Sheet, are relevant to the
current review:
End moraines are defined as; “a ridge-like accumulation of glacial debris that has been produced at the
lower or outer end of an actively flowing glacier.” (Note: the Paris and Galt Moraines are classified as end
moraines).
Kame moraines are defined as; “… an end moraine that contains numerous hummocky mounds of
irregularly bedded sand and gravel with subordinated till, deposited in patches from meltwater flowing in
contact with a moving or decaying glacier”.
Interlobate moraines were not listed in the NRC Fact Sheet, but can be described in the following way. If
large ice sheets advance irregularly so that their margins are “lobate”, the retreating margins of ice
deposit “terminal” moraines of boulders, clay and sand leaving the original interlobate shape of the
glacier(s), hence the term interlobate moraine. Ice sheets or ice lobes that have come in contact with
each other and then retreat will leave combined debris at the front of each lobe. As the ice melts there
may be a substantial deposition of debris from meltwater between the two ice lobes. (Note: The Waterloo
Moraine is interpreted as an interlobate moraine (Karrow, 1993).
Hummocky moraines are “areas of knob-and-kettle topography that may have been formed either along
an active ice front or around a mass of stagnant ice.” Knob-and-kettle topography is an undulating
landscape in which a disordered assemblage of knolls, mounds, or ridges of glacial debris is interspersed
with irregular depressions and pits (kettles) that are commonly undrained and may contain swamps or
ponds.
It is obvious from the above noted descriptions that moraines contain a wide variety of geologic material
ranging from coarse sand and gravel with boulders to silt and clay and can be unsorted or well sorted
material. Moraines can also be composed of flow or “meltout” tills that contain lesser amounts of
stratified sand and gravel.
The structure and composition of moraines are a function of their depositional environment and the
underlying geological material that the glacier is moving over. Moraines can vary widely in areal extent,
height and thickness. They can be prominent topographic features or be low-lying or buried by younger
sediments. The various glacial advances and retreats in southern Ontario, especially from the different
ice lobes originating from Lake Huron-Georgian Bay and Lake Ontario-Lake Erie, has resulted in a series
of moraine deposits throughout southwestern Ontario. Figure 3.1.1 shows the distribution of moraines
throughout southwestern Ontario (Barnett, 1992).
3.2     FUNCTION AND SIGNIFICANCE OF MORAINES
Moraines are often cited for their significance in providing many functions to the environment (e.g. Sharpe
and Russell, 2005; ROW, 2005). Each moraine will have its own unique functions depending on the size,
structure and location of it. There are a number of characteristics or functions that are often associated
with larger more extensive moraines throughout southern Ontario and other parts of the Great Lakes
basin. Characteristics or functions could include the following:

      •  They are often high relief areas, therefore they are often at the top end of a groundwater flow
         system.

         recharge is often provided to the groundwater system, compared to other geologic landforms.
      •  They often provide substantial quantities of water to municipalities and private users.
      •  As a result of the high relief and recharge, larger moraines often contain the headwaters of
         streams, which in turn provide substantial baseflow to maintain flows streams and rivers during
         drier times.
      •  The nature of the deposition of the geologic material (e.g. melting ice trapped in the glacial
         debris) often results in small closed depressions (i.e. no external runoff), potentially creating
         areas of locally increased infiltration and/or local wetland areas.
      •  The high relief areas of larger moraines are often more vegetated and less conducive to
         agricultural practices. This potentially creates an area with a greater and more diverse natural
         habitat.
      •  They can be a major source of aggregate.
Some moraines have been cited by the OGS, GSC and Conservation Authorities (e.g. Bajc and Shirota,
2007; and GRCA, 2008) as providing considerable recharge to the groundwater system in local areas.
Recharge is an important component of the hydrologic function of a specific area. As indicated in Section
2.2.1, the three most important physical features that control the hydrologic function of a specific area or
landform are:
      •  topographic relief;
      •  composition of the geologic material (i.e. highly permeability or low permeability material); and,
      •  drainage system connections (open or closed depressions).
It is important to note that many geologic features (e.g. outwash deposits or sand plains) can have a
significant hydrologic function (e.g. high rate of recharge), however moraines are more likely to have a
higher topographic relief and/or closed depressions, due to the nature of their formation and deposition as
discussed in Section 2.1. Both of these features, where present, can increase the significance of the
hydrologic function of a moraine.
Examples of the significance of each of these physical features and the impact on the hydrologic function
are presented below.
Topographic Relief
The topographic relief of a moraine potentially influences three main factors related to the hydrologic
function:
      •  the volume of water that can be stored within the moraine;
      •  the height of water in the geologic landform that “drives” the vertical and lateral movement of
         groundwater; and,
      •  the location of potential headwaters of surface water systems.
Figure 3.2.1 shows several examples to illustrate the influence of topographic relief on the water regime.
Figure 3.2.1a shows an example of a moraine with a low topographic relief. In this setting, there is a

MORAINES
minor volume of water “stored” within the core of the moraine. The water level is not much higher than
the surrounding area, so groundwater flow may be local, travelling only a short distance before
discharging to local headwater streams. Figure 3.2.1b shows an example of a moraine with high
topographic relief. In this case the water infiltrating into the ground has mounded up within the core of the
moraine. There is a considerably greater volume of water stored in within the core of the moraine,
compared to a moraine with low relief. The height of the water table also creates a greater pressure,
“pushing” the water deeper, with some water moving to a more regional groundwater flow system (as
discussed in Section 2). Springs and headwater streams will also occur at a higher topographic relief.
Composition of the Geologic Material
The composition of geologic units underlying the moraine, or present within the moraine structure, will
influence:
     •   the rate at which water will infiltrate into the groundwater system;
     •   the depth to which water may recharge the groundwater system; and,
     •   the location of areas where groundwater may discharge.
Figure 3.2.2 shows some examples of the influence of geologic materials on the water regime. The
figure shows three examples of water movement influenced by the composition of geologic material
present. In Area 1 where there is impervious material, much of the precipitation does not recharge the
groundwater system and becomes surface runoff. In Area 2, where the geologic material is generally
highly permeable to depth, precipitation recharges the groundwater system and could migrate deeper in
the groundwater flow system, until a low permeability geologic unit is encountered. In Area 3, the upper
geologic material is permeable and most precipitation recharges the groundwater system. However,
there is a low permeability geologic unit at a shallow depth that impedes much of the recharge water from
moving downward. This water discharges to the surface water system at springs or headwater streams at
a higher elevation than in Area 1.
Drainage Systems Connections
Drainage system connections at ground surface are a function of the local topographic relief. In areas
where they are connected along the ground surface (e.g. connected swales) water will flow through them,
eventually reaching a surface water course. If the surficial soils are permeable some water may recharge
the underlying groundwater system through infiltration. If there are local closed depressions where there
is no topographic outlet, then water precipitation will be stored in these areas (both rainfall and snowmelt)
and this water will either infiltrate, be used by local plants or will evaporate. Drainage system connections
influence:
     •   the volume and timing of surface water runoff;
     •   the volume and rate of recharge to the groundwater system; and,
     •   the development of wetlands and maintenance of local soil moisture conditions.
Figure 3.2.3 shows an example of the influence of drainage system connections. In areas where closed
depressions exist, there is a greater recharge potential to the groundwater system. In areas where the
drainage is open there is a predominant surface run off component.

3.3     OVERVIEW OF THE WATERLOO MORAINE
This section provides a general overview of the Waterloo Moraine and a relatively detailed description of
the history of investigations of the Waterloo Moraine. It is not meant to be an exhaustive review, with a
detailed discussion of each investigation, but it is meant to provide a “sense” of the level of investigations
and research that has been carried out within the area of the Waterloo Moraine since a water supply well
was first established within the Waterloo Moraine more than 100 years ago. Notwithstanding the study
team’s collective experience in investigations of the Waterloo Moraine, the volume of technical material
available from various sources was still found to be overwhelming and it is hoped that this section
captures the extent of investigations that have been conducted to date or are currently being carried out.
It is noted here that for simplicity of presentation and general discussion within this report, well fields or
water supply wells within the geographic area of the Waterloo Moraine will be referenced as being in the
Waterloo Moraine. Technically, some water supply wells are found within the Waterloo Moraine
sediments while other water supply wells are found within aquifers below the Waterloo Moraine
sediments, but within the geographic area of the Waterloo Moraine.
          3.3.1    General Physical Setting
The Waterloo Moraine is located within the central area of the Grand River watershed as show in Figure
3.3.1. The Waterloo Moraine is approximately 400 km2 in size. The central area of the Grand River basin
has numerous moraine features, with 14 individual moraines identified (GRCA Watershed
Characterization Report, January, 2008) as shown in Figure 3.3.1.
The topographic elevation of the Waterloo Moraine varies from a high of 430 mAMSL in the northern
portion of the moraine to a low of about 325 mAMSL in the southeast portion, near New Dundee (Figure
3.3.2). The Waterloo Moraine is the dominant topographic feature in the area, trending in a general
northwest-southeast direction. The topography of the Waterloo Moraine consists of gently rolling to
undulating hills, with local areas of pronounced relief in the central area of the moraine and flatter less
pronounced relief along the flanks of the moraine. The “crest” of the Waterloo Moraine generally follows
the municipal boundary between the urban area of Kitchener-Waterloo and the Township of Wilmot.
The entire area of the Waterloo Moraine is within the Grand River watershed. Drainage is primarily from
local tributaries, with drainage to the Grand River in the east and to the Nith River in the west, as shown
in Figure 3.3.3. Local tributaries originating within the Waterloo Moraine and draining directly to the
Grand River include Laurel Creek in the northeast portion of the Waterloo Moraine and Schneider and
Strasburg creek in the southeast. Much of the central core area of the moraine is drained by Alder
Creek, southward to the Nith River. The western portion of the Waterloo Moraine is drained by several
other tributaries of the Nith River, including Bamberg Creek in the northwest, and Baden Creek and
Hunsburger Creek in the southwest.
Local drainage is highly variable ranging from good to poor, depending on the surficial soils and local
topography (Clarkson, 1991). In some areas tile drainage is required due to low relief and low
permeability surficial soils. In many areas, in particular in the central or core area of the Waterloo
Moraine, the soils are coarse and very well-drained.
Figure 3.3.4 shows the thickness of the overburden in the area of the Waterloo Moraine. The overburden
sediments range in thickness from 120 m in the central area of the Waterloo Moraine to 30 m in the
river/creek valleys along the flanks of the moraine, with a typical thickness of 60 to 80 m in the core area,
and a thickness of 40-60 m along the flanks of the Waterloo Moraine.

          3.3.2   Investigations of the Waterloo Moraine
The first geological investigation of the Waterloo Moraine was almost 100 years ago with the installation
of the first municipal water supply for the City of Kitchener. The following sections provide a summary of
the history of investigations since that time. The summary has been divided into three sections: historical
geological investigations up to the mid-1980’s; historical water supply investigations up to the 1980’s;
and, combined broader based hydrogeological and geologic investigations of the Waterloo Moraine since
the late 1980’s.
3.3.2.1 Historical Geological Investigations
The Waterloo Moraine was named by Taylor (1913), as part of his studies of moraines of southwestern
Ontario. According to Bajc and Karrow (2004), Taylor was the first to recognize the Waterloo Moraine as
an interlobate feature “deposited along the retreating margin of the Lake Erie ice lobe” in an area referred
to as the Ontario Island. Figure 3.3.5, adapted from Chapman and Putman (1984), shows the recession
of the Wisconsinan glacier. Figure 3.3.5a shows the position of the Waterloo Moraine during the early
retreat of the ice lobes and Figure 3.3.5b shows the opening of the “Ontario Island” with a further retreat
of the ice. A simplified version of the location of the ice lobes that resulted in the formation of the
Waterloo Moraine is shown in Figure 3.3.6 (from Morgan 2005).
Taylor (1913) described the Waterloo Moraine as a “finely formed moraine running south from Waterloo to
Ayr and west to Bamberg” and also described it as “higher and more bulky than average”. Little
additional work was done until Chapman and Putman (1943), conducted further work on moraines of
Southern Ontario. In 1951 Chapman and Putman refined the geographic extent and character of the
Waterloo Moraine (Bajc and Karrow, 2004) as they described the moraine as an oblong tract of hills
composed of sandy till with lesser amounts of kame sand and gravel. They noted a considerable amount
of fine sand within the central area of the moraine, becoming finer-textured towards the south.
The Waterloo Moraine was originally interpreted to be deposited during the last glaciation, however work
by Karrow in the late 1960’s and early 1970’s (e.g. Karrow 1974) interpreted the Waterloo Moraine to be a
palimpsest feature. A palimpsest feature is a feature that reflects earlier periods of glaciation, older than
the most recent ice advances. As a result, many of the depositional features are obscured by younger
sediments deposited on top of the feature.
Many of the earliest detailed investigations of the Waterloo Moraine were conducted by Karrow as part of
the Quaternary mapping of southwestern Ontario (Karrow, 1963 and 1968). Most of the work involved
mapping of the exposed stratigraphy in road cuts, river valleys and gravel pits. This work was supported
by a single partially cored borehole, drilled in the Waterloo Moraine in the late 1960’s by Canada Public
Works (Isherwood, 1976). Karrow noted at the time that the Waterloo Moraine had a fine sand and gravel
core and was only locally capped by deposits of fine-grained till. There were several interpretations of the
formation and the deposition of Waterloo Moraine during this period, including Karrow’s work and work by
Harris, 1970. At that time Karrow concluded that the history of the Waterloo Moraine could not be
understood until an extensive deep drilling program was undertaken (Gautrey, 1996).
Figure 3.3.7 shows the surficial geology in the area of the Waterloo Moraine as interpreted by Karrow,
1993. The central area of the Waterloo Moraine was interpreted as ice-contact sand and gravel, while the
flanks of the moraine were interpreted to be primarily silty clay till units at ground surface. The
understanding of the Quaternary geology in the area of the Waterloo Moraine up to the 1980’s can be
summarized from work by Karrow (Karrow, 1987 and Karrow, 1993) as follows.

MORAINES
Ontario has been covered by ice sheets on several occasions over the last two million years. However,
much of the glaciation that shaped the geology of southern Ontario occurred during the late-Wisconsinan
period of glaciation, in the last 23,000 years. Although some pre-late-Wisconsinan Quaternary deposits
exist the majority of glacial deposits are from the late-Wisconsinan period. The late-Wisconsinan period
of glaciation featured three main periods: the Nissouri, Port Bruce and Port Huron stadials (colder periods
of glaciation with ice advancing) separated by the Erie and Mackinaw interstadials (warmer periods of
glaciation with ice retreating).
Ice lobes originating from the lake basins of Lake Huron and Georgian Bay, Lake Ontario and Lake Erie
(Figure 3.3.6) came together in the general area of the Region of Waterloo. Advance and retreat of
these ice lobes over the Region resulted in a complex deposition of various types of glacial features. The
general understanding of the stratigraphy of the area of the Waterloo Moraine is shown in Figure 3.3.8
(from Gautrey, 1996). As shown in Figure 3.3.8, a number of the tills were deposited from the advance
and retreat of the Huron-Georgian Bay ice lobe and a number deposited from the advance and retreat of
the Ontario Erie ice lobe.
One of the most prominent till units in area of the Waterloo Moraine is the Catfish Creek Till, which is
widespread throughout southern Ontario. It is a stony sandy silt till to silt till and is extremely dense.
Some glaciolacustrine and glaciofluvial sand and gravel units (potential aquifers) are associated with the
Catfish Creek Till sequence of geologic units. Several till units were deposited over a large portion of the
Waterloo Moraine area as ice sheets fluctuated in size and areal extent from both the Ontario-Erie lobe
and Huron-Georgian Bay lobe. The three most prominent tills deposited were the Maryhill Till and the
younger Tavistock and Port Stanley Tills. The Maryhill Till and Port Stanley Till were deposited by the
Ontario-Erie ice lobe. The Tavistock Till was deposited by the Huron-Georgian Bay Ice lobe. The
Maryhill Till is characterized as a clay till, and plays an important role in the water resources of the
Waterloo Moraine. Where present, the Maryhill Till protects the lower aquifers from surface
contamination, however it also limits recharge to the lower aquifers. The Tavistock and Port Stanley Tills
are characterized as silty clay to clayey silt tills. Where present at or near ground surface, these tills will
also provide some protection to underlying aquifers and limit recharge.
During various retreats of the ice lobes, sand and gravel was deposited between some of the till units.
Some of these deposits were interpreted to be continuous over a large area while other deposits were
more localized. These deposits form the major aquifers of the Waterloo Moraine area. The depositional
sequence of these units and the relationship with the till units was historically not well understood due to
limited good geological information at depth.
During the 1980s additional groundwater research was being conducted (see next section) and
Quaternary geology investigations were also being conducted to obtain additional information on the
subsurface geology. This additional work was spearheaded, in part, by Dr. Robert Farvolden, at the
University of Waterloo. Dr. Farvolden was instrumental in developing the hydrogeology program at the
University of Waterloo in the 1970s. During the 1970s the Region of Waterloo was looking at the long-
term potential of building a pipeline to one of the Great Lakes, based on 25-year forecasts of water
demand due to predicted population growth forecasts for the Region of Waterloo. Dr. Farvolden felt that
given the high cost of the pipeline, more effort should be taken in understanding the water resources of
the Region of Waterloo (Farvolden, 1981). He felt that there were significant additional water resources
available; however politicians did not want to spend money to “study” the geology of the area. He stated:
“Many informed geologists and engineers believe that additional groundwater supplies are available, and
perhaps sufficient to meet the forecast demands. The key factor in a technical solution is better data on
the Quaternary stratigraphy. Funds have not been made available for basic stratigraphic studies using

modern techniques and as a consequence hydrogeology cannot be used effectively in dealing with the
problem.”
Based partly on Dr. Farvolden’s comments, new research programs were initiated. The Quaternary
geology research during that time focused on the subsurface geology beneath the urban areas of
Waterloo and Kitchener and included the following studies:

         Geophysics, Final Report, O.G.R.F., Project 128.
This work provided some additional understanding of the complex glacial history in the Region of
Waterloo. The understanding of the depositional environment and sedimentary structure of the Waterloo
Moraine area was not further advanced until an extensive drilling program and other field investigations
commenced in the 1990s. The increased investigation was primarily the result of a groundwater
contamination issue in the Region in 1989/1990, which created an increased the need to understand the
water resources from a geologic perspective. Those investigations are discussed in Section 3.3.2.3.
3.3.2.2 Historical Water Supply Investigations
Figure 3.3.9 shows the location of existing municipal wells or well fields located within the geographic
area of the Waterloo Moraine. The first wells were constructed in 1899 at the Greenbrook well field. The
majority of exploration was conducted between the late 1940s and early 1970s. Investigations were
conducted independently for the Kitchener Water Commission and the Waterloo Public Utilities
Commission. The Region of Waterloo was incorporated in 1973 and assumed responsibility for the
municipal water supply systems throughout the Region, including Kitchener, Waterloo, Cambridge and
the four surrounding townships.
Historically, water supply investigations generally consisted of a test drilling program to determine the
extent of water bearing sand and gravel units. Typically, a test hole was drilled and a well installed if
suitable “aquifer” material was encountered. A pumping test was conducted to determine the potential
water yield of the local aquifer unit. In areas where there appeared to be considerable water, or the sand
and gravel appeared to be extensive, additional testing was conducted and additional production wells
were installed if warranted. Early drilling was primarily in the urban areas of Kitchener and Waterloo, and
expanded outward, typically westward, as each municipality expanded.
Rapid industrial expansion in the area in the 1960s resulted in an increase in exploration for new water
sources. The first interpretative study, combining historical information from previous exploration
programs and data from water supply wells, was undertaken in 1963 by the Ontario Water Resources
Commission (prior to the formation of the Ontario Ministry of the Environment). During this study three
aquifers were identified throughout the area, with aquitard units separating these aquifers.
In the early 1970s this study was expanded by International Water Supply (Dixon, 1973). Dixon
conducted the first major regional study of the water supply for the Kitchener-Waterloo area. Dixon

assessed the multi-aquifer system throughout Kitchener and Waterloo and interpreted the aquifers to be
relatively continuous over most of the Region. There appeared to be an area of thick sands and gravels
to the west of the urban centres (what has been previously described in this report as the central or core
area of the Waterloo Moraine) and deeper sands and gravels under the urban centres, below several till
units. As part of the Dixon study, one of the earliest groundwater flow models in the province was
developed by Dr. Emil Frind at the University of Waterloo. This led to a greater involvement of the
University of Waterloo in groundwater resource studies throughout the Region of Waterloo.
As the hydrogeology program at the University of Waterloo expanded in the late 1970s and early 1980s
the focus of local investigations shifted to understanding the hydrogeology of the well fields across
broader areas of the Waterloo Moraine through the development of “hydrostratigraphic” models.
Hydrostratigraphy is simply the defining of laterally extensive geologic units on the basis of their hydraulic
properties, typically dividing geologic units into aquifers (water bearing formations) and aquitards
(formations that impede the movement of water).
The following highlights the various research studies and water resources investigations that were
conducted prior to 1989/1990, when a groundwater contamination issue triggered a substantially different
approach to understanding and protecting groundwater resources with the Region of Waterloo (discussed
in Section 3.3.2.3). Research studies included the following:

3.3.2.3 Recent Investigations of the Waterloo Moraine
Water Resource Investigations and Protection Strategies
In 1989 groundwater contamination was discovered in a municipal well field in the Town of Elmira (north
of Waterloo). Due to general concerns regarding water quality and the impacts of groundwater
contamination, the Region of Waterloo initiated the development of a comprehensive water resources
protection strategy. In 1992, a Comprehensive Water Resources Protection Strategy was developed to
manage and protect groundwater resources within the Region from both existing and new potential
sources of contamination. In 1994, Regional Council approved a “Water Resources Protection
Strategy Implementation Plan” that established a ten-year program for groundwater and surface water
management activities. Eight separate elements of the implementation plan were recognized. The first
element of the strategy was “Water Resources Definition”.
Several Water Resources Definition studies were prioritized, including the following:
    •    Waterloo North Aquifer System Study, 1992 by Terraqua Investigations Limited. This was the
         first groundwater resource definition study initiated by the Region. The area encompassed
         portion of the Waterloo Moraine within the City of Waterloo and the Laurel Creek Watershed. The
         City of Waterloo, the Grand River Conservation Authority and other stakeholders had just initiated
         a comprehensive study to integrate environmentally responsible land use planning into urban
         expansion of the City of Waterloo in the western portion of the City, within the Laurel Creek
         watershed (see the Laurel Creek Watershed Study below). The study introduced an ecosystem
         approach to long-term land use planning. An extensive geologic and hydrogeologic investigation
         was conducted looking at: the extent of hydraulic connection of the various aquifer units; the
         determination of recharge areas for the Waterloo North well field; and, groundwater/surface water
         interaction throughout the watershed.
    •    The Study of the Hydrogeology of the Waterloo Moraine, completed in 1995, by Terraqua
         Investigations Ltd. The objective of the study was to “define the hydrogeology of the Waterloo
         Moraine in accordance with the Regional Municipality of Waterloo Water Resources Protection
         Strategy goals”. There were five main study objectives as listed in Terraqua, 1995:
               o  delineation of major aquifer and aquitard units;
               o  definition of regional recharge areas;
               o  estimation of well field capture zones and existing risks to potential contamination
                  sources;
               o  estimation of impacts from municipal pumping on water levels; and,
               o  recommendations.
Investigations included drilling 25 continuously sampled boreholes, installing monitoring wells in the three
main aquifer units, conducting well field shut downs and pumping tests, obtaining water quality data and

developed using geological data, pumping test data and water quality/isotope data (Terraqua, 1995).
Figure 3.3.11 shows the conceptual hydrogeological cross-section through the Waterloo Moraine as
developed from the Terraqua, 1995 study. The three aquifer system was further interpreted by trying to
relate the hydrostratigraphy to the Quaternary geology.
The study also presented an initial interpretation of the major recharge area within the Waterloo Moraine,
as shown in Figure 3.3.12. The recharge area was generally interpreted to be in the core area of the
Waterloo Moraine, in areas of higher topographic relief where ice-contact sand and gravel was mapped at
the ground surface. The recharge area generally corresponded to the areas of highest water table, as
show in Figure 3.3.13. Groundwater is shown to flow generally radially out from the recharge area in a
west, south and east direction.
Quaternary Geology Initiatives
During this time, the water resources definition studies were being conducted in co-operation with
Quaternary geology research. Many high quality boreholes were being drilled as part of these
investigations. Most boreholes were continuously cored and geophysical logged and in many cases
drilled to bedrock to obtain a complete geologic profile to aid in the geologic interpretation of the Waterloo
Moraine and the underlying geologic units. The following Quaternary geology research projects were
conducted during this time:
      •    Paloschi, G. 1993. Subsurface Stratigraphy of the Waterloo Moraine. M.Sc. Project, University
           of Waterloo.
      •    Rajakaruna, N. 1994. The Waterloo Moraine Project Phase 1: Subsurface Stratigraphy of
           western Kitchener-Waterloo. M.Sc. Project Report, University of Waterloo.
      •    Gautrey, S. 1996. The Hydrostratigraphy of the Waterloo Moraine. M.Sc. Thesis, University of
           Waterloo
These studies resulted in the development of a more detailed correlation of the aquifer and aquitard units
with the Quaternary stratigraphy and the chronology of deposition of various geologic units. Four major
till units were recognized within the Waterloo Moraine, correlating with the four aquitard units used in the
Region’s stratigraphic interpretation. Figure 3.3.14 shows the location of a series of hydrostratigraphic
cross-sections developed by Gautrey (1996) as part of his research. Figure 3.3.15 shows one of these
cross-sections (Section 3) through the Waterloo Moraine. Gautrey (1996) correlated the upper two
aquitard units with the upper and lower Maryhill Till, Aquitard 3 with the Catfish Creek Till and Aquitard 4,
where present, with the Canning Till and other associated sediments.
The following is noted with respect to the interpreted cross-section in Figure 3.3.15:
      •    an extensive thickness of sand and gravel in the core area of the moraine;
      •    an increased thickness of surficial till, moving eastward from the core of the moraine;
      •    few continuous lower aquifer units in the core area of the Waterloo Moraine;

    •    a generally continuous unit of lower Maryhill Till, however where thin or absent could create a
         potential connection from the upper aquifer to the lower aquifers;
    •    a thinning of the upper sand unit (Aquifer 1), moving eastward away from the core of the Waterloo
         Moraine (toward the urban area); and,
    •    an increasing presence of lower aquifer material moving eastward from the core of the moraine,
         resulting in a more complex local stratigraphy at depth.
Recent Investigations
Numerous other research projects were conducted during the 1990’s and early 2000’s to refine the
understanding of the hydrogeology of the Waterloo Moraine, or specific portions of it, as well as
conducting more detailed work to manage and protect the aquifer systems as part of the Region’s Water
Resources Protection Strategy. These investigations included but were not limited to the following:

         Thesis, University of Waterloo.
    •    Martin, P. 1994. Modeling of the North Waterloo Multi-Aquifer System. M.Sc. Thesis, University

         Moraine. Prepared for the Region of Waterloo.
The primary advancement of the understanding of the Waterloo Moraine during this time was the
development of a groundwater flow model and the delineation of capture zones for well fields within the
Waterloo Moraine. The Region developed a groundwater flow model for the Waterloo Moraine (WHI,
2000) to more completely understand, manage and protect the aquifer system within the Waterloo
Moraine. The Waterloo Moraine Model developed by Martin and Frind (1998) was updated to develop
three-dimensional capture zones for well fields within the Waterloo Moraine. The groundwater flow
system was modelled using the previously interpreted multi-aquifer system of three aquifers and four
aquitards. The model was calibrated to water levels in each of the aquifers and baseflow in the surface
water system at locations within the area of the model boundary. Figure 3.3.16 to Figure 3.3.19 show
the calibrated water levels for the water table and each of three aquifer units. The general groundwater
flow system is similar for all aquifers with flow in a northwest to southeast direction, following the general
topography, with major flow components diverging toward the Nith River in the west and Grand River in
the east. Locally, there is groundwater flow from Aquifer 1 discharging to a number of the creeks, as
evident for example to Alder Creek, which flows through New Dundee (Figure 3.3.17). Locally,
groundwater flow is impacted by pumping of the well fields as shown by the water level contours
wrapping around the Greenbrook, Parkway and Strasburg well fields for Aquifer 3 (Figure 3.3.19).

Figure 3.3.20 shows the location of wells and well fields in the Waterloo Moraine, for which capture
zones were developed. Figure 3.3.21 shows the 2-year and 10-year Time-of-Travel (ToT) capture zones

year and 10-year ToT capture zones for the Greenbrook well field. Larger scale mapping was prepared
for the 2-year and 10-year ToT capture zones for all well fields.
Environmental Studies and Initiatives
In addition to studies related to water resources protection the Region of Waterloo was undergoing a
number of environmental studies and initiatives related to ecosystem-based planning (ROW, 2005b). The
Region of Waterloo developed their first Regional Official Policies Plan (ROPP) in 1976, which sought to
balance land use, environment, infrastructure and social factors in decision making. The 1976 ROPP
was, according to the Region (ROW, 2005b): “the first plan in Ontario to designate environmentally
sensitive areas and enact policies intended to evaluate and minimize impacts of proposed new
developments on ESPAs). The ROPP was updated in 1985 and again in 1995 (Note: it is currently being
updated and is in Draft form for review as discussed later in Section 5.4.3.). The 1995 ROPP promoted
an ecosystem-based planning approach to development and growth. The 1995 ROPP established a
Natural Habitat Network (RMOW, 2005b) consisting of:
     •   Environmental Preservation Areas (EPAs);
     •   Environmentally Sensitive Policy Areas (ESPAs);
     •   Provincially Significant Wetlands (PSWs);
     •   significant valley lands;
     •   sensitive groundwater recharge areas and discharge areas;
     •   headwaters;
     •   aquifers;
     •   significant woodlands;
     •   locally significant natural areas;
     •   significant wildlife habitat; and,
     •   significant fish habitat.
In order to establish or map these features a number of environmentally-related studies have been
conducted over the years, ranging from Region-wide ESPA studies and wetland evaluations to area-
specific subwatershed studies. The Region, GRCA and local municipalities require subwatershed studies
to be conducted in areas of new development or growth. These studies have been on-going since 1989.
Subwatershed studies provide an ecosystem-based approach to land use planning on a subwatershed
scale. They integrate groundwater and surface water, aquatic and terrestrial habitat and fisheries
creating a broader understanding of the function and linkage of the natural systems. Subwatershed
studies require more detailed assessments of these features to identify and protect them from adverse
impacts of potential land use changes or land use activities. One of the first detailed subwatershed
studies in Ontario was the Laurel Creek Watershed Study.
The Laurel Creek Watershed Study was initiated in 1991 due to concerns about development on the west
side of the City of Waterloo, which is located within the central area of the Laurel Creek subwatershed
(Figure 3.3.3). Studies were conducted to: identify existing environmental and water resources
February 2009                                 FINAL REPORT                                              21

conditions; identify impacts due to existing land use activities; assess the potential for impacts related to
possible future land use change scenarios; and, develop a management strategy for the subwatershed.
A hydrogeological study was conducted (Terraqua, 1993) to assess groundwater flow and aquifer
systems, groundwater/surface water interaction, baseflow and recharge areas as well as the groundwater
contribution to ecological features such as wetlands and fisheries. The watershed encompasses much of
the north central portion of the Waterloo Moraine as it includes the Clair Creek, Beaver Creek and
Monastery Creek tributaries of Laurel Creek (see Figure 3.3.3 for locations).
Since the completion of the Laurel Creek Watershed Study, there have been a number of other
subwatershed studies within the area of the Waterloo Moraine including the following (see Figure 3.3.3
for the locations of the creek systems):
     •   Strasburg Creek, 1989 and 1996 (southeast portion of the Waterloo Moraine);
     •   Doon South, 1994 (southeast portion of the Waterloo Moraine);
     •   Blair Bechtel Bauman Creeks, 1997 (South portion of the Waterloo Moraine);
     •   Alder Creek, 2008 (central portion of the Waterloo Moraine); and,
     •   Cedar Creek, on-going (south portion of the Waterloo Moraine)
As well, additional studies have been conducted on Baden Creek and Hunsberger Creek (southwest
portion of the Waterloo Moraine) as part of an assessment looking at the impacts of water taking from the
Wilmot Well Field located within the Hunsberger Creek subwatershed. Water level data and surface flows
have been collected in this area since 1969, when the Wilmot Well Field was first developed.
Post Walkerton - Recent Source Protection Initiatives
As part of the recommendations of the O’Connor Report, (O’Connor, 2002), from the Walkerton Inquiry,
the provincial government legislated watershed-based source protection plans. The O’Connor Report
contained 121 recommendations for protection of drinking water in Ontario. Since the release of the
report and recommendations the Government of Ontario has introduced legislation to safeguard drinking
water from the source to the tap. The Clean Water Act (CWA) was passed in 2006 and provides a
framework to develop local source protection plans. The CWA focuses on the protection of municipal
drinking water supplies. Multi-stakeholders (e.g. MOE, MNR, Conservation Authorities, municipalities)
are working in partnership to develop local science-based source protection plans.
The ability to develop and implement a source protection plan requires a sound understanding of the local
geological and hydrogeological conditions. As part of the development of source protection plans new
geological investigation initiatives were developed. Based on the need to provide a better understanding
of three-dimensional interpretation of Quaternary deposits, the Ontario Geological Survey (OGS)
embarked on a new program designed to provide basic geoscience information for the protection and
preservation of provincial groundwater resources (Bajc and Newton, 2005). A pilot project of three-
dimensional mapping of Quaternary deposits within Waterloo Region was initiated in 2002 as part of this
geoscience initiative. The initiative was done in co-operation with the Geological Survey of Canada
(GSC), the Region of Waterloo, University of Waterloo and the Grand River Conservation Authority. The
primary objectives of the study were: 1), to develop protocols for 3-dimensional mapping of Quaternary
deposits in Ontario; and 2), characterize in 3-dimensions the geometry of the subsurface Quaternary
deposits in the Region of Waterloo.
The project is one of several studies currently being undertaken within southern Ontario as part of the
OGS’s groundwater mapping program, a provincially-mandated directive to study groundwater resources

within the province (Bajc and Karrow, 2004). The OGS project has been ongoing for about 5 years and
has supplemented previous work with the following (from Bajc, 2005; and, Bajc and Shirota, 2007):
     •    over a 1000 new surface and borehole log sections;
     •    16 km of ground penetrating radar;
     •    17km of seismic reflection profiling;
     •    continuous coring to bedrock at 13 sites;
     •    borehole geophysics;
     •    update and interpretation of the existing borehole and geophysical database with 22,952 data
          sets;
     •    use of 3-dimensional data mapping software to interpret the sub-surface geology;
     •     interpretation and creation of a fully attributed three-dimensional block model showing major
          aquifer and aquitards within Quaternary deposits in the Region of Waterloo; and,
     •    Interpretation and generation of aquifer recharge and susceptibility mapping based on the current
          OGS-constructed geologic model.
Since the release of the O’Connor report the Region of Waterloo has been actively updating their water
resources protection plan, to comply with the MOE Guidance Documents developed for source
protection. This source protection work is summarized in Section 5.8.
3.4     OVERVEW OF THE PARIS/ GALT MORAINES
In terms of assessing the geological and hydrogeological information available for the Paris/ Galt Moraine
system a number of relevant and inherent circumstances exist. Where the Paris/ Galt Moraines stretch
through the Credit River and Grand River watersheds they basically form headwater divides of the
majority of subwatersheds within the two watersheds. The exceptions are the Mill Creek and Eramosa
River-Blue Springs Creek subwatersheds, where the Paris/ Galt Moraines are present throughout the
subwatersheds. There are few municipal wells and very little urban development within these moraines.
As a result there have not been any moraine-focused hydrogeological studies, with the exception of
studies within the Mill Creek and Eramosa River-Blue Springs Creek subwatersheds. The Ontario
Geological Survey (OGS) has carried out a drilling program to map Quaternary deposits and potential
aquifers in the Brantford-Woodstock area, which includes a portion of the Paris/ Galt Moraine (Bajc, 2006,
2007, 2008b), but again this is a very limited area.
          3.4.1    General Physical Setting
The recognition of the Paris/ Galt Moraine system in various literature has it extending from an area in the
vicinity of Caledon, in the northeast, to an area southwest of Port Rowan on the Lake Erie shoreline, a
distance of approximately 150 kilometres (Figure 3.4.1.1). The Paris/ Galt Moraines are usually found
close together, with the Galt Moraine found on the southeasterly side of the Paris Moraine.
The Paris/ Galt Moraines are generally found as hummocky belts or ridges (Chapman and Putnam, 1984).
Their combined width can be up to 8 km (southeast of Guelph) or they can be present as faint surficial
ridges that eventually disappear (e.g. the Paris area and south towards Lake Erie). The topographic relief

MORAINES
of these moraines, above the adjacent till or outwash plains, can be as great as 30-40m in Guelph and
Caledon areas.
In some areas, the moraines are not separated (Guelph area) and in other areas they may be separated
by up to 10 km (northwest of Waterford). The moraines are not always coincident or continuous
throughout their 150 km length. Notably the Galt Moraine is absent in the Caledon area (White, 1975)
and the Paris Moraine is not continuous or is buried in the Cambridge area (Karrow, 1987). Throughout
the moraine belt, from Paris southward, the surficial expression of both moraines are quite discontinuous
(Cowan 1972; Barnett 1978, 1982, 1998) and are interpreted to be buried by glaciolacustrine deposits
within this area (Bajc, 2008a). This lack of continuity can be seen in Figure 3.4.1.1.
A substantial amount of outwash sand and gravel is associated with the Paris/ Galt Moraine system in the
form of both outwash plains and spillways. These outwash features may exist adjacent to the flanks of the
moraines (e.g. southeast of Erin and Cambridge) or can be found in between the moraines (e.g. Puslinch)
and can be readily seen on the surficial geology map (Figure 3.4.1.2).
The topography of the moraines provides the relief for the headwaters of a large number of streams
(Figure 3.4.1.3). Coldwater streams are quite common, given the related permeable outwash deposits
and, as will be discussed later, given the potential for more permeable material within the moraines.
The ice contact nature of the moraines provided opportunities for kettles and kettle lakes to form (e.g.
Puslinch Lake). These kettle features, along with the general hummocky nature of the moraines, give rise
to many local wetland features. Wetland features are quite common adjacent to moraines where runoff
from the slopes may collect (Figure 3.4.1.4).
The Paris/ Galt Moraines overlie a number of bedrock units throughout the study area (Figure 3.4.1.5)
and will be discussed later as they relate aquifer potential.
Agriculture is the general land use throughout most of the Paris/ Galt Moraine. Urbanized portions of the
Paris/ Galt Moraine lie within the southern borders of Guelph, Cambridge and Paris.
The Paris/ Galt Moraine system crosses the upper tier municipalities of Peel, Halton, Wellington,
Hamilton, Waterloo, Brant and Norfolk and the Cities of Guelph and Cambridge, 4 subwatersheds in the
CVC, 6 subwatersheds in the GRCA and various within the Hamilton, Halton and Long Point
Conservation Authorities (Figure 3.4.1.1).
         3.4.2    Investigations of the Paris/ Galt Moraines
The moraines of southwestern Ontario were originally described in detail by Taylor (1913). Chapman and
Putnam’s various editions of the Physiography of Southern Ontario, starting in 1951, further documented
the moraine features of southern Ontario, including those of the Paris/ Galt Moraines. The majority of the
geological information and interpretation for the Paris/ Galt Moraines is presented in various Quaternary
and Pleistocene geology reports (Barnett, 1978, 1982, 1998; Cowan, 1972, 1976; Karrow, 1968, 1987;
and, White, 1975). Additional geologic information is presented in various subwatershed studies in the
form of general hydrostratigraphic cross sections (Lotowater, 1997; CG&S 1996; Stantec, 1999). The
OGS has conducted recent drilling and geological/hydrogeological interpretation of the Paris/ Galt
Moraines in the Brantford area (Bajc, 2006, 2007, 2008b).
A substantial amount of interpretation of the Paris/ Galt Moraines has been derived from the MOE water
well database. The water well data base also tends to be the major source of information for the larger-

scale watershed and subwatershed studies. The watershed based groundwater characterization studies
and integrated water budget studies present information on a regional scale, with limited local scale
hydrogeologic data, such as recharge. The subwatershed and county wide groundwater characterization
studies generally provide smaller scale characterization relating to major aquifers, water table and
potentiometric surfaces, basic groundwater availability, basic groundwater quality, recharge and
discharge areas, and contaminant susceptibility. Although these studies are carried out on a smaller scale
they are still generally too broad to present detailed small scale analysis relating specifically to the Paris/
Galt Moraines. General groundwater characteristics are presented in a limited number of groundwater
studies. Watershed and subwatershed studies and other related groundwater studies that encompass
the broader geographic area where the Paris/ Galt Moraines are present include:

4.0         Overview of Potential Water-Related Issues Associated
            with Land Use Activities
The following discussion is presented to provide a general overview of potential water-related issues
associated with various land uses and land use activities. It is not meant to be an exhaustive list or a
detailed discussion, but rather provide a “sense” of the types of potential water-related issues associated
with land use activities and possible measures to minimize or mitigate impacts.
Although various Best Management Practices (BMP) are referred to in the following discussion a number
of activities relating to potential impacts on groundwater are controlled to a great extent through existing
policies (e.g. the Provincial Policy Statement) or legislation (e.g. the Clean Water Act), including
provincially mandated Certificates of Approval and the Permit to Take Water program. Where approvals
are required, it is common to assess and quantify the potential impacts, related to a potential land use
change, and develop and implement appropriate design, mitigation and monitoring programs.
The following sections provide a brief, high-level discussion of potential water-related impacts of various
land uses, or land use activities of concern, as related to this study, in particular: urban development;
industrial development; agriculture; and, aggregate extraction. As well, a brief discussion is presented
related to the potential impact of climate change on water resources and water-related ecological
features.
4.1    URBAN DEVELOPMENT
Urban development interferes with water resources in two ways: by altering the hydrological cycle; and,
by increasing the demand for water supply. There are a number of hydrologically-related issues that
need to be considered when dealing with groundwater in urban areas. Large-scale urbanization will
impact the natural water cycle, both in terms of water quantity and water quality (e.g. Environment
Canada, 2001, Threats to Sources of Drinking Water and Aquatic Ecosystem Health in Canada; USGS
WRIR Report 97-4195, Hydrogeology and Water Quality of an Aquifer Underlying an Urban Area,
Manchester, Connecticut; UNESCO, 2005, Urban Water Management; and, Vazquez-Sune, 2003, PhD.
Thesis: Urban Groundwater, Barcelona Case Study). Concerns related to urban groundwater include:
     •    fluctuations in groundwater levels caused by changes in land and water uses through alterations
          to the hydrologic cycle;
     •    pollution from both point and non-point sources of contamination;
     •    characterization and quantification of various components of the water budget;
     •    characterizing the groundwater flow system; and,
     •    collection and integration of appropriate data for sustainable urban water management.
          4.1.1    Water Quantity
The most significant water quantity issue, typically attributed to urban development, is the potential for a
reduction in recharge due to an increase in impervious surface area. Urbanization however, will alter all
parts of the hydrologic cycle (Lerner, 1990). A cursory review of existing literature (e.g. Lerner, 1990,
2002; Howard, 1997; Vazquez-Sune, 2003) indicates that there are many factors that can either decrease
or increase the amount of recharge within an urban area, as a result of land use activities related to
urbanization. Factors that could decrease recharge include, but are not limited to:

     •   an increase in impervious surface area, increasing runoff;
     •   infrastructure intercepting shallow groundwater flow; and,
     •   increased evapotranspiration, depending on the climatic conditions and urban intensification.
Factors that could increase recharge include, but are not limited to:
     •   importation of water from lake-based systems or a distant groundwater source;
     •   leaky infrastructure;
     •   septic systems;
     •   irrigation or lawn watering;
     •   removal of agricultural tile drains;
     •   increased stormwater infiltration in pervious areas; and,
     •   decreased evapotranspiration, depending on the climatic conditions and urban intensification.
The physical impacts of land use activities due to urbanization could include the following (from
Environment Canada, 2001):
     •   increased flows, causing flooding, erosion and habitat wash out;
     •   changes in sediment regime, causing habitat destruction, interference with water quality
         processes, transport of contaminants and impacts on aquatic life;
     •   thermal energy inputs, causing thermal pollution or loss of cold water fisheries; and,
     •   impairment of vertical mixing and oxygenation of bottom water in surface water systems.
An inherent impact of increased urban development is increased demand on water services. This will
lead to increased water withdrawal from source waters used for water supply. This additional water
withdrawal could impact groundwater levels and discharge of groundwater to surface water and wetlands,
potentially impacting baseflow and maintenance of aquatic and terrestrial features.
         4.1.2     Water Quality
The water quality of both surface water and groundwater can be impacted in an urban setting. Rainfall
and snowmelt in urban areas are converted to urban runoff and the water is either transported to storm
sewers or drainage channels, ultimately discharging to streams; or infiltrates into the ground and
recharges the groundwater system. During this transport, the runoff quality is degraded by various
pollutants, sediment materials and thermal energy from the urban environment (Environment Canada,
2001; Crowe et al, 2003). The water quality of urban runoff can be impacted by a number of factors
including, but not limited to:
     •   intensity and duration of precipitation events;
     •   local air quality (a function of air pollution from local industries, wind direction etc);
     •   roofing materials in contact with roof runoff;
     •   runoff pathways/sources (i.e. parking lots, lawns, industrial sites, roadways); and,

      •    stormwater management controls.
Groundwater can also be impacted by the same factors as surface runoff, where infiltration of stormwater
occurs. There are many potential contaminant sources, including but not limited to:
      •    road salt and other de-icing chemicals used on roads, sidewalks and parking lots;
      •    petroleum product loss or leakage from motorized vehicle usage:
      •    lawn maintenance and weed control;
      •    septic systems or leaky sanitary sewer infrastructure;
      •    leaky underground storage tanks;
      •    landfills;
      •    snow dumps; and,
      •    industrial/transportation corridor spills.
Changes to water quality, as a result of urbanization, could include the following impacts:
      •    an increase in chemicals discharging with stormwater (e.g. biodegradable organics, nutrients,
           trace metals, chloride from road salt, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and hydrocarbons),
           resulting in degradation of aquatic and ecosystem health;
      •    an increase in microorganisms and “new” chemicals of concern (e.g. endocrine disrupters,
           pharmaceutical products and antibiotics) in wastewater discharging to receiving streams or rivers
           (i.e. the Grand River), potentially degrading the health of aquatic and terrestrial systems;
      •     a decrease in the assimilative capacity of the receiving streams or rivers; and,
      •    an increase in chemicals infiltrating to the groundwater system (e.g. chloride from road salt,
           hydrocarbons, chemicals from industrial spills, and nutrients and microorganisms from leaky
           sanitary sewer infrastructure) potentially impacting the quality of drinking water or water
           discharging to surface water systems.
           4.1.3     Existing Best Management Practices
The following section provides a general discussion of examples of best management practices (BMPs)
that address potential urban development impacts as they relate to the quantity and quality of
groundwater and surface water sources. Low impact development techniques are being applied in areas
around the world to address the decrease in groundwater recharge in urban areas, as well as the
degradation in urban water quality.
A large focus of BMPs for urban development relate to stormwater quantity and quality for both the
receiving surface water body (i.e. decrease high flows and minimize degrading the water quality) and
infiltration into the ground (maintain historical groundwater levels and minimize degrading the water
quality).
Various standard stormwater management techniques are used to protect groundwater levels and quality
including, but not limited to:
      •    minimize lot grading to promote infiltration;

      •    discharge of roof leaders to pervious surface or infiltration pits;
      •    direct drainage through natural and manmade swales (allows for some attenuation of metals and
           petroleum products), to ponded areas and infiltration basins;
      •    direct water (from parking lots or areas of potential spills) through oil/grit separators prior to
           discharge to infiltration pits or ponded areas;
      •    use of pervious stormwater pipes and catch basins;
      •    development of road salt management programs;
      •    regulating the use of lawn care products;
      •    education on storage and handling of typical household contaminants (i.e. gasoline, oil, paint etc).
Various manuals and guidelines dealing with stormwater management, provided by provincial and
municipal agencies, are utilized for development. The adequacy for the techniques to achieve quantity
and quality objectives is an ongoing point of discussion among regulators and consultants.
More recently Low Impact Development has been widely promoted. Low impact development is a
comprehensive land planning and engineering design approach that aims to maintain and enhance the
pre-development hydrological and hydraulic regime of an urban area, and the watershed that hosts the
development. There are several measures that municipalities and/ or landowners can carry out to reduce
runoff, enhance groundwater infiltration and help maintain pre-development groundwater recharge rates,
and surface water hydraulic regimes.
The principals of low impact development include the clustering of houses and/or buildings to protect
natural areas, which also serve as open space for recreation. Roads located in low impact developments
are narrow, and parking lots, driveways and other pervious surfaces use various types of permeable
pavements. Sidewalks and other impervious hard surfaces are limited, and the runoff from such
surfaces, as well as roof tops are directed onto vegetated areas with porous soils. In some areas, rooftop
runoff is collected and used to irrigate lawns or gardens, or in some areas to flush toilets in the homes.
All of these are examples that municipalities can employ to limit urban runoff, maintain recharge to
groundwater aquifers, and also to maintain a pre-development surface water regime.
In areas where development has already occurred, there are retrofitting measures that can be
implemented to enhance recharge and reduce runoff to surface water features. A common retrofitting
measure is disconnecting residential downspouts that drain directly into the municipal storm sewers, and
drain the water into a rain barrel to be used for lawn and garden watering, or onto the lawn or an
infiltration gallery.
Pervious pavement can also be laid down when repaving or installing new roads, sidewalks, parking lots,
or driveways. Pervious pavements allow water to infiltrate into the ground rather than traveling over the
hardened surfaces to storm sewers. Restoring the soil quality in public parks by tilling and aerating the
lands can also be effective in enhancing recharge to the groundwater system and to reduce peak flows in
the nearby creeks and rivers.
A basic education of the impacts on groundwater can be very efficient and cost effective for protecting
groundwater resources. In many areas, residents, businesses, and industries often are not aware of the
impact they have on their surroundings, and therefore, educating landowners living in significant recharge
areas on responsible land management for both water quality and quantity can be very worthwhile.
Targeted public education campaigns that explain the concepts of responsible land and water

management may lead to enhancements in infiltration such as the implementation of pervious pavements
in a business parking lot, or the disconnection of a downspout by a homeowner.
4.2     INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT
          4.2.1    Water Quantity
Industrial water users within urban areas typically do not have their own “private” water supply, and are
required to use municipal water in their operations. In rural areas, industrial facilities will typically have
their own private water supply. Some industries use only limited amounts of water, primarily for employee
use. These industries are referred to as “dry” industries. Other industries may use substantial volumes of
water in the operations. These industries are referred to as “wet” industries. The majority of water used
in industrial/manufacturing processes is for heating or cooling or used as part of a cleaning process.
There are some specific industries that use water within their manufacturing process (i.e. bottled water
companies, beverage companies and food canning industries).
          4.2.2    Water Quality
Industrial and commercial developments pose a wide variety of potential threats to water quality, through
the on-site use of various chemicals. Water quality issues related to industrial development are typically
the result of the release of point sources of contaminants, either through spills or leaks. Many of the
releases of contaminants are related to historical practices or aging infrastructure and fuel storage tanks.
There exist a large number of industrial facilities that are considered potential threats to water quality,
including the following examples:
     •    equipment manufacturing;
     •    gas stations and automotive garages;
     •    food manufacturing and processing;
     •    recycling facilities;
     •    textile product and finishing;
     •    printing services;
     •    wood product manufacturing;
     •    bulk petroleum storage; and,
     •    chemical product manufacturing.
Categories of typical risk include synthetic and volatile organic chemicals, microbiological contaminants,
inorganic chemicals, and nitrogen species (Golder, 2006).
Historical practices and historical use of chemicals were often conducted with limited understanding of the
risk associated with the use of the chemicals. Industrial chemicals were often released to the
environment through spills or leaks that were uncontained, both within and outside buildings.
Underground storage tanks were not typically monitored for loss of product through leaks. Disposable of
hazardous chemicals was often done by placing them in unlined waste lagoons or unlined landfills. As a
result, there is a legacy of chemical contamination in most industrial areas within any urban setting.

          4.2.3    Existing BMPs
Industrial water users may compete with municipalities for the same water supplies; however, there are a
number of best management practices that can be implemented by the industries to reduce their water
takings, and thereby reduce the impact on the municipal supplies. The methods used to reduce their
water takings are as variable as the types of industries (manufacturing, pulp and paper, textile, etc);
however, there are a number of measures that can be implemented by all types of manufacturing plants
and industry to reduce their water use.
The majority of water used in manufacturing plants is for heating and cooling, and process use (cleaning
of parts, vats, etc). Review of case histories in Canada, the US and overseas as part of an MOE funded
study (AquaResource, 2007) found that the most effective water conservation technique in manufacturing
facilities was the proper and optimized use of cooling towers. Cooling towers remove heat from air
conditioning systems, and industrial processes that generate excess heat. The inner workings of cooling
towers are complex and proper design and optimal use of the tower can greatly reduce water loss
(evaporative) and water used in the cooling process (North Carolina DENR, 1998).
In addition, the use of water efficient landscaping methods and technologies such as low flow sprinklers,
optimized watering schedules and xeriscaping techniques were also found to greatly decrease water use
in industrial facilities. Water use by employees was also effectively reduced through the installation of low
flow toilets, faucets and showers in washrooms, and water audits were also found to be very effective at
identifying areas where water conservation methods can be implemented. Water recycling or reuse
facilities, leak detection systems, and employee education programs were also implemented to reduce
water use and found to be highly effective.
Water use in the primary metals sector is mainly used in cooling, material conditioning, dust suppression,
cleaning (Kinkead, 2006). Water conservation measures in this sector have focused on the use of
closed-loop (closed circuit) systems, and treatment and reuse of process water. The Canadian Steel
Producers Association’s cite that more than 95% of the water used in producing steel products today is
recycled primarily in closed loop systems (CSPA, 2007).
With respect to water quality protection major industries are generally required to have spills action plans.
Areas for loading and offloading potential contaminants are expected to be contained. In addition, the
following common techniques are typically used at industrial locations to minimize the threat of a
contaminant release to surface water or groundwater:
     •    Liquid storage areas must have secondary containment to hold any spills or leaks at 10% of the
          total volume of the containers or 110% of the largest container, whichever is larger.
     •    Design of in ground protection channels for transfer hoses to minimize damage from vehicles and
          to catch leaks or spills is required.
     •    Any areas used for cleaning parts, machinery, etc. must be located within a containment area
          with an impermeable floor. There must be no direct access to outside.
     •    New and waste material storage areas must be roofed, isolated from floor drains and have sealed
          surfaces.
     •    Underground storage tanks are discouraged, however where used, they must have secondary
          containment, a monitoring system incorporating high level and leak sensing audio/visual alarms,
          level indicators and overfill protection. A protective plate will be placed in the bottom of the tank if
          a dip stick is to be used.

     •    Untreated rinse waters and floor drains must not discharge to a sanitary sewer, septic system,
          storm drain or surface water.
     •    Waste collection stations, with labelled containers for each kind of waste, must be provided
          throughout the work area for spent chemicals, soiled rags, etc.
     •    Uncovered receiving areas must be designed with a spill sump to catch and store any spilled
          chemicals with a manual operation for emptying.
     •    Wastewater from any laboratory operation must be discharged to a lab drain system that is
          separate from the sanitary wastewater drains. Laboratory drains must lead to a neutralization
          system prior to discharge to the sanitary sewer.
     •    Uncovered scrap metal storage areas must have a separate stormwater collection system with an
          oil/grit separator which discharges to a sanitary sewer or a holding tank.
     •    Hazardous materials must not be put down drains, but rather must be properly disposed of by a
          licensed hazardous waste hauler.
4.3     AGRICULTURE
          4.3.1     Water Quantity
Agricultural water use in Canada is primarily for irrigation (85%) and livestock watering (15%; Brandes
and Ferguson, 2003). Agriculture accounts for approximately 9% of total national water withdrawals
(Environment Canada); however, irrigation is a highly seasonal use, so the proportion of total water use
during the summer months is likely much higher. Approximately 67% of all the water withdrawn for
agricultural purposes is either consumed or not returned to the source from which it was taken (Kinkead,
2006).
The major agricultural water use in southwestern Ontario is primarily for irrigation of tobacco crops. Other
irrigation uses include sod, vegetables, nursery and greenhouse crops. Water use for livestock can also
create a significant local demand. Minor uses include cleaning buildings and equipment and domestic
use.
Both surface water and groundwater are used in agricultural operations. The primary source used will
depend on the local seasonal availability and water quality. In areas where water use is high such, as
Norfolk County (i.e. on the Norfolk Sand Plain), the deeper groundwater sources have poor water quality.
From a water balance perspective the type of crop being grown, put into production, or taken out of
production can significantly affect evapotranspiration (ET) and thus the potential for recharge. Tillage
practices can also affect the potential runoff and again the potential for recharge. The re-conditioning of
soil can affect the infiltration capacity.
Tiles drains may also affect the water available for recharge, by short circuiting it to water courses,
although the delayed drainage may add to short term low flow impacts in some streams.
Sediment loading to streams, due to soil erosion, may impact groundwater discharge areas if the fine-
grained sediment that has been eroded is deposited over the coarser-grained sediment within the stream.
A comprehensive study on agricultural water supply issues in Ontario, conducted in 2003 (Marshall,
Macklin, Monaghan, 2003), noted that five studies were being carried out under the direction of the MOE

and MNR related to water budgets, water allocation and instream flows. These studies, along with other
initiatives in the Long Point Conservation Area, were not available for this review.
          4.3.2     Water Quality
In the past 40 years agriculture in Canada has been substantially altered due to: greater mechanization;
the use of mineral fertilizers and pesticides; new and better varieties of crops; and, innovative farming
practices (Chambers et al, 2002, Effects of Agricultural Activities on Water Quality, CCME Workshop).
Water quality can be potentially impacted by both point source and non-point source contaminants
(Chambers et al, 2002; and, Harker, 1998, Non-Point Agricultural Effects on Water Quality). Non-point
source contamination could include:
      •   fertilizer nutrients;
      •   sewage biosolids;
      •   pesticides;
      •   pathogens; and,
      •   endoctrine disrupting substances and pharmaceuticals.
General point source contaminants include:
      •   fuel storage;
      •   chemical storage;
      •   spills;
      •   septic systems for domestic sewage and farm wastewater; and,
      •   manure storage.
Table 4.3.1 shows a generalized chart of the potential agricultural effects on water quality as presented in
Coote and Gregorich, 2000, an Agriculture Canada publication entitled “The Health of Our Water –
Towards Sustainable Agriculture in Canada.
Coote and Gregorich, 2000 describe the difficulty in measuring, on a reasonable scale, the level of
groundwater contamination from agriculture and the source area of the contamination, due to:
      •   the high cost of monitoring;
      •   the seasonal and spatial variability of contaminant movement and water flow;
      •   the large number and diversity of farms and farming practices; and,
      •   the scalar differences in topography, soil and climate.

Extensive research has looked at methods to reduce overall water demand for irrigation purposes, and
several measures were shown to be effective at reducing water demand for crop irrigation. Many of these
studies were undertaken in cooperation with farmers and irrigators to determine the most effective
measures for reducing water demand.
According to the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA), operational measures
that have been particularly effective at reducing total demand include the use of irrigation management
plans that outline crop water requirements, critical seasons, and irrigation infrastructure. Other measures
include the use of high efficiency irrigation equipment such as trickle/drip or low pressure/low trajectory
irrigating methods, and monitoring and maintenance of irrigation equipment to reduce leakage and water
loss. Monitoring of soil moisture to indicate when irrigation is required is also effective at reducing water

demand, as is the use of rain gauges within irrigated fields, to determine depth and uniformity of irrigation
across an irrigated area.
Planting windbreaks or wind strips, which reduce or decrease the impact of winds, help to reduce water
loss from crops. The use of plastic or organic mulches to retain water, and the use of conservation tillage
to maintain more organic residue on the surface are also effective at reducing water demand. Avoiding
compaction of soil across an area aids in the infiltration of water, and decreases loss of water to tile
drains or nearby surface water features.
Land management practices which aid in minimizing impacts on infiltration and groundwater quality
include:
     •   crop rotation;
     •   conservation tillage systems; and,
     •   cover crops.
Appropriate nutrient management dealing with the amount and timing of application significantly
minimizes the potential for groundwater degradation. Integrated pest management (i.e. planting crops to
lure pests away from main crops etc) reduces pesticide application.
4.4     AGGREGATE EXTRACTION
         4.4.1    Water Quantity
The physical presence of an excavation can have a variety of potential impacts on the groundwater
system. Some effects or changes will be minor, such as the impact of above water table extraction on the
groundwater flow direction. Below the water table, with no mitigation measures, increases the potential to
alter the local groundwater flow system.
Potential changes to the direction and flux of groundwater flow as a result of aggregate extraction are
caused by two general mechanisms:
     •   a change in the water budget, more specifically the groundwater budget; and;
     •   a change to the characteristics of the porous media (i.e. the removal of aggregate material).
Changes in the water budget
Above the water table extraction factors include:
     •   changes in runoff and evapotranspiration; and,
     •   changes in unsaturated fractured rock and conduit flow within the rock.
Below the water table extraction factors include:
     •   Changes in runoff and evapotranspiration.
     •   Pumping of groundwater from ponds or well water for aggregate extraction (i.e. washing,
         processing) can create drawdown cones in the hydrostratigraphic unit being pumped. The extent
         of drawdown will depend on: the size of the pond or the location and depth of the well; the
         pumping rate; the hydrostratigraphy (particularly whether the flow is occurring in an unconfined,

MORAINES
        semi-confined or confined geologic unit); local recharge conditions; and, the potential for
        interception of a surface water body by the drawdown cone.
    •   The physical extraction of aggregate material below the water table (i.e. dragline operation in
        sand and gravel pits) will also induce flow towards the excavation, at least on a temporary basis.
        The removal of solid material is replaced by inflowing water. The rate of extraction dictates an
        equivalent flow of water needed to replace the additional void space.
Changes in the characteristics of the geologic material
Above the water table extraction factors include:
    •   Loss of geologic material and soils above the water table and modification of runoff patterns.
    •   Induced fracturing from blasting in quarries or stress release from the quarry excavation and
        removal of load bearing material.
Below the water table extraction factors include:
    •   Removal of porous media and subsequent infilling with water creates a zone of “infinite”
        permeability. This zone would act as a local hydraulic lens pulling water in from upgradient and
        releasing it downgradient through the pond (i.e. the path of least resistance). There may be an
        increase or decrease in local groundwater recharge depending on climatic conditions for
        evaporation versus evapotranspiration. The total groundwater flow through the extraction area
        and the groundwater flow paths are altered on a local scale. The impacts of these changes on a
        more intermediate/regional scale will depend on the size and location (i.e. is it in a recharge area
        or discharge area) of the extractive activity relative to the overall groundwater flow system.
    •   Removal of porous media and subsequent infilling with material of lower permeability. There will
        be a decrease in recharge on a local scale. The total groundwater flow through the excavation
        and the groundwater flow paths near the excavation are altered on a local scale. Infilling with low
        permeability material is typically not done in Ontario, but is done in many areas of Europe where
        land available for development is limited.
A detailed literature review investigating potential impacts on groundwater and surface water related to
source water protection was carried out for MNR in 2006 (Blackport and Golder, 2006). This review
involved researching sources of information from international agencies, academic institutions, peer-
reviewed journals and the internet. Results showed very little documentation of groundwater impacts
due to aggregate extraction, other than as a result of umitigated quarry dewatering. The following findings
were presented, related to groundwater quantity:
    •   Aggregate extraction causes limited change to the overall water balance of an aquifer system,
        unless large scale unmitigated dewatering occurs, and will have limited potential impact on
        source water protection from a groundwater quantity perspective.
    •   Changes in the groundwater flow system, as a result of aggregate extraction below the water
        table, may locally modify capture areas of a municipal well or well field in the same aquifer,
        depending on proximity of the aggregate operation to the municipal well or well field.
    •   The existence of post-extraction lakes increases the overall groundwater storage within the
        aquifer where extraction has occurred.
    •   Various studies demonstrated that appropriate mitigation, including infiltration trenches and
        barrier walls, could reduce the impact of aggregate extraction on local groundwater levels.

         4.4.2    Water Quality
Groundwater quality concerns related to the aggregate extraction and land use activities associated with
aggregate extraction can be divided into three components, based on activities that could generate a
potential contaminant of concern (Blackport and Golder, 2006):
    •    operational activities such as on-site storage of fuel;
    •    ancillary uses on-site, such as asphalt plants; and,
    •    future land use, site rehabilitation or uncontrolled/illegal dumping.
The on-site sources of contaminants include but are not limited to petroleum products and dust
suppressants from normal operational activities and possible release of contaminants related to ancillary
uses (e.g. asphalt plant).
Backfilling of non-inert material both above and below the water table can leach contaminants and enter
the groundwater flow system directly where no fine grained layer exists within the excavation. It is
important to note that activities such the importation of fill and storage of fuel are highly regulated within
the Province of Ontario and must meet strict standards.
An unmitigated loss of the surficial soil layer and loss of any amount of the unsaturated zone reduces the
attenuative capabilities of the porous media to biodegrade, and chemically or physically interact with any
potential contaminants that would be introduced through overland flow or acidic precipitation.
The exposure of a gravel pit pond to the atmosphere, precipitation and surface water run off can lead to a
modification of aqueous chemistry through changes in nutrient inputs, oxygen demand, biological
processes, water temperature etc. The resulting groundwater/surface water interchange can modify the
groundwater quality downgradient of the gravel pit pond.
The shallower groundwater systems in Ontario typically have average groundwater temperatures within
2-3 degrees Celsius of the long-term average air temperature (10oC). Temperatures at the water table
can vary by more than 10oC depending on the thickness of the unsaturated zone. Ponds will warm and
cool groundwater seasonally, depending on their size and depth and rate of interchange with the shallow
groundwater system. Removal of the unsaturated zone may alter the shallow groundwater temperature
immediately underlying the excavation thus creating the potential for a thermal plume to migrate from the
extraction site.
The MNR study (Blackport and Golder, 2006) also presented findings related to groundwater quality.
These included:
    •    A decrease in the contaminant attenuative ability when the soil layer and unsaturated zone is
         removed. This results in an increased potential for contaminants to enter and travel through the
         groundwater system from any surface source of contamination (e.g. surface runoff from future
         land use activities). Where the aggregate extends to ground surface the loss is minimal unless
         there is a water supply immediately adjacent to the extraction area.
    •    Water quality changes downgradient of a post-extraction lake, as a result of exposure of the
         water table to the atmosphere. These changes include changes in pH and dissolved oxygen that
         could impact nutrient and metal concentrations, locally down gradient of the post-extraction lake.
         The degree of impact is a function of the existing water quality and existing impact from surface
         sources of contamination.

     •    Thermal plumes from the below water extraction and post-extraction ponds were typically very
          localized. Depending on the hydrogeologic setting, the impact was typically less than 200 m.
     •    Post-extractive use of an aggregate site, in particular infilling with non-inert material, presents a
          significant potential source for groundwater contamination.
     •    Abandoned or uncontrolled access aggregate sites have the greatest potential for generating
          contaminants that could be introduced to the groundwater system through historical practices of
          illegal dumping. Not withstanding this concern, there is limited information in the literature
          indicating contamination of water supplies from poor landfilling practices or illegal dumping in
          closed or abandoned pits and quarries.
     •    The risk or impacts from the loss of attenuation is directly connected to the management of the
          potential operational contaminants (i.e. petroleum products) and the management of adjacent
          stormwater runoff or post extractive application of agricultural products
It was noted that no documented cases were presented with respect to significant groundwater quality
impacts of municipal well fields or water supply as a result of aggregate extraction in gravel pits.
          4.4.3    Existing BMPs
Aggregate extraction and water taking gravel pit operations may induce changes to the groundwater flow
system as described in Section 4.4.1. Some examples of mitigation strategies and best management
practices are presented below.
Extraction Geometry and Extraction Rate
The distance between the extraction site and the potentially sensitive surface water body would generally
be a factor in minimizing the impacts. This must be considered in the context of understanding the actual
site specific groundwater flow system. Large extraction sites could have varied groundwater flow paths
due to complex hydrostratigraphy.
In cases where extraction will be occurring below the water table, across a large area, then extraction
could first occur at the furthest point away from any potentially sensitive area to minimize impact. This
has a number of advantages:
     •    Ongoing monitoring can determine if measured water level changes are greater than the
          predicted changes. If there are greater than anticipated impacts to water levels, appropriate
          mitigation measures can be undertaken. The greater distance between the extraction area and
          the sensitive area will provide a buffer to minimize unacceptable impacts and allow for adaptive
          management during active extraction
     •    The initial extraction phase will provide a pond, to act as a storage reservoir, which will increase
          in size as extraction proceeds closer to a sensitive area. The increased buffering capacity of the
          reservoir of water will minimize water level impacts during later stages of extraction.
Ideally, to minimize impacts on the groundwater flow system, extraction should proceed such that a series
post-extraction ponds would have water levels would generally emulate the pre-existing water table
conditions. The simplest approach would be to proceed with a series of extraction phases that would not
be connected and would conform to a geometry similar to the pre-existing water table contours. This in
essence would be a form of “water table landscaping”. This approach has been modelled and has
demonstrated that it can minimize changes to the water table and groundwater flow system.

 REVIEW OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE FOR THE WATERLOO AND PARIS/ GALT
MORAINES
Based on the groundwater flow dynamics, relating the size of the pit and the contact perimeter with the
water table and the flux, it may be beneficial to initially have a larger shallow excavation below the water
table, as opposed to a smaller deeper excavation. Site-specific water budget factors and operational
considerations may dictate whether this is appropriate or not.
The seasonal and long-term rates of extraction could be considered in minimizing changes to the water
table. Initially, smaller rates of extraction may provide minimal impacts until the pond size provides an
appropriate buffer (i.e. overall reservoir and perimeter size) for higher extraction rates. Although
operationally problematic, it may be better to increase production during the cooler, wetter periods to
buffer against the natural seasonal reductions in water levels.
Water Management
On-site water can be moved around from pond to pond to stabilize hydraulic gradients in a particular
direction. Water could be added to the ponds from sources outside the pre-existing groundwater flow
system, including high flow stream run-off and groundwater from a lower confined aquifer. In both cases
the removal of water from these systems must not interfere with the functional attributes they supply to
their downstream/aquifer receptors.
Barriers and Infiltration Trenches
Barriers and infiltration trenches provide the same function, to support or maintain the pre-existing
hydraulic gradient outside of the working area and can be successfully carried out depending on the site
specific hydrogeologic setting and the extent of effort to construct.
Artificial barriers can be used in the pond settings to minimize seepage into the pond where the pond
level is lower than the adjacent pre-existing water level. These barriers can be constructed in a number of
ways either along portions of the pond bed or in excavations adjacent to the pond. A fine-grained layer on
the bottom of the pond provides a lower hydraulic conductivity unit which reduces the effect of directing
groundwater to the pond. This can reduce the groundwater flow system modification and reduce the
thermal plume migration.
Recharge trenches can be constructed between the pond and the receptor, usually adjacent to the pond.
Water is diverted into the trench to maintain the pre-existing water level. Recharge trenches are usually
done in concert with barriers to minimize flow of recharge water back to the pond. The effectiveness of
recharge trenches will be dependent on the site-specific hydrostratigraphy and the depth to the water
table.
          4.4.4    Cumulative Effects Assessment
There is the potential for “cumulative effects” on groundwater resources, due potential overlapping
impacts of land use activities in close proximity to each other. In the case of aggregate extraction there
may be cumulative impacts associated with modification to the local groundwater flow system, due to
local changes in the water table elevations, and/or temporary modification to groundwater flow during
active extraction. The overall impact of these combined changes will depend on:
     •    the resilience of the physical system;
     •    the natural trends or variations within the physical flow system;
     •    the proximity of the combined extraction activities and the location of these activities within the
          groundwater flow system (e.g. recharge area or discharge area); and,

      •   the design measures used to mitigate the potential impacts of each extraction operation or
          activity.
The literature review carried out for MNR (Blackport and Golder; 2006) also searched for studies or
reports addressing cumulative impacts, associated with aggregate extraction operations in close proximity
to each other, and concluded the following:
      •   There are few studies in the literature that address cumulative impact of aggregate extraction.
          Case history studies that do assess cumulative impacts do not appear to show impacts to the
          groundwater system at a subwatershed scale, although local impacts were observed on a site-
          specific basis.
It is noted that a guidance document for aggregate extraction is currently being prepared by various
provincial stakeholders and is entitled “Cumulative Effects Assessment and Best Management Practices
Paper for Below Water Aggregate Operations”. It is presently in Draft form and not available.
4.5     POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
The following section presents a high level overview of the potential impacts of climate change on water
resources and ecological features that rely on water. As indicated in previous sections, this overview is
no meant to be an exhaustive review as considerable literature exists on the potential impacts of climate
change. Research is ongoing and constantly being updated. Much of the information presented in this
section focuses on the potential impacts of climate change, related to the climatic conditions associated
with the Great Lakes basin in general. The general information presented in this section is primarily from
two main publications: Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation: A Canadian Perspective, by Natural
Resources Canada, 2004; and, Threats to Water Availability in Canada, by Environment Canada,
National Water Research Institute, 2004.
There are many potential impacts related to climate change, depending on the existing climatic conditions
within a specific geographic location and the sector of the economy or environment that would be
impacted. A general flow chart showing examples of the potential impact of climate change is presented
in Figure 6.4.1 from Natural Resources Canada (2004) for lower lake levels in the Great Lakes-St.
Lawrence basin. A variety of sectors, such as transportation, fisheries, municipalities and agriculture are
impacted. Potential impacts include: decreased navigation on waterways due to lower water levels; loss
of species habitat; poorer water quality; and, water contamination. The following presents a general
summary of potential impacts and issues related to water resources and climate change that could be
occur in southern Ontario:
Surface Water - Water Quantity and Water Supply
      •   Summer flows are expected to decline, which will impact the assimilative capacity of the receiving
          streams or rivers (e.g. the Grand River).
      •   The magnitude of spring flooding will likely decline, however increased winter flows will increase
          the risk of severe flooding in the winter.
      •   There will be increased property damage due to increased flooding during both winter/spring melt
          events and severe summer storms.

MORAINES
      •     Under normal conditions, there will be an increase in groundwater recharge in areas where the
            shallow soils are permeable or there are closed depressions, due to a shift in timing of the spring
            thaw and increased recharge during winter conditions.
      •     Shallow aquifers may be temporarily (i.e. several years) impacted by an increasing number of
            prolonged droughts resulting in a reduction in water levels, storage in the aquifer, recharge to
            deeper aquifers and discharge to surface water.
      •     There may be greater stress on the deeper aquifer system as more water may be required from
            the deeper, more buffered aquifers, if there is less water available in shallow aquifers during
            prolonged droughts.
Water Quality
      •     Lower river levels will typically result in higher pollutant concentrations and increased
            concentrations of toxins and bacteria in the water.
      •     There will be an increased likelihood of water-borne health impacts.
      •     Higher flows and flooding events will increase the turbidity and the flushing of contaminants into
            the surface water system and increase erosion of soils and sediment loading to the surface water
            system.
      •     Increased surface water temperatures, decreased duration of ice cover and lower water levels
            may contribute to decreased concentrations of dissolved oxygen and increased concentrations of
            nutrients, such as phosphorous, in surface water.
Ecological
      •     Lower water levels will result in a decrease the assimilative and purification abilities of wetlands.
      •     Drier conditions may shift the hydroperiod, potentially changing the wetland ecosystem to “drier”
            vegetative species. Shorter winters and longer summers will impact water availability to
            terrestrial ecosystems.
      •     During increased periods of extended drought there will be less baseflow to maintain creeks and
            wetlands, impacting aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.
      •     Greater evapotranspiration in the summer will decrease the water availability to terrestrial and
            wetland systems.
Water Demand
      •     Warmer temperatures and drier conditions will increase the urban water demand causing greater
            stress on the pumped aquifer system.
      •     Agricultural water demand will greatly increase, which is likely to impact the shallow groundwater
            system where most water taking will occur.
Water managers are increasingly considering the impact of climate change and how to adapt to climate
change (Natural Resources Canada, 2004). Because of the uncertainty associated with climate change,
it is difficult to deal with risk assessment. It is one additional factor that water managers add to other
uncertainties, such as population growth and changing economic conditions. Typically, most existing
water management plans, including water supply and water drainage systems are based on historical
climatic and hydrological records (Natural Resources Canada, 2004). These records may not be
applicable in the future, especially related to managing stormwater due to increased intensity of

precipitation events. Water managers are looking at a number of adaptation options for water resources
including the following (Natural Resources Canada, 2004):
     •   water conservation measures;
     •   improved planning and preparedness for floods and droughts;
     •   improved water quality protection from all land use activities;
     •   enhanced monitoring programs, quality and quantity; and,
     •   infrastructure adaptations, such as sizing of stormwater management ponds and storm sewer
         systems and modification of larger flood control structures.
Assessment of the potential impact of climate change on water resources has also been conducted on a
more site-specific basis. A case study, assessing the hydrologic impacts of climate change at the
watershed scale, was conducted as part of an M.Sc. thesis at the University of Waterloo. Brouwers
(2007) performed complex numerical model simulations using the Alder Creek watershed area, in the
Waterloo Moraine, to evaluate climate change scenarios. The Alder Creek watershed was chosen as it
had been previously well characterized and was relatively small in size. A coupled surface-subsurface
water model was used to determine a suitable approach for conducting long-term transient simulations at
a watershed scale (Brouwers, 2007).
Two contrasting scenarios of climate change were evaluated. Drier and wetter future conditions were
evaluated relative to a reference scenario. The reference scenario was based on existing climate
records. The results of the study indicated the following:
     •   Climate change simulations results showed a strong impact on the timing of hydrologic
         processes, shifting the spring snow melt to earlier in the year. This resulted in an overall decrease
         in runoff for both drier and wetter conditions. There was also an increase in infiltration under both
         drier and wetter conditions.
     •   A marked increase in total evapotranspiration was found in both climate scenarios. This was
         most pronounced in the summer months.
     •   The simulations results showed a small overall rise in groundwater levels for both climate change
         scenarios.

5.0       Current Understanding of the Waterloo Moraine
5.1     OVERVIEW
Section 3.3 provided a detailed summary of the history of investigations associated with the Waterloo
Moraine, in order to put into perspective the current understanding of the level of knowledge of the
understanding of the Waterloo Moraine.
The following sections provide a summary of the current understanding and state of knowledge of the
Waterloo Moraine. It is divided in general headings as outlined in the objectives (Section 1.2). It is noted
that the discussion of the Waterloo Moraine differs considerably from the discussion of the Paris/ Galt
Moraines, given: the inherently different geographical and geological settings; the major functions of each
of the moraines; and, the level of investigation of each moraine due to the differences in the level of water
supply exploration and urban development on each of the moraines.
5.2     WATERLOO MORAINE BOUNDARY
The boundary of the Waterloo Moraine has been interpreted in several different ways. In interpreting a
feature such as the Waterloo Moraine, it is difficult to establish a “distinct” boundary. As discussed in
Section 3.3, the Waterloo Moraine was mapped as early as 1913 by Taylor, and described as “a finely
formed moraine ridge running south from Waterloo to Ayr and west to Bamberg” (Bajc and Karrow, 2004).
Chapman and Putnam (1951) refined the geographic extent and character of the Waterloo Moraine in
1951, and subsequently in 1972 and 1984. Karrow noted many years ago that there was a core of fine
sand and that parts of the moraine were capped by fine-grained tills. Two major ridges were noted (Bajc
and Karrow, 2004), representing important ice-marginal positions. Karrow also recognized a number of
spurs extending out from the Waterloo Moraine.
The mapping of the surficial geology also shows areas of hummocky topography throughout the general
area of the Waterloo Moraine. The hummocky topography extends across a number of surficial geologic
units, including the outwash sands associated with the core of the Waterloo Moraine and a number of the
fine-grained till units surrounding the core area of the Waterloo Moraine. All of these factor into the
variations in the interpretation of the boundary of the Waterloo Moraine.
Figure 5.2.1 shows the interpretation of the boundary of the Waterloo Moraine, as provided by MOE for
this study. The interpretation is based on glacial depositional environments, topographic descriptions and
geologic material types described by the OGS in the Surficial Geology of Ontario (OGS, 2003). The OGS
compilation of moraine boundaries does not outline the moraines explicitly. The OGS created a layer of
“hummocky topography” from the existing surficial geology maps. The hummocky topography provides
an approximate outline of the moraines. Not all existing surficial geology mapping shows a hummocky
topography layer. The mapping of the hummocky topography also does not necessarily indicate an
association with a specific moraine. In the case of the Waterloo Moraine the boundary areas that would
be of importance are the western areas of the moraine, west of the Kitchener and Waterloo city boundary
(Figure 5.2.1). These areas appear to correlate with hummocky topography mapped by Karrow (1993),
in the Quaternary Geology of the Stratford-Conestogo Area.
Figure 5.2.2 shows the interpretation of the Waterloo Moraine from Chapman and Putnam, 1984. Their
mapping is based on interpreting the approximate boundary of the kame moraine landform, and was not
specifically called the Waterloo Moraine in the physiographic interpretation. The general outline of the
kame moraine is not as extensive as the general OGS interpretation, especially along the western
boundary (e.g. north of Baden). It appears that the mapping generally corresponds to the extent of the

ice-contact sand and gravel in the core area of the Waterloo Moraine and does not include the till units
that overlie the ice contact sand and gravel unit.
Figure 5.2.3 shows a recent presentation of the Waterloo Moraine boundary by Karrow (Bajc and Karrow,
2004; Bajc and Shirota, 2007). Much of the mapping is similar to the OGS, (2003) version; however it is
not as extensive in some of the western areas compared to earlier the OGS version. In particular, the
following differences are noted:
     •   Two areas jutting out to the east and southeast of Haysville, on the OGS (2003) version (Figure
         5.2.1), which were mapped as hummocky terrain, are not shown on Karrow’s mapping (Figure
         5.2.3). These areas are shown as fine-grained till units on the surficial geology mapping.
         Karrow’s boundary corresponds more closely to the boundary of the ice-contact sands in the core
         area of the Waterloo Moraine.
     •   There is a more extensive southward extension of the Waterloo Moraine, on the OGS (2003)
         version, just east of Wellesley (Figure 5.2.1), compared to Karrow’s mapping (Figure 5.2.3). As
         previously indicated the OGS version shows this area as hummocky topography from the surficial
         geology mapping. This area is also mapped as a fine-grained till (Mornington Till) and is mapped
         by Karrow as being part of the Macton Moraine, to the west. Karrow’s boundary line again
         generally corresponds to the surficial boundary ice-contact sand (Karrow, 1993) in the core of the
         Waterloo Moraine.
     •   An extension of the Waterloo Moraine in the northwest, towards Crosshill, is evident in the OGS
         (2003) version, as it is mapped as hummocky topography. Karrow interprets this area as part of
         the Macton Moraine and is also mapped as the Mornington Till, with the exception of the Crosshill
         Spur, a local ice-contact sand unit. Karrow’s boundary is again correlated to the ice-contact sand
         unit.
The OGS has been conducting three-dimensional mapping studies of the Quaternary deposits throughout
the Region of Waterloo, since 2003. A report was produced in 2007, (Bajc and Shirota, 2007) presenting
the findings of the detailed mapping and interpretation. The current interpretation by the OGS suggests
that the Waterloo Moraine may extend farther southeast than has been previously interpreted. Figure
5.2.4 presents mapping by the OGS (Bajc and Shirota, 2007) that shows areas of the “Waterloo Moraine
and equivalent aquifers” with a total thickness greater than 10 m and an aquitard cover of less than 1 m.
The mapping itself does not specifically indicate that the entire area shown in green on Figure 5.2.4 is
interpreted as the being part of the Waterloo Moraine. However, the OGS has indicated that the southern
portion of this area may be an extension of the Waterloo Moraine with sediments having been modified by
outwash processes within this area. This area generally correlates with ice-contact sands and gravels,
outwash sands as mapped by Karrow (1987). The implications of this are discussed in Section 7.
As part of the Region of Waterloo’s water resources protection strategy they have identified the
importance of the Waterloo Moraine and have included the feature in their Draft Regional Official Plan
(ROP), (Region of Waterloo 2008a). They have also designated major recharge areas of the Waterloo
Moraine within their ROP (discussed in Section 5.5.1). Figure 5.2.5 shows the boundary of the Waterloo
Moraine, as designated by the Region of Waterloo. The boundary of the Waterloo Moraine generally
corresponds to 2003 mapping by the OGS, with the exception of several of Karrow’s exclusions in the
northwest, as noted in the second and third bullet above. These are the areas that Karrow mapped as
part of the Macton Moraine. In other words, the Region’s Waterloo Moraine boundary is essentially the
hummocky topography as outlined by the OGS, without the areas of the Macton Moraine as mapped by
Karrow. It is also noted that both of the areas excluded are areas of fine-grained tills. The implications of
these variations are discussed in Section 7.3.1.

5.3   GEOLOGY AND HYDROSTRATIGRAPHY
The understanding and interpretation of the geology and hydrostratigraphy of the Waterloo Moraine has
evolved over the last 40- 50 years, as previously discussed in detail in Section 3.3. In summary, the
present understanding of the Waterloo Moraine evolved in the following manner:
    •   Original investigations only focused on water supply in the Waterloo Moraine as the water
        resources potential was recognized early in the growth of Kitchener and Waterloo. Little
        emphasis was placed on understanding the geology of the area as the focus was on finding areas
        of sand and gravel that produced water. Initially, the exploration was within the urban boundaries
        of Kitchener and Waterloo, but expanded westward as the cities expanded.
    •   Work by Dixon (1973), developed the general concept of a three aquifer system, within the
        geographic area of the Waterloo Moraine. These units were interpreted to be hydraulically
        connected, at least in some areas. It was found that much of the water supply in the urban
        centres were existed at depth below one or more till units, while the water supplies to the west
        were often found in thick sands and gravels, with little or no till present above these sand and
        gravels.
    •   As the Region expanded in the mid-1970’s so did the Earth Science Department at the University
        of Waterloo, with several top researchers in hydrogeology (Dr. Farvolden, Dr. Frind and Dr.
        Cherry) joining the department. The Earth Science department already had a Quaternary
        geologist (Dr. Karrow). Investigations on specific well fields were conducted to better understand
        the hydraulic connections between aquifers and begin to better understand and manage the
        groundwater resource. This understanding expanded in the late 1970’s and 1980’s as the
        geographic area of investigations expanded, trying to piece together the geology and
        hydrogeology of a multi-aquifer system, primarily in the core area of the Waterloo Moraine.
    •   In 1989, groundwater contamination of a municipal well in Elmira triggered the Region of
        Waterloo to develop a water resources protection strategy. An understanding of the
        hydrogeology of the Waterloo Moraine area was the first major initiative, given that it supplied
        most of the water to Kitchener and Waterloo. Major drilling programs, including collection of
        continuous geologic samples of deeper Quaternary sediments greatly increased the
        understanding of the geology and hydrostratigraphy of the Waterloo Moraine area. Well field
        shutdowns and pumping tests were conducted to assess the capture areas of well fields and the
        hydraulic connection between aquifer units. Additional water quality data was obtained away from
        the well fields, to aid in understanding the groundwater flow system and groundwater recharge
        throughout the Waterloo Moraine. Groundwater flow modelling was conducted using this
        information to further delineate capture zones for each of the well fields.
    •   Following the Walkerton water contamination incident of 2001, a recommendation of the
        Walkerton Inquiry was to develop a watershed-based approach to source protection. As part of
        new initiatives for source protection a more science-based approach to understanding the
        geology was developed through partnerships with the OGS and the GSC. This resulted in a major
        pilot project involving the development of a 3-dimensional model of Quaternary deposits in the
        Region of Waterloo.
    •   This OGS project has been ongoing for about five years and has supplemented the previous work

A conceptual geological model has been refined for the Waterloo Moraine area, by the OGS, as shown in
Figure 5.3.1. Within the Waterloo Moraine there are six sequences (excluding bedrock) in the conceptual
hydrostratigraphic model, as shown in Table 5.3.1. Note that the first sequence in the OGS model,
Sequence I, is not present in the area of the Waterloo Moraine.

         the equivalent of Aquitard 1in the Region’s conceptual hydrogeological model. The lower Maryhill
         Till correlates to the Region’s Aquitard 2.
     •   Sequence III, is comprised of the Catfish Creek Drift, with an upper and lower Catfish Creek Till
         and a middle aquifer unit within the Catfish Creek Drift. The aquifer unit is not considered a major
         aquifer unit in the OGS hydrostratigraphic model. This unit could be considered part of the
         Region’s Aquifer 2 where the unit is present. It has been interpreted (Terraqua, 1995) that in
         some areas, parts of the Catfish Creek Drift can be considered an aquifer or an aquitard,
         depending on the thickness and whether some of the till has been reworked or is fractured. The
         transmissive nature of portions of the Catfish Creek Drift has been noticed in pumping test data
         (Terraqua, 1995) however it is generally considered to be Aquitard 3 in the Region’s model.
     •   Sequence IV is comprised of Pre-Catfish Creek Till aquifers and is the equivalent of Aquifer 3 in
         the Region’s hydrogeologic model. This unit is more extensive under the eastern portion of the
         Waterloo Moraine.
     •   Sequence V is comprised of the Canning Drift, a silty clay till and associated fine-texture lake
         deposits. This unit is typically not very thick, where present, but may be laterally extensive on a
         local scale. It is interpreted as Aquitard 4 in the Region’s hydrostratigraphic interpretation.
     •   Sequence VI is comprised of pre-Canning Till aquifers. The geologic units in this sequence are
         not very prevalent throughout the most of the Waterloo Moraine area, and are often described as
         “dirty” or cemented. Where this sequence does exist, it appears that it is considered part of
         Aquifer 3 in the Region’s interpretation.
     •   Sequence VII is comprised of Pre-Canning aquitards. This sequence is only found in a few
         locations throughout the area of the Waterloo Moraine, and where present is typically a sandy silt
         till with some clay. It is interpreted to also be part of Aquitard 4 in the Regional hydrostratigraphic
         model.
5.4    SIGNIFICANT AQUIFERS
As discussed in the previous section there are considered to be three significant water supply aquifers
within in the area of the Waterloo Moraine, not including any potential aquifers in the underlying bedrock.
For simplicity sake, the three aquifers are typically described as being part of the Waterloo Moraine,
although technically the lower aquifers are found below the sediments of the Waterloo Moraine. These
aquifers supply much of the water to the cities of Kitchener and Waterloo as well as several smaller
municipalities in the surrounding Townships. The water supply is discussed in Section 5.5.2.
The aquifers are generally laterally extensive and may or may not be hydraulically connected to each
other, throughout the area. Typically, Aquifer 1 (Regional interpretation) is an extensive sand and gravel
in the core of the Waterloo Moraine capable of producing substantial quantities of water. This aquifer is
found within the Waterloo Moraine sediments. The main recharge area of the Waterloo Moraine supplies
water to this aquifer as the aquifer is typically exposed at ground surface throughout the core area of the
Waterloo Moraine. This aquifer also supplies water to headwater streams originating in the core area of
the Waterloo Moraine as well as supplying water to many of the coldwater fisheries and wetlands within
the Waterloo Moraine (see Section 5.5.3).
Figure 3.3.15, previously discussed, shows a hydrostratigraphic cross-section through the Waterloo
Moraine to illustrate the aquifer system. In the west portion of the cross-section, Aquifer 1 (Region
interpretation) is very thick and laterally extensive throughout the core area of the Waterloo Moraine.
Water supply wells in the core western portion of the Waterloo Moraine are located in Aquifer 1.
Coldwater creeks such as Alder Creek and Hunsberger Creek originate in the core area of the Waterloo

MORAINES
Moraine (see Section 5.5.3). Aquifer 1 thins out moving eastward and is general of very limited water
supply capability within the urban areas.
The lower aquifers, below the lower Maryhill Till, are typically only limited thickness and areal extent
under the core of the Waterloo Moraine and, if present, are not very productive. This is due to the typically
thick sequence of Maryhill Till limiting groundwater recharge to depth in the core area of the Waterloo
Moraine. Aquifers 2 and 3 are thicker and more laterally extensive in the eastern portion of the Waterloo
Moraine, under the urban areas of Kitchener and Waterloo (e.g. the eastern portion of the cross-section in
Figure 3.3.15). In some areas the Maryhill Till is thin or non-existent creating a hydraulic connection
between Aquifer 1 and the lower aquifers. Most of the municipal water supply wells in the urban areas
are located in Aquifer 2 and Aquifer 3. Depending on the thickness of the Catfish Creek Till or the
depositional environment (e.g. some reworking of the Catfish Creek Till) Aquifer 2 and Aquifer 3 can act
as one aquifer, with the Catfish Creek Till sediments.
5.5    SIGNIFICANCE AND FUNCTIONS OF THE WATERLOO MORAINE
          5.5.1   Recharge
The Waterloo Moraine plays a major role in the recharge of the local and regional groundwater system
(Terraqua, 1995; Bajc and Shirota, 2007; GRCA, 2008). The rate of recharge however is highly variable
ranging from <120 mm to >500 mm/yr (GRCA, 2008). Although the Waterloo Moraine landform is often
described as a major recharge area not all areas of the Waterloo Moraine will provide major recharge. As
previously discussed in the geology section, the core area of the Waterloo Moraine is sand while a major
portion of the flanks the moraine has a low hydraulic conductivity till present at ground surface. Figure
5.5.1 shows the Regional recharge areas in the Waterloo Moraine, as designated by the Region of
Waterloo and included in their Draft Regional Official Plan (ROW, 2008a). This area generally
corresponds to the core area of the Waterloo Moraine, where ice-contact sand is present at surface, as
mapped by Karrow, (1987). Much of the area is also a topographic high within the core area of the
moraine and as a result, provides recharge on a regional scale (i.e. it is located near the top of the
groundwater flow system as shown in Figure 3.3.13 and Figure 3.3.16). As can be seen from the water
table slope, groundwater moves away from the topographic high, where the ice contact sand and gravel
is exposed at ground surface and recharges the aquifer system as well as providing water to surrounding
creeks. It is noted that much of the main recharge area is located outside the urban area.
Recharge rates were estimated as part the water budget work by GRCA, as discussed further in Section
5.6. As part of this work hydrologic response units were defined using the GAWSER model (GRCA,
2008). Hydrologic response units were developed and recharge rates estimated using factors such as:
surficial geology; slope; vegetation cover; and, drainage (open or closed). Figure 5.5.2 shows predicted
recharge rate from the GAWSER modelling (GRCA, 2008). The highest recharge rates are generally in
the area of the ice-contact sand in the core area of the Waterloo Moraine. Recharge rates of >500 mm/yr
are noted locally. Rates are predicted to be very high in closed depression areas (i.e. no surface
drainage outlet) in the ice-contact sand. High recharge rates are also noted south of the generally
interpreted boundary of the Waterloo Moraine, where recent investigations by the OGS suggest this area
may be an extension of the Waterloo Moraine.
          5.5.2   Water Supply
As discussed in detail in Section 3.3, the Waterloo Moraine provides the majority of water to the cities of
Kitchener and Waterloo, through the Region’s Integrated Urban System (IUS) of water supply. There are
also a number of well fields providing rural municipalities with water in the western portion of the Region.
February 2009                                  FINAL REPORT                                                48
 REVIEW OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE FOR THE WATERLOO AND PARIS/ GALT
MORAINES
As well, numerous private wells are located within the Waterloo Moraine. Figure 3.3.20, previously
discussed, shows the location of the municipal wells and well fields in the Waterloo Moraine. There are 10
active well fields as part of the IUS system, of which 7 of the well fields are within the urban areas. Three
of the well fields (Erb Street, Wilmot Centre and Mannheim West) are located to the west of the urban
areas, in the core area of the Waterloo Moraine. The urban municipal well fields represent about 70% of
the source capacity of the IUS system (>900 L/sec) while the rural municipal well fields represent about
30% (400 L/sec) of the source capacity of IUS water supply originating from the Waterloo Moraine.
Table 5.5.1 shows a summary of water production from municipal wells within the Waterloo Moraine
(Note that there are two currently operating well fields on the list (Woolner and Linwood) that are outside
the Waterloo Moraine boundary).
There are also six smaller individual water supply systems within the Waterloo Moraine currently
providing water to rural municipalities. The total water taking for these supplies is equivalent to about 2%
of the water taking in the IUS system.
Well head protection areas were developed for each of the municipal well fields. Figure 5.5.3 shows the
well head protection areas, as adopted by the region of Waterloo (Draft ROP, 2008), for wells within the
Waterloo Moraine. These well head protection areas cover a major portion of the main recharge area
and urban areas of Kitchener and Waterloo.
         5.5.3    Maintenance of Water-Related Ecological Features
The protection of water-related ecological features within the Region of Waterloo has been included in
Regional planning policies for many years. This was previously discussed in Section 3.3.2. The Region
has developed an ecosystem-based planning approach as part of previous Regional Official Plans. In
order to map and establish these ecological features a number of environmentally-related studies have
been conducted over the years, ranging from Region-wide ESPA studies and wetland evaluations to area
specific subwatershed studies. The Region, GRCA and local municipalities require subwatershed studies
to be conducted in areas of new development or growth. These studies have been on-going since 1989.
Subwatershed studies provide an ecosystem-based approach to land use planning on a subwatershed
scale. They integrate groundwater and surface water, aquatic and terrestrial habitat, and fisheries,
creating a broader understanding of the function and linkage of the natural ecologic systems. One of the
components of a subwatershed study is to provide a more detailed assessment of the ecologic features
with the subwatershed, in order to identify and protect these features from possible adverse impacts of
potential future land use changes or activities.
Figure 5.5.4 shows the Regional Environmentally Sensitive Policy Areas (ESPAs) found within the
Waterloo Moraine. Figure 5.5.5 shows the Provincially Significant Wetlands (PSWs) within the Waterloo
Moraine. It is noted that the majority of the wetlands are found in one area, in and around the upper
reaches of Laurel Creek. This area has been recently designated by the Region as an Environmentally
Sensitive Landscape (ESL). Figure 5.5.6 shows the fisheries resources in the Waterloo Moraine area, as
designated by the GRCA.
The following is highlighted with respect to water-related ecological features:
     •   Many of the water-related ecological features are found in and around the main recharge area, in
         the core of the Waterloo Moraine.
     •   Over 70 Provincially Significant Wetlands (PSW’s) have been mapped within the boundary of the
         Waterloo Moraine. Most of the wetlands are located within or adjacent to the upper reaches of
         the Laurel Creek subwatershed. The direct linkage between groundwater and surface water is

          not fully defined throughout this area. The downgradient wetlands are driven primarily by
          discharge, but wetlands in the upper areas may be the result of depressional features (i.e.
          hummocky terrain) collecting surface runoff, or they may be sustained by local groundwater
          discharge.
     •    The Waterloo Moraine provides water to the many PSWs in the Strasburg Creek subwatershed,
          located in a downgradient area of the Waterloo Moraine.
     •    Cold water fisheries and spawning areas have been mapped throughout the Waterloo Moraine.
          The main recharge area provides baseflow to many coldwater streams whose headwaters
          originate in the main recharge area, in particular: Alder Creek, Hunsberger Creek, Bamberg
          Creek and Laurel Creek. Cold water fisheries have also been mapped along the eastern flank of
          the Waterloo Moraine in Schneider Creek and Strasburg Creek. All of these creeks have been
          investigated as part of subwatershed studies or water taking assessments, with the exception of
          Bamberg Creek, which is only partially in the Waterloo Moraine and is far removed from urban
          development pressure.
     •    Many of the water-related ecological features are located outside the urban area. In the few
          areas where development pressure exists (e.g. southwest Kitchener and northwest Waterloo),
          more detailed studies are ongoing.
5.6    WATER QUANTITY/ WATER BUDGET
The GRCA and the Region of Waterloo have conducted water quantity and water budget assessments in
several different ways and at various scales. Much of this work has been related to Water Budget and
Water Quantity Risk Assessments, conducted as part of Source Protection studies. A water budget for
the Waterloo Moraine has not specifically been developed by the Region or the GRCA from these
studies, as most analyses have been conducted on a watershed and subwatershed scale rather than a
landform-specific scale. The Waterloo Moraine area is generally captured within these assessments.
Prior to the initiation of the Water Budget and Water Quantity Risk Assessments, the Region conducted
several studies and programs to aid in understanding water quantity and sustainable capacity of the
municipal water supply. As previously discussed in Sections 3.3 and 5.5.2, a groundwater flow model was
developed (WHI, 2000) to delineate well field capture zones within the Waterloo Moraine. The location of
the well and well fields modelled as part of that study was previously presented in Figure 3.3.16. The
primary purpose of the groundwater flow model was to establish a defensible 2-year and 10-year time-of-
travel capture zones (as discussed in Section 5.5.2). This required the development of a fully calibrated
groundwater flow model. As part of the calibration process, recharge rates were calibrated to infiltration
rates, based on direct recharge in high permeability areas and runoff from low permeability soils onto high
permeability soils. Recharge rates were established across the Waterloo Moraine modelled area.
Calibration of the model was performed by matching simulated water levels in the three aquifers with
existing water level data within each of these aquifers. Calibration to stream flows was performed for
major sections of the Grand River, Conestogo River and Nith River. More detailed estimates of stream
flow were conducted for portions of some of the major tributaries draining the Waterloo Moraine area.
The calibration was not a high level calibration due to low resolution in the digital elevation model and
limited field data in the upper reaches of a number of the tributaries. The overall water balance however
was considered reasonable for the scale of the study.
As part of a general assessment of a water balance in the Region of Waterloo, the Region monitors water
levels throughout the Region, focusing on well field areas. Although not specifically a water budget
assessment the Region uses this data to assess the impact of municipal pumping on water level changes
in the aquifer system (i.e. storage depletion) and discharge to local streams. Historical data exists on a
number of well fields, dating back decades. Typically though, there was often limited data collected

MORAINES
during the early years of well field pumping. Where historical data does exist, water level records show
that there was often a 5-10 m decline in water levels, near the production wells, during the early years of
pumping (Burnside, 2008), but the water levels have stabilized over time. The Region established a more
permanent groundwater monitoring network in the mid-1990s. These data provide a broad assessment
of the impact of water taking, as well as other factors (e.g. precipitation changes), on water levels
throughout the Region. Annual monitoring programs are conducted, collecting water level data and
synthesizing the data with pumping rates, precipitation and selected stream flows and presented in
annual monitoring reports (Burnside, 2008).
Figure 5.6.1 shows the locations of wells monitored within the Waterloo Moraine area (from Burnside
2008). Water levels are monitored in production wells, and dedicated monitoring wells within the three
aquifer system of the Waterloo Moraine. Several examples of the water level data collected are shown in
this report to indicate the type of data currently being collected. Figure 5.6.2 shows an example of a
water level hydrograph (from Burnside, 2008) for a production well (K50) at the Wilmot Centre Well Field,
located in the core area of the Waterloo Moraine. Figure 5.6.3 shows water level hydrographs for a
monitoring well nest located near the Wilmot Centre Well Field. In this example, the monitoring wells are
located in the pumped aquifer (shallow – WM14S-93 and deep – WM14I-93) and in the upper bedrock
(WM14D-93). Figure 5.6.4 shows an example of the historical water level data, dating back to 1989,
collected for a monitoring well near the Wilmot Centre Well Field.
Trends in these water levels have been analyzed by the Region as part of the monitoring program. Data
from the last 10 years shows there has been little change in water levels as result of current pumping of
the aquifer systems, indicating a relatively stable groundwater system.
More detailed water use analyses and water budget assessments have been conducted since 2005. In
2005, the MOE completed an analysis of water use in the main tertiary watersheds of the province
(AquaResource, 2005). This was done in support of revisions to the regulations for water taking permits.
A report was also prepared by the GRCA, assessing water use in the Grand River watershed (GRCA,
2005). The MOE work identified the upper part of the Grand River watershed, which includes the Region
of Waterloo, as a “medium-use” watershed. This means that in low-flow conditions 25-50% of the flow is
allocated for use, based on permitted water taking (not actual usage).
In order to provide a more detailed water budget assessment for the Region, since the Region is the
major water taker in the upper portion of the Grand River watershed, a more detailed assessment was
conducted, sub-dividing the Region into five subwatershed areas as shown in Figure 5.6.5. The majority
of the Waterloo Moraine area is encompassed by the Nith River subwatershed grouping and Laurel-
Schneider subwatershed-grouping. Table 5.6.1 shows the water balance summary for the five sub-
watersheds (Note that the infiltration rate is based on the GAWSER modelling performed by the GRCA).
Results of the 2005 analysis showed that there was high percentage of water use, 40.3%, in the Laurel-
Schneider sub-group, relative to the estimated infiltration within the area of the subwatershed group. As
indicated in the Region’s Water Resources Protection Master Plan (RMOW, 2008), the comparison of
infiltration to pumping for each subwatershed does not factor in “recharge” to the aquifer system from
outside the subwatershed area. A considerable volume of water recharging the Laurel-Schneider
subwatershed grouping originates from the main recharge area to the west, within the Nith River
subwatershed grouping. The combined water usage for the two subwatershed areas is about 24% of the
combined total estimated infiltration.
It is noted in the Burnside, 2008 report, that the GAWSER model was updated as part of the Tier 2 Water
Budget and Water Quantity Risk Assessment (discussed below), from modelling done in 2000. A
substantial increase in the estimated recharge values is noted in the Nith River subwatershed grouping,
which encompasses much of the core area of the Waterloo Moraine. Much of this increase is the result of

supply is interpreted to be substantially lower than previously estimated in the Nith River subwatershed
grouping, at about 10% of the estimated infiltration. The percentage water extracted by municipal
pumping for the combined subwatershed groupings is about 16% of the total estimated infiltration.
As part of the Province’s watershed-based source protection water budget and water quantity risk
assessments are required. The approach taken to develop a water budget is to take a tiered approached,
beginning with a large scale area and quantifying or refining the accuracy as the scale is reduced. As
discussed above, the GRCA performed a water use analysis at the watershed scale in 2005, to provide a
general assessment of a watershed-wide water budget. As part of a Tier 2 Water Budget and Water
Quantity Risk Assessment, the GRCA has refined their water budget modelling framework, which has
been on-going since the mid-1990s. The current refinement of GRCA’s water budget was carried out to
support the implementation of the Province of Ontario’s Clean Water Act, 2006 (AquaResource, 2008a).
The GRCA produced an integrated water budget report (AquaResource, 2008a) using a groundwater and
surface water model, and integrating these models through groundwater recharge and discharge
distribution. The work also included refining the water demand estimates. The main purpose was to
update the groundwater and surface modelling and develop water budgets on a subwatershed basis.
The Grand River watershed was divided into 18 subwatershed basins and water budgets estimated for
each area. A water budget assessment was also conducted for four “moraine assessment areas” within
the Grand River basin. Figure 3.3.1, previously presented, shows the Waterloo Moraine and other
moraine areas surrounding the Waterloo Moraine, considered part of the Central-West Moraine
assessment area.
On the basis of the findings of the water budget assessment as part of the Tier 2 study, more detailed
water budget and water quantity risk assessments were recommend for several area of increased stress.
The Regional Municipality of Waterloo was designated in the GRCA Tier 2 Water Budget Study as having
a moderate to significant potential for hydrologic stress. A Tier 3 Water Budget and Water Quantity Risk
Assessment study is currently being undertaking by the Region, scheduled for completion in 2010. The
area being studied includes the urban well fields within the Cities of Kitchener, Waterloo and Cambridge
as well as a few of the surrounding well fields, in particular some of the well fields within the core area of
the Waterloo Moraine, in areas that contribute recharge to the potentially stressed areas identified in the
Tier 2 study .
The goal of the Tier 3 Water Budget and Water Quantity Risk Assessment is to evaluate the sustainability
of the water supply system for the Region and identify potential threats to the long term municipal water
supplies. The Tier 3 Assessment will be centered on the development and refinement of the Water
Budget in the study area, using refined and updated numerical modelling tools, which include a
continuous GAWSER surface water model and the finite element FEFLOW groundwater model,
previously used in the Tier 2 study.
The Tier 3 Assessment is divided into 2 phases; 1), enhancement of the conceptual and numerical
models of the Region’s well fields; and 2), Risk Assessment, and evaluation of potential water quantity
threats. Field work is currently underway for the Phase 1 portion of the study and includes spot baseflow
data collection, as well as the installation and monitoring of mini-piezometers within surface water
features located near the municipal well fields under investigation. This portion of the study aims to
improve the overall understanding of the interaction between the municipal aquifers and the local surface
water features. A water level “snapshot” of available monitoring wells is also being completed to collect
representative water levels, across as much of the study area as possible for use in calibrating the
FEFLOW groundwater flow model. The study area encompasses much of the Waterloo Moraine area,
and almost the entire portion of the area where water quantity impacts could occur as a result of existing

land use activities (i.e. urbanization and municipal water taking). It is anticipated that the work will be
completed in 2010.
5.7    WATER QUALITY
The Region of Waterloo undertakes two separate water quality monitoring programs. The water supply
system is routinely monitored in accordance with the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act. These
data aid in assessing trends in water quality in the drinking water system. The Region also undertakes a
water quality monitoring program as part of its source protection activities at selected water supply wells
and monitoring wells throughout the aquifer system. The monitoring is used to provide additional
information within capture zones of well fields, as well as provide information on background water quality
and monitor water quality in areas of known groundwater contamination. Figure 5.7.1 shows locations of
monitoring wells sampled in the Waterloo Moraine area. The following highlights some of the findings of
the water quality monitoring program:
     •   Nitrate concentrations are elevated in several of the municipal wells in the core area of the
         Waterloo Moraine. This is a result of decades of nitrate loadings in agricultural areas. Water for
         these wells is obtained from Aquifer 1 in these areas and there is limited natural protection at
         ground surface. Several of the local well fields, supplying rural municipalities west of Kitchener
         and Waterloo, also have elevated nitrate concentrations. There is a “stratification” of nitrate, with
         a higher nitrate concentration in the upper portion of the Aquifer 1 in some areas. Some of the
         local municipal wells are currently not operational, or their rate of water taking is managed, to
         minimize the increase in nitrate concentration from the upper portion of Aquifer 1. Figure 5.7.2
         shows an example of the distribution of nitrate concentrations above 10 mg/L, in wells sampled
         within the Waterloo Moraine for 2005 (from Burnside, 2006).
     •   There has been an increase in sodium and chloride concentrations in a number of the urban well
         fields since the 1960’s, as a result of decades of road salt application on roads, sidewalks and
         parking lots. Several of the older well fields have sodium and chloride concentrations exceeding
         recommended drinking water guidelines in individual wells within the well field. The sodium and
         chloride loading is likely a combination of both a broad-scale migration of road salt-impacted
         water migrating down through the aquifer-aquitard system and a downward migration of road salt-
         impacted water through local “windows” in some of the aquitard units. Figure 5.7.3 shows an
         example of the range in concentrations of chloride, in wells sampled in the Waterloo Moraine in
         2005 (from Burnside, 2006).
     •   Several well fields have experienced local site-specific industrial contamination, in particular the
         Greenbrook Well Field and to a lesser extent the William Street Well Field. Although there
         appears to be considerable natural protection, it is likely that there are local “windows” in the
         aquitard units that have resulted in the downward migration of contaminants. The contaminant
         sources are from old industrial sites. These well fields also have the high sodium and chloride
         concentrations.
As part of the Region’s Source Protection initiatives, the Region has developed Well Head Protection
Areas, delineated vulnerable areas, compiled a threats inventory database and a list of threats within Well
Head Protections Areas. The Region has also developed a risk management program to rank potential
risks and developed a risk reduction program. The Source Protection program is summarized in the next
section.
The Region has also been actively involved in a number of pro-active initiatives to minimize the risk of
contaminants entering the groundwater system (ROW, 2008) including, but not limited to:
     •   implementation of a Rural Water Quality Program (with GRCA and OMFRA);

     •   conducting a “Road Salt Management and Chloride Reduction Study” and implementation of a
         Region-wide road salt reduction initiatives;
     •   development of nitrate reduction strategies at a rural well field; and,
     •   implementation of aggregate extraction policies to minimize aquifer vulnerability impacts within
         well head protection areas.
5.8    SUMMARY OF TECHNICAL SOURCE PROTECTION STUDIES
As indicated in previous sections, the Region of Waterloo has been actively involved with water resources
protection for many years. The Region has been implementing a Water Resources Protection Strategy
since 1993, to minimize the risk of historic, existing and future land use activities on municipal water
supplies. In 2003, the Region in partnership with the GRCA was awarded funding from the MOE
“Operation Clean Water Municipal Groundwater Study Initiative”, (ROW, 2008). One of the main
components of the work was to develop a new ten-year Water Resources Master Plan, updating the
existing Master Plan and incorporating new initiatives and policies developed by the Province of Ontario,
including the Clean Water Act and related regulations. The following is a summary of the various studies
and initiatives that have been completed or on-going, within the Region of Waterloo:
     •   Groundwater Mapping and Aquifer Vulnerability Assessment – The Region has delineated well
         head protection areas for all of their groundwater supply wells using a Regional-scale
         groundwater flow model. Capture zones have been delineated and “Well Head Protection Areas”
         assigned levels of “sensitivity”. These areas have been updated, or are currently being updated,
         to integrate with the Source Protection Groundwater Vulnerability Analysis (i.e. Guidance Module
         3).
     •   Delineation of Surface Water Intake Protection Areas – The Region has completed a study to
         delineate Inland Protection Zones and Total Water Contributing Area for the Hidden Valley Intake
         on the Grand River.
     •   Groundwater Use Inventory and Assessment – These studies include an MOE water-use
         assessment and a Region water-use assessment. As previously indicated, a Tier 2 Water
         Budget and Risk Assessment Analysis has been completed and a Tier 3 Water Budget and Risk
         Assessment Analysis is currently being conducted for the Laurel/Schneider Creek group of
         subwatersheds.
     •   Region-scale Assessment of Potential Contaminant Sources – A reconnaissance level survey of
         sites that pose a potential threat to water supplies was conducted in 1996 and detailed studies
         completed in 1997 and 1998. A Threats Inventory Database (TID) was developed by the Region
         and ranking of each threat developed to provide a relative ranking of the threat to water
         resources. This information is being updated as part of the Source Protection Threats Inventory
         Assessment and Issues Evaluation (i.e. Guidance Module 5).
     •   Risk Reduction Programs and Tools – The Region has implemented, or is proposing to
         implement a number of Risk-Mitigation Measures for existing and future threats to municipal wells
         within the different Well Head Protection Sensitivity Areas. Threat categories such as:
         contaminated sites; winter maintenance; agriculture nutrient application; impervious cover
         increase; and, aggregate extraction are addressed with various risk reduction measures
         proposed for each category.

6.0        Current Understanding of the Paris/ Galt Moraines
6.1     OVERVIEW
In terms of assessing an understanding of the Paris/ Galt Moraine system the limited data availability and
subsequent geological and hydrogeological interpretation was discussed in Section 3.4. The following
sections present a summary of the current understanding of the Paris/ Galt Moraines.
6.2     GEOLOGY AND HYDROSTRATIGRAPHY
          6.2.1    Paris/ Galt Moraine Boundary
Mapping provided by the MOE for this study, showing the location of the Paris/ Galt Moraines (Figure
3.4.1.1), was based on information from several existing documents, including the following:
      •   GRCA Watershed Report, 2005 – Page 9, Moraine areas map, under the heading “Natural Areas:
          Moraines are the backbone of the Grand”;
      •   Protecting Significant Moraines in Waterloo Region, A Supplementary Report in Support of
          Waterloo Region’s Growth Management Strategy, prepared by: Planning, Housing and
          Community Services, Grand River Conservation Authority, and Meridian Planning Consultants
          Inc.; and,
      •   Aquifer Characterization and Capture Zone Delineation for the Region of Waterloo, prepared by
          Waterloo Hydrogeologic Inc.
Using the above noted mapping as reference maps, the OGS Surficial Geology data from 2003 was then
utilized, specifically the GIS layers called sgu_mor and sgu_poly and the selected polygon features from
both data sets that corresponded to the features on the reference maps. In addition, any features with
Paris Moraine or Galt Moraine within the annotation layer included with the surficial geology data were
also used.
The moraine footprint for the current study was derived primarily relying on areas mapped as hummocky
terrain, from surficial geology mapping. A comparison of the hummocky terrain mapping, to either the
physiography or the Quaternary geology mapping, will show variations in the boundary features when
compared to the mapping provided by MOE.
In the Caledon Hills area a portion of the Paris Moraine, north of Caldwell, (White 1975, Map 2275) is not
shown on the current moraine footprint. This area is presented on the physiographic layer of the map as
an elongated till moraine area just north of the furthest extent of the current Paris Moraine footprint.
A comment on the moraine boundary issue, from Ross Kelly (pers. Com) at the OGS, provides additional
insight:
“The compilation that the OGS did in 2003 and which has been used for outlining moraines by some
people does not outline moraines explicitly. We created a layer termed "hummocky topography" in the
2003 compilation that incorporated areas mapped as hummocky topography outlined on the old 1:50 000
hard copy maps. Some geologists outlined areas of hummocky topography while others didn't. That is
why you will see boundary faults on the hummocky topography layer… As moraines generally consist of
"hummocky topography" the layer provides an approximate outline of moraines but it should not be
considered definitive. That is why there are little blobs sticking out on the Wellington County Moraines

map and others. These little "blobs" are just areas of hummocky topography and may or may not be
related to specific moraines. Another alternative is to use the Chapman and Putnam physiography maps
that we (OGS) made digital in 2007. The outline of the moraines portrayed on the C and P maps is
different from the "hummocky topography" moraines that have been outlined.”
Within a hydrogeological context the boundary should likely reflect the following:
     •   the hummocky topography;
     •   the recharge/discharge function in particular the local discharge function; and,
     •   the Wentworth Till cap.
         6.2.2     Geology and Hydrostratigraphy
The Paris Moraine was formed during an advance and stagnation of the Ontario ice lobe approximately
12-13,000 years ago (Karrow, 1968: Cowan, 1972; White, 1975; Bajc, 2007). The formation of the Galt
Moraine was generally interpreted to occur as a result of a subsequent retreat and stagnation, or a retreat
and re-advance and stagnation, of the Ontario ice lobe (Karrow 1968; White 1975). Various reports differ
as to whether these glacial events happened during the Port Huron Stadial or the Port Bruce Stadial. Bajc
and Karrow (1994) presented the following discussion:
The Paris and Galt moraines are now believed to be correlated in age to the Oak Ridges Moraine north of
Lake Ontario, and the Singhampton and Gibraltar moraines south of Georgian Bay. Barnett (1984, 1991)
suggested that the Paris and Galt moraines formed in response to a period of readjustment of the Erie-
Ontario ice lobe margin during the Mackinaw Phase; an observation that agrees with those proposed by
Taylor in his initial investigation. Evidence for a local readvance of the ice margin occurs in isolated areas
to the north but is lacking to the south where the ice margin was fronted by a large glacial lake. The
extent to which ice retreat occurred prior to the readvance is not known.
Extensive glaciofluvial deposits following low tracts of land in front of and between the moraines flowed
southward toward the Lake Erie basin where a large glaciolacustrine delta was constructed at the
Jacksonburg level. The source of these deposits may be, in part, attributed to the release of subglacial
meltwaters that carved large tunnel valleys north of the Oak Ridges Moraine. Detrital organic remains
recovered from the deltaic sediments in front of the Galt Moraine were radiocarbon dated at 13.4 ka BP
(Barnett, 1985) and provide one of the most reliable dates on the age of the Mackinaw Phase. Bog
bottom dates from kettle depressions within the moraine range between 11.95 and 5.78 ka BP and only
provide minimum deglaciation dates for the moraines.
The primary composition of the Paris/ Galt Moraines is the Wentworth Till. Within the moraines, the
Wentworth Till is generally characterized as a brown to reddish brown silty sand or sandy silt till. The
Wentworth Till is relatively coarse-grained and varies in composition along the moraine generally
becoming finer-grained to the south (White, 1975), due to the incorporation of glaciolacustrine basinal
clays (Bajc and Karrow, 2004). The Wentworth Till in the Till plains adjacent and distal to the moraines is
generally finer grained (Karrow, 1968). The coarser-grained nature of the till within the moraines varies
and is interpreted as being dependent on more local inclusions of permeable kame deposits or outwash,
and the reworking of these more permeable deposits during minor glacial re-advances (Karrow, 1968;
Karrow, 1987). Barnett (1978) referenced a description of the Paris/ Galt Moraines by Dreimanis (1961)
as follows: “the Paris and Galt Moraines serve as good examples of the influence of incorporated non-
consolidated glacial sediments.”

 REVIEW OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE FOR THE WATERLOO AND PARIS/ GALT
MORAINES
Within the Credit Valley watershed the Paris Moraine provides the relief (30-40m) for the headwaters of
Silver Creek, the West Credit River and the Credit River from Cheltenham to Glen Williams. The Paris/
Galt Moraines provide relief for the headwaters of Black Creek and make up the boundary between the
Credit River watershed and the Grand River watershed. Outwash sand and gravel is extensive off the
northern flank of the Paris Moraine towards the Village of Erin. Within Black Creek, and moving
southeasterly, the Paris and Galt Moraines are inseparable and are up to 8 km wide. It is noted that the
moraines in this area have pockets of glaciofluvial sediment (White, 1975) and may contain a core of
stratified drift (Cowan, 1976; CVC, 2008). The area also contains numerous boggy kettles and wetlands
(Cowan, 1976; CVC, 2008). The Wentworth Till cap throughout the area is noted to be 1-15 metres thick
(CVC, 2008).
Continuing on to the southwest from the Credit River watershed, the Paris/ Galt Moraines remain
relatively inseparable (Blue Springs Creek provides some separation) until the Aberfoyle area, where a
major outwash channel separates them for about 10 km. At some locations the outwash channel is up to
4 km wide (Figure 3.4.1.2). Farther along, smaller spillways, including those associated with lower Mill
and Moffat Creeks, separate the moraines.
Through the Guelph-Cambridge area the Galt Moraine forms a continuous ridge but the Paris Moraine is
absent between the Shades Mills Conservation Area and the Pinehurst Lake Conservation Area. The
moraine in this area may be buried by the significant outwash deposits or may have been eroded away
(Karrow, 1997). This major outwash was deposited as the ice remained stagnant at the edge of the Paris
Moraine (Karrow, 1997). The Wentworth Till is quite sandy from north of Acton down through Cambridge
and the moraine structure commonly has permeable kame deposits associated with it (Karrow, 1997;
Karrow, 1998). They are more common in the Paris Moraine and likely reflects greater melting at the ice
front. A complex internal structure with till units, sand and silt lenses and discontinuous sand and gravel
is also common (Golder, 2006a; Golder, 2006b). Kettles and kettle lakes (e.g. Puslinch Lake) are more
common on the Paris Moraine and tend to indicate abundant meltwater (Karrow, 1987). Kettles are less
abundant on the Galt Moraine. Swamps and bogs are also common on the Paris Moraine and within the
outwash in front of the Galt Moraine (Karrow, 1987; Golder, 2006b). The moraine relief in this area is on
the order of 20-30m.
Existing stratigraphic cross-sections through the Galt/Paris Moraines were found to be limited in the
reports that were reviewed. Two examples are shown in Figures 6.2.1 and Figure 6.2.2. Figure 6.2.1
(CG&S, 1996) shows a hydrostratigraphic cross-section through Mill Creek from north to south, in the
area of Aberfoyle. Note the extensive more permeable material within the Paris Moraine, the outwash
channel and to a slightly lesser extent within the Galt Moraine. Also note a less permeable unit above the
bedrock, which is likely the Port Stanley Till (CG&S, 1996). Figure 6.2.2 (Lotowater, 1997) is a north to
south stratigraphic cross-section just west of Puslinch Lake south to Highway 6. The cross-section shows
the Wentworth Till and the abundance of more permeable sand and gravel below the surficial till unit. The
more permeable sand and gravel does not appear to extend completely into the Galt Moraine. As well, a
less permeable till (Port Stanley Till) is present at the bedrock contact. The Port Stanley Till is noted in
most reports within the Guelph/Cambridge area, although it may not be a continuous unit. The
overburden thickness throughout the Guelph and Cambridge area can be on the order of 30-40m. Figure
6.2.3 presents a cross-section in the Eramosa River-Blue Springs Creek area (Stantec, 1999).
Moving southerly through to Paris, the moraines become narrower and more subdued, with relief on the
order of 10-20m (Cowan, 1972). The Moraines are also discontinuous at ground surface and appear to be
buried by younger sediments in some areas. Kame cores are associated with the moraines in this area
(Cowan, 1972). The Galt Moraine is absent west of Brantford and reappears north of Waterford (Barnett,
1978). Major glaciolacustrine sand deposits, or outwash and deltaic sand and gravel deposits, are
adjacent to, or separate the moraines (Figure 3.4.1.2). Drilling by the OGS north of Oakland, along the

margin of the Galt Moraine, encountered 41 metres of well-bedded sand and gravel with lesser silt and
clay. The preliminary interpretation of the drilling results suggests a subaquatic fan depositional
environment with coalescing fan lobes (Bajc, 2008). Moving south along the Paris/ Galt Moraines, the
Wentworth Till becomes more fine-grained and the relief far more subdued (Burnett, 1978). The Moffat
Moraine rides in behind the Galt Moraine and is almost coincident with it southwest of Brantford. The
Paris Moraine is mapped through to Delhi but is basically nonexistent through to Lake Erie. The Galt
Moraine is absent from Waterford on down to Lake Erie. In both case the moraines are likely buried under
the extensive glaciolacustrine and glaciofluvial sand deposits and in both cases very minor pockets of
Wentworth Till may exist a ground surface (Lake Erie Source Protection Report, 2008).
In summary, within a hydrostratigraphic context, the following general opinions or interpretations have
been put forward in the literature concerning the Paris/ Galt Moraines:
     •   The Wentworth Till cap is a relatively consistent unit although it is generally more fine-grained to
         the south. Locally, areas of the Wentworth Till may be coarser-grained (more permeable) or finer-
         grained (less permeable).
     •   The internal structure is a complex mixture of till, stratified drift and discontinuous layers of more
         permeable material. Locally, this permeable material may be continuous.
     •   The Galt Moraine may contain less permeable core material and is generally less hummocky,
         compared to the Paris Moraine.
     •   There may exist a less permeable till unit above the bedrock, but below the more permeable
         material found in the core of the moraines. The continuity of this unit is likely variable.
6.3     SIGNIFICANT AQUIFERS
The large-scale aquifer potential within the Paris/ Galt Moraine overburden area, as presented in the
literature, is basically limited to the adjacent meltwater channel sand and gravel deposits (e.g. Erin,
Acton, Puslinch and Cambridge areas). The one notable exception is the interpretation of an aquifer unit
within the Galt Moraine in the vicinity of St. George (AquaResource, 2008a). This was noted during the
current OGS drilling program (Bajc, 2008). The permeable deposits within the moraines do support
private wells and a small number of communal wells (CVC, 2002; Golder, 2006a, b; CG&S 1996;
AquaResource, 2008a). Major aquifers exist in the underlying bedrock, particularly in the Guelph and
Amabel Formations.
As discussed previously, south of St. George the Paris/ Galt Moraines become more subdued, are less
connected and eventually disappear. The moraines become finer grained to the south. The local
overburden aquifer in this area is the adjacent outwash (e.g. Paris and Brantford area) or more regionally,
the Norfolk Sand Plain.
Generally there are more private wells in the underlying bedrock than the overburden within the moraine
footprints in the CVC and GRCA watersheds. This likely reflects the more consistent water producing
capability in the upper bedrock. The limiting factor for water supply wells in the overburden is a lack of a
continuous permeable overburden unit. Figure 6.3.1 provides a comparison between the number
overburden and bedrock wells within in the County of Wellington portion of the Paris/ Galt Moraines.
Figure 6.3.2 provides the well types for the CVC. Both show a predominance of bedrock wells within the
area of the Paris/ Galt Moraines.
The Guelph-Puslinch Groundwater Study (Golder, 2006a) concluded that even though there were a large
number wells throughout the area it was not possible to interpret individual aquifer units within the Paris/
Galt Moraines.

 REVIEW OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE FOR THE WATERLOO AND PARIS/ GALT
MORAINES
It is important to note that when dealing with a complex stratigraphy as described above there may be
hydraulic interconnections between what appear to be discrete sand lenses and therefore, the potential
for larger-scale but still more localized groundwater production zones. This reflects the possible limitations
of a three-dimensional hydrostratigraphic quantification of this type of ice-contact environment, based
solely on geologic stratigraphy.
The underlying bedrock dolostone aquifer and the overlying overburden local aquifers may or may not be
connected. Aquitards of fine-grained material (e.g. Port Stanley Till) may hydraulically separate these
aquifer units. The hydraulic connection between the bedrock and overburden of the Paris/ Galt Moraines
is not well known, based on the information in the reports reviewed for this study.
6.4     SIGNIFICANCE AND FUNCTIONS OF THE PARIS/ GALT MORAINES
         6.4.1    Recharge
The recharge function has been one of the major hydrogeologic characteristics discussed for the Paris/
Galt Moraines. It is generally interpreted or perceived that till, by nature, should have a low permeability
therefore a relatively lower recharge potential as compared to say a medium sand. In the case of the
Paris/ Galt Moraines the till is generally sandy in composition. In addition, the hummocky nature of the
moraines gives rise to closed depressions which can collect runoff, which can lead to a higher recharge
potential, depending on the permeability of the surficial unit within the depressions. This factor was
presented in Karrow, 1968.
These two basic components have been factored into estimating recharge potential and more recently
into groundwater/surface water modeling and water budget calibration. As a result, current recharge
values for the Paris/ Galt Moraines vary from 100-360 mm/year but are usually interpreted to be the
higher end (CVC, 2008; Davies and Holysh, 2007; AquaResource, 2008a/b; LESPR, 2008). The
hummocky portions of the moraine are commonly reflected as significant recharge areas. Figure 6.4.1.1
shows estimated recharge distribution in GRCA watershed (LESPR, 2008).
The closed depressional nature of the hummocky terrain must be considered within a scalar context when
looking at depression-focused recharge. A number of the depressions may be connected on a smaller
scale and eventually direct surface runoff towards an endpoint for recharge within the hummocky terrain
or to the more permeable outwash on the lower slopes. Within this framework, the overland flow and
hummocky terrain may create highly localized recharge areas, which may dominate recharge to the
groundwater flow system.
The recharge into the Paris/ Galt Moraines provides for the hydraulic head to move water into the
underlying bedrock, where hydraulically connected. Depending on the flow pathways, this water may
discharge to reaches of adjacent streams or into local wetlands (CVC 2008; Golder 2006a; LESPR 2008;
CG&S 1996).
         6.4.2    Water Supply
Municipal water supplies found in proximity to the Paris/ Galt Moraines are almost solely confined to
deeper bedrock aquifers, except for the Paris municipal water supply. On the full scale of the Paris/ Galt
Moraines, only a very small portion of these moraines is subject to capture of water from municipal supply
wells.
 Municipal wells adjacent to the Paris/ Galt Moraines and their respective capture zones for Acton and
Guelph are presented in Figures 6.4.2.1 and 6.4.2.2. The Acton municipal well capture zones extend

MORAINES
under the Paris Moraine to the north. The Guelph capture zones extend under the Paris Moraine to the
northeast. The capture zones of Cambridge wells, in the vicinity of the Galt Moraine, are not known to
extend under the moraine. The municipal wells in Paris, adjacent to the Paris Moraine, are a combination
of both overburden and bedrock wells, with capture zones extending within the permeable sediments,
adjacent to or part of the Paris Moraine (Lotowater, 1997).
The Region of Halton, City of Guelph and Region of Waterloo are currently undertaking Tier 3 Water
Budget and Water Quantity Risk Assessments (Section 6.7). The areas of these assessments will
include consideration of the Paris/ Galt Moraines. Groundwater flow modelling specific to the capture
zones, reflecting areas under the Paris/ Galt Moraine and the effect on the moraine flow system, is
expected to be addressed during the Tier 3 studies for the City of Guelph and the Region of Waterloo.
The terms of reference for the Acton Tier 3 study have not been finalized.
Water supply for domestic purposes was found to be sufficient, utilizing both the local overburden
aquifers and the underlying bedrock. Use of groundwater for agricultural purposes (e.g. mainly tobacco
irrigation) was greatest in the southern portion of the Paris/ Galt Moraine study area, but the wells
appeared to be mainly within the adjacent Norfolk Sand Plain. Areas where agricultural wells may have
been located within the potential buried portions Paris/ Galt Moraine were not determined within the
scope of this study. There were no specific references to groundwater shortages for agricultural use,
within the Paris/ Galt Moraines.
          6.4.3    Maintenance of Water-Related Ecological Features
The maintenance of baseflow for coldwater streams is often a major focus in many subwatershed studies.
At the subwatershed level of study it is common to obtain field baseflow measurements for groundwater
balances (CVC 1998; CG&S 1996; Golder 2006a) and as input parameters for groundwater and surface
water model calibration (AquaResource 2008a; CVC 2008). Determining the area of recharge contributing
to groundwater discharge is generally carried out on a coarse scale in watershed models.
Groundwater flow modelling, to look at impacts on baseflow due to reductions in recharge from
unmitigated urban development or changes to the groundwater flow system resulting from unmitigated
aggregate extraction within the Aberfoyle outwash, was carried out for various recharge reduction and
extraction scenarios (CG&S 1996; Golder 2006b). The results were summarized as follows:
“The groundwater model was also used to examine (in a conceptual manner) the sensitivity of the
groundwater flow system to below water table aggregate extraction operations in the Mill Creek area.
The modelling results indicate that below-water table aggregate extraction has the potential to
temporarily affect groundwater flow directions and reduce baseflow to area watercourses as
groundwater inflows to replace the volume of aggregate materials during extraction. At closure,
following the completion of extraction operations, groundwater flow directions and water budgets may
be locally affected. However, while the potential for these impacts has been demonstrated in a generic
manner with the model, the actual impacts of these operations would have to be assessed on a site
specific basis, and in the context of specific criteria established for surface water features that are in
the vicinity of the operations.
     The effects of a reduction in recharge were also considered using the 3-dimensional model (again, in
a conceptual manner only). In the event that extensive development occurred across the Paris
Moraine, recharge could be reduced because of paved surfaces and storm sewers. The potential
impact of this was assessed in the model by reducing the amount of recharge over the moraine
footprint in increments of 10%, 20%, 30% and 40%. The modelling results indicated, as expected, that
a reduction in recharge into the moraine results in a reduction in groundwater discharge (baseflow)
February 2009                                  FINAL REPORT                                              60

MORAINES
to the surface watercourses in the area. The greatest sensitivity (given the assumed footprint of
recharge reduction) was observed for Irish Creek, where a 10% reduction in the recharge resulted in a
20% reduction in the simulated baseflow at Irish Creek. In comparison, a similar reduction in recharge
resulted in an 8% reduction in the simulated baseflow for Mill Creek at Side Road 10. While the
reduced recharge rates did not affect regional groundwater patterns, groundwater elevations in the
moraine were simulated to have dropped 1 to 4 metres for recharge reductions of 10% to 40%,
respectively. As described earlier, while the model demonstrates the potential impacts associated
with reduced recharge, actual impacts would have to be assessed on a site specific (or development
specific) basis.”
There are a significant number of gravel pits associated with the outwash sands and gravels related to
the Paris/ Galt Moraines (Figure 6.4.3.1). The individual reports were not reviewed for this study,
however a detailed peer review was previously performed for DFO to assess the groundwater/fisheries
impact from a group of localized below the water table aggregate operations in the Township of Puslinch
(Blackport and Portt; 2002). The review focused on the changes to the groundwater flow system,
groundwater discharge and the impacts on the local fish habitat for Mill and MacCrimmon Creeks. The
study basically concluded that the were modifications to the local water table but no significant changes in
overall reach baseflow or subsequent impacts on fish habitat, based on the existing data and natural
trends. The potential for impacts on local baseflow may be increased with future expansion of the
aggregate operations but can be minimized with appropriate design and operation practices. It was
qualified in the report that these general conclusions were to be refined and confirmed with ongoing
monitoring.
It is noted that hummocky topography can gives rise to local wetlands within the depressional areas. The
maintenance and assessment of the groundwater function for ecological features are standard
components of all current subwatershed and follow-up site specific studies, regardless of the
physiographic feature(s).
Recharge into the Paris/ Galt Moraines, and the subsequent groundwater flow, is interpreted to provide
significant groundwater discharge to reaches of the Eramosa River/Blue Springs Creek (Stantec, 1999),
Mill Creek (CH2M-Hill, 1996) and reaches along the Grand River in Cambridge. Coldwater reaches of the
streams on and adjacent to the Paris/ Galt Moraines have not been fully quantified.
Groundwater storage within the Paris/ Galt Moraines is likely significant in providing a level of resilience
for associated groundwater discharge on a seasonal basis and during extended drought periods.
6.5     WATER QUANTITY/ WATER BUDGET
Within a water quantity context, Section 6.3 showed the location of water wells within the overburden and
the bedrock. The specific capacities for the overburden and bedrock wells, based on the MOE water well
database, were quite consistent throughout the reports. The specific capacity of both sets of wells, were,
on average, between 2.0 and 5.0 IGPM/ft (CVC 2008; Golder 2006b; Golder 2006a) but, as discussed
above, more wells were completed in the bedrock than the overburden.
The quantification for water budget and water use was not specifically conducted for the Paris/ Galt
Moraines in the larger scale reports (See Section 6.1). The Mill Creek Subwatershed Plan (CG&S 1996)
performed an impact assessment on the water budget as discussed above. Water budgets for smaller
scale subcatchments are commonly carried out at the block plan stage where development is occurring.
Water quantity or water storage within the saturated units can be assessed by looking at trends in water
level hydrographs. Some monitoring wells exist for the Paris/ Galt Moraine area, including PGMN wells
(Figure 6.5.1) and a detailed monitoring program for the Township of Puslinch (Figure 6.5.2). Figure
February 2009                                 FINAL REPORT                                                   61

MORAINES
6.5.3 shows the hydrograph for PGMN well GA-20. Figure 6.5.4 shows two hydrographs for the Paris/
Galt Moraines, from the Township of Puslinch Monitoring Program. The hydrographs demonstrate the
seasonal variations in water levels. The long term trend shows no overall increase or decrease in water
levels.
The detailed review for DFO described above (Blackport and Portt, 2002) did not indicate any significant
impacts on the groundwater flow systems, related linkages to surface water and wetlands or the water
budget as a result of aggregate extraction in outwash areas adjacent to the Paris/ Galt Moraines.
6.6     WATER QUALITY
The water quality within the overburden and bedrock is presented in general terms within a majority of the
reports. The water in both the overburden and bedrock (Guelph Amabel Formations) is generally hard
with higher iron in the bedrock and slightly lower hardness in the outwash sand and gravel. The only
reference within the Paris/ Galt Moraines related to contamination from a surface source, was elevated
nitrate levels (Golder 2006a) which is likely the result local septic systems or agriculture and elevated
sodium possibly from road salt or septic systems (Golder 2006a). The monitoring sites for this study are
shown in Figure 6.5.4.
Potential contaminant sources for the Guelph-Puslinch Study are shown on Figure 6.5.5. The majority
are related to agriculture for the Paris/ Galt Moraines but there are relatively few sources.
Both rural and urban threats inventories were carried out for the Region of Waterloo and include the
Cambridge area of the moraines.
The detailed review for DFO, previously described above, did not indicate any significant impacts on the
groundwater quality. Thermal plumes from below water aggregate extraction were found to be attenuated
within a short travel distance in the groundwater (i.e. less than 200 metres).
6.7     SUMMARY OF TECHNICAL SOURCE PROTECTION STUDIES
          6.7.1   GRCA Tier 2 Water Budget
The GRCA Tier 2 Water Budget utilized available numerical models, specifically a continuous surface
water model (GAWSER) and a steady-state three-dimensional groundwater model (FEFLOW) to quantify
the individual water budget components (AquaResource, 2008a). The demand estimates of the water
budget were refined by building upon previous work carried out by the GRCA and AquaResource, which
involved interviewing and surveying permit to take water permit holders on their actual water usage.
Monthly consumptive water use rates were then estimated for each permit by applying seasonal and
consumption factors; consumptive rates are estimates of the volume of water that is not returned to the
original source it is extracted from, by the water taking operation. While less significant from a quantity
perspective than permitted takings, non-permitted takings such as rural residential or livestock watering,
were also accounted for in the water demand estimates.
A draft of the Tier 2 Water Budget report was completed in 2008 by AquaResource Inc. (2008a), and
underwent a peer review by external experts, as well as technical members of the Lake Erie Source
Protection Region. A draft of this report is available at the following website;
http://www.sourcewater.ca/index/document.cfm?Sec=7&Sub1=6&Sub2=5. The water budget estimated
approximately 60% of the water flowing through the GRCA Watershed exists as surface water runoff,
while 40 per cent flows through the groundwater system. The majority of groundwater flow (~85%) re-
surfaces within the watershed as baseflow discharge into rivers, creeks and wetlands, an estimated 8%

discharges to areas outside of the watershed. At the watershed scale, groundwater extraction accounts
for approximately 10% of the total groundwater flow in the watershed (AquaResource, 2008a).
Aside from the quantification of the Water Budget components, the study also included a Stress
Assessment that involved calculating the level of potential hydrologic stress within each of the
subwatersheds within the GRCA. As outlined in the Province’s Water Budget Guidance Module, those
subwatersheds that are deemed to be under moderate or significant hydrologic stress are required to
undertake a more detailed and refined Tier 3 Water Budget Assessment. Within the GRCA, the Region
of Waterloo and the City of Guelph were identified as having water supply systems that have a moderate
to significant potential for hydrologic stressed, and as such are currently undertaking Tier 3 Water Budget
Pilot Projects with funding provided by the Province.
          6.7.2   Long Point Region, Kettle Creek and Catfish Creek Tier 2 Water Budget
The Lake Erie Source Protection Region also conducted a Tier 2 Water Budget study within the Long
Point, Kettle Creek and Catfish Creek subwatersheds. The tools used for the study included a continuous
surface water model (GAWSER) and a steady-state three-dimensional groundwater model (FEFLOW) to
quantify the individual water budget components (AquaResource, 2008b). The process carried out to
estimate the water demands and other water budget components were estimated using the process
outlined in the Province’s Water Budget Guidance module (MOE, 2007), and are consistent with Tier 2
studies completed for the GRCA and CVC (latter is discussed below).
A draft of the Tier 2 Water Budget report was completed in 2008 by AquaResource Inc., and underwent a
peer review by external experts, as well as technical members of the Lake Erie Source Protection Region.
The Water Budget and Stress Assessment underwent internal review by the Source Protection Region
and their peer reviewers and comments on the document are currently being addressed by
AquaResource Inc. An updated report is anticipated to be re-submitted to the Source Protection Region
in early 2009.
          6.7.3   CVC Tier 2 Water Budget
Similar to the Tier 2 Water Budgets projects described above, the Credit Valley Conservation Authority
(CVC) also recently completed a Tier 2 Integrated Water Budget report for the CTC (CVC- TRCA-
CLOCA) Source Protection Region (AquaResource, 2008c). Individual water budget components were
analyzed on a subwatershed scale across the Watershed using the CVC’s continuous surface water
model (HSP-F) and their three-dimensional groundwater model (FEFLOW).
Estimates of water demand were refined using the Province’s Permit to Take Water database, as well as
actual water use values obtained from earlier surveyed results collected by the MOE and CVC. The
estimates were refined using monthly consumptive water use rates for each permit by applying seasonal
and consumption factors, and non-permitted water takings such as rural residential takings were also
included in the water demand estimates.
The Tier 2 Study also included a Subwatershed Stress Assessment that involved calculating the level of
potential hydrologic stress within each of the subwatersheds within the Credit River Watershed. As
outlined in the Province’s Water Budget Guidance Module, those subwatersheds that are deemed to have
a moderate or significant hydrologic stress are required to undertake a more detailed and refined Tier 3
Water Budget Assessment. Within the CVC, the Town of Orangeville (Subwatershed 19) and the Region
of Halton (Subwatersheds 10 and 11) were identified as having water supply systems that have a

moderate to significant potential for hydrologic stressed, and as such, these municipalities are currently
undertaking Tier 3 Water Budget Pilot Projects with funding provided by the Province.
A draft of the Tier 2 Water Budget report was completed in 2007, and it subsequently underwent a peer
review by external experts, as well as technical members of the CTC Source Protection Region. A draft
of this report was recently made available to the Source Protection Region and the peer review team for
their final review in October, 2008.

The Tier 2 Water Budget is at the Draft Proposal Stage and there is no further information.
          6.7.5    Region of Waterloo Tier 3 Water Budget
The Regional of Waterloo is currently undertaking a Tier 3 Water Budget and Water Quantity Risk
Assessment as the Region was designated in the GRCA Tier 2 Water Budget Study as having a
moderate to significant potential for hydrologic stress. The area being studied includes the urban well
fields within the Cities of Kitchener, Waterloo and Cambridge as well as a few of the surrounding well
fields. The goal of the Tier 3 Assessment is to evaluate the sustainability of the water supply system for
the Region and identify potential threats to the long term municipal water supplies. The Assessment will
be centered on the development and refinement of the Water Budget in the area using refined and
updated numerical modelling tools, which include a continuous GAWSER surface water model, and finite
element FEFLOW groundwater model.
The Tier 3 Assessment was divided into 2 phases; 1) Enhancement of the conceptual and numerical
models of the Region’s well fields; and, 2) Risk Assessment, and evaluation of potential water quantity
threats. The Study is currently focusing on the first task and this involves the following key deliverables;
      •   Updated hydrogeologic database;
      •   Conceptual Model Report, including a refined hydrogeologic characterization of the Region’s well
          fields within the Study Area;
      •   Updated groundwater and surface water modelling tools, refined around the Region’s well fields
          within the Study Area; and,
      •   Water Budget Report, incorporating the results of the refined modelling tools.
Field work being completed for the Phase 1 portion of the Study includes spot baseflow data collection
within the Region, as well as the installation and monitoring of mini-piezometers within surface water
features located near the municipal well fields under investigation. This work aims to improve the overall
understanding of the interaction between the municipal groundwater aquifers and the local surface water
features. Drilling is not being undertaken as part of the Phase 1 portion of the study; however, should
additional funds become available, additional boreholes may be drilled to fill data or knowledge gaps in
the conceptual understanding of the subsurface groundwater flow system. A water level snapshot is also
planned to take place as part of the study, and it aims to collect representative water levels for use in
calibrating the FEFLOW groundwater flow model.
It is estimated that the Phase 1 work will be completed in June 2009 and will be useful for inclusion within
the Source Protection Region’s Assessment Report. Phase 2 will commence following the Phase 1 study.

         6.7.6   City of Guelph Tier 3 Water Budget Assessment
Similar to the Region of Waterloo, the City of Guelph is also currently undertaking a Tier 3 Water Quantity
Risk Assessment as it was also designated in the GRCA Tier 2 Water Budget Study as having a
moderate to significant potential for hydrologic stress. Again, the objective of the Tier 3 Assessment is to
evaluate the sustainability of the water supply system for the City and identify potential threats to the long
term municipal water supplies. The Assessment will be centered on the development and refinement of
the Water Budget in the City of Guelph and beyond, using refined and updated numerical modelling tools,
which include a continuous GAWSER surface water model, and finite element FEFLOW groundwater
model.
The Assessment will aim to refine the understanding of the groundwater and surface water flow systems
within the study area, and improve the estimates of the various Water Budget components. As the
majority of the municipal wells are completed in the bedrock, field work was focussed on collecting
information to improve the understanding of the fractured bedrock environment in the Study Area. Several
boreholes will be drilled within the Study Area (Figure 6.7.1) as part of this Assessment, including 2 wells
within or near the Paris- Galt Moraine. All of the wells will be rotary drilled through the overburden, to the
top of bedrock, and then will be continuously cored through the bedrock. The bedrock portion of the wells
will be geophysically logged, and flute conductivity profiling will also be conducted within the bedrock.
Multi-level monitoring wells will be installed in the wells (shallow overburden, shallow bedrock and deep
bedrock), and water quality samples will also be collected and analyzed.
Although the Paris and Galt Moraines lie within the study area, the moraines are not being studied in any
greater detail than any other geologic or physiographic features located within the study area.

7.0       Knowledge/ Data Understanding and Issues
7.1    COMMENTS ON THE KNOWLEDGE REQUIREMENTS FOR POLICY DEVELOPMENT
The following section provides a “high level” discussion of the knowledge/data needs as they relate to the
technical decision-making process. It is not meant to be a detailed discussion on specific methodologies
for characterization, impact assessment or a decision making process framework. That discussion is
beyond the scope of this review as it would be of a scale similar to MOE documents prepared as Draft
Guidance Modules for Source Protection (e.g. Module 1: Watershed Characterization, MOE, 2006;
Module 7: Water Budget and Water Quantity Risk Assessment, MOE, 2007).
Within the context of this discussion, the following defines data and knowledge, using the groundwater
system as an example:
Data
These represent the basic spatial and temporal quantification of parameters that are input into:
     •   physical models;
     •   computer models; and,
     •   assessment and decision making models.
Examples of groundwater and related geological data include:
     •   groundwater levels and chemistry;
     •   porosity, hydraulic conductivity and groundwater velocity;
     •   geological logs and field observations;
     •   stream flow measurements; and,
     •   topography and overburden thickness.
Knowledge
The types of data, as described above, can be utilized to develop conceptual geologic and
hydrostratigraphic models. A physical characterization or interpretation of the groundwater system can
then be made. The understanding can be expanded or refined by assigning spatially and temporally
variable characteristic data (e.g. recharge, hydraulic conductivity of hydrostratigraphic units) for input into
analytical or numerical models. Computer models are the most commonly used tool in interpreting or
characterizing groundwater flow systems. This interpretation or characterization is considered basic
knowledge and when calibrated with field data provides two-dimensional and three-dimensional
representations and temporal trends of:
     •   groundwater recharge and discharge quantities;
     •   groundwater flow direction and velocity; and,
     •   contaminant transport.

 REVIEW OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE FOR THE WATERLOO AND PARIS/ GALT
MORAINES
This characterization is the basic technical knowledge used for decision making. The level of detail of
knowledge necessary for decision making can depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:
     •   the complexity of the geologic and hydrogeologic system;
     •   the sensitivity of the hydrogeologic system to changes in:
              o   recharge quantity and quality;
              o   groundwater withdrawal;
              o   physical change to the hydrogeologic media (excavation, deposition, infrastructure);
     •   the potential impacts related to specific land use activities; and,
     •   the sensitivity of the functional linkage of groundwater to its receptors (i.e. spawning areas,
         sensitive wetlands, water supply wells).
A similar approach can be used to assess the entire hydrologic system, with the coupling of groundwater
and surface water data, using all the components of a water budget for the hydrologic system and
characterizing the connections and the pathways of water movement through a system such as a
watershed.
         7.1.1    Requirements Based on Scale and Complexity
Hydrological and ecological processes function on a variety of spatial and temporal scales. As outlined in
Section 2.2.2, groundwater flow systems can be assessed on a variety of scales, ranging from a regional
scale (10 – 100’s of km) to a local scale (10 – 100’s of m). A technically sound characterization should
take this into account, both in terms of the spatial (3-dimensional) area of assessment and the amount of
time-dependent data (temporal scale) required to appropriately characterize these processes.
A study completed to examine the impact of a residential development on a nearby wetland is an
example of a local scale assessment, while a study of the regional groundwater flow from the Oak Ridges
Moraine into Lake Ontario would be classified as a regional assessment. In the case of the local study,
the regional groundwater flow picture may be overlooked as it may not be needed to answer questions
regarding the local groundwater-surface water interaction at the wetland. Similarly, the intricacies of the
local scale groundwater flow systems would be largely disregarded in the regional scale assessments.
In many areas of southern Ontario, hydrogeological assessments have been completed on the various
scales outlined above. Most often, regional scale studies have been completed using provincial or
municipal level funding (i.e. MOE funded Groundwater Management Studies or multi-stakeholder
watershed studies). Local scale studies primarily arise in response to questions regarding proposed land
use changes, such as a new landfill, aggregate operation, etc. Compiling the available monitoring
information or interpretations that are relevant to the study being conducted involves examining the bigger
picture (regional scale assessments), and using information and interpretations made in the local scale
studies.
In some instances, local studies may not have been undertaken or there may be limited data available,
resulting in knowledge or data gaps that place limitations on the physical interpretation within a given
area. Knowledge gaps primarily relate to areas where the understanding of the geology or hydrogeology
of an area is insufficient to make a refined interpretation with a sufficient degree of confidence. Additional
data is required. As discussed above, data gaps are commonly addressed by collecting field data such

MORAINES
as water levels, water chemistry data, or drilling boreholes and knowledge gaps are addressed by
carrying out the characterization and assessment.
A technically based process would typically incorporate a “top down” approach. Studies would be carried
out on a watershed scale utilizing the most data in a resource effective fashion. This may include using
representative site-specific data (i.e. one or two data points from a detailed local study) to provide a
characterization at a watershed scale. The characterization and assessment at this scale would
determine:
     •   hydrogeologically sensitive areas;
     •   areas with urban development pressure;
     •   areas already being impacted by land use activities; and,
     •   areas with a lack of data/knowledge;
An assessment of these factors would prioritize areas for characterization in more detail, generally at the
subwatershed scale. The process continues down through the “block plan” scale to the “site-specific”
scale, with general planning and assessment being carried out in correlation with these studies. It is
important to note that these studies are not solely based on hydrogeologic characterization. The
interdependent functions with other hydrological, aquatic and terrestrial components need to be
characterized and assessed.
From a scalar aspect, it is generally recommended that site-specific studies (i.e. gravel pit, landfill sites,
subdivision etc) utilize an investigative methodology that uses as its foundation the larger scale studies
and refines them on a local scale with site-specific data collection. The hydrogeologic complexity and
sensitivity will usually determine whether there is a gap between the site-specific study and the larger
scale study. For example, in some cases more detail than that usually found in a watershed study may be
needed to put a site-specific study in the proper larger scale context. A subwatershed scale study with
more detailed data from field observations and report reviews may be the necessary foundation if the
hydrogeologic setting is more sensitive and complex.
There will always be some level of data gaps, given the spatial and temporal variability of hydrogeologic
and ecosystem settings. This is an inherent factor, given the resources necessary to collect data. The
issue is whether the amount of data available provides an appropriate level of understanding, which is
usually determined through sensitivity analysis or risk assessment. In some cases there may be what are
considered “data gaps” (i.e. geological data to fill in interpreted hydrostratigraphy) but the level of
knowledge (i.e. knowing that certain parts of a system are hydraulically connected through pump tests
etc. without a detailed stratigraphy) of the groundwater flow system may be sufficient.
For example, if it is established that a recharge area exists, and there are no proposed changes to land
use (e.g. urban or industrial development) or land use activities (e.g. changes to agricultural practices)
proposed in the recharge area, then there will be no change in quantity of recharge. So without having
additional information, the quantity of water in the recharge area is protected. While there may be data
gaps in fully understanding the recharge area and its connection to water supply wells or wetlands it is not
necessary to understand these connections. In effect, there are no knowledge gaps to provide this broad
level of protection. It is noted however that this may not be the case for water quality, especially in areas
where broad non-point source impacts can occur (e.g. agricultural loadings, road salting). More detailed
assessment may be required even though there has been no change in land use.
If however, a broad area has been established as a recharge area and certain types of development can
occur in areas where it can be shown to have no impact on local wetlands or be outside the capture zone

MORAINES
of a nearby well field etc., then there are a number of knowledge gaps that have to be satisfied through
appropriate studies that would be set through policies.
From the perspective of policy development there needs to be a sufficient characterization of a specific
area, and an understanding of the hydrologic functions within this area, to assess the level of sensitivity
with respect to an existing land use or proposed land use change.
Policies are required to ensure:
     •   There is a sufficient understanding of the science (i.e. geology, groundwater flow, recharge areas,
         cold water fisheries) at whatever scale (e.g. watershed) being studied, to make decisions at that
         scale to ensure a broad level of protection.
     •   As the scale is refined (e.g. subcatchment area) the appropriate level of investigation is carried
         out to assess any potential impacts from proposed land use changes and provide appropriate
         protection (i.e. address the knowledge gaps that exist, moving down from the broader scale to the
         smaller scale).
     •   Appropriate monitoring is in place and there is a feedback loop (e.g. adaptive management plan)
         to ensure that everything is working as predicted, and if not, appropriate mitigation measures can
         be implemented.
     •   Appropriate monitoring and assessment is done far enough in advance to provide a technically
         sound characterization (i.e. basic functions and natural trends) to be incorporated into the
         planning process.
         7.1.2    Technical Requirements for Policy Development
Given the complexities of the preceding discussion we generally feel that the major components of the
technical process are in place and that the various agencies have applied considerable time and
resources to apply the “top down” approach. However, there appear to be some shortcomings in the
timing and chronology of the technical studies within the planning process. These may be of greater
importance within more complex hydrogeologic/hydrologic settings such as the Waterloo and Paris/ Galt
Moraines where the topography, thickness of and nature of overburden, and hummocky surface provides
for a greater potential for increased recharge, storage and ecological linkages. Examples of potential
shortcomings could include the following:
     •   Technical studies characterizing the geologic and hydrogeologic system must be done at an
         appropriate scale (i.e. subwatershed minimum) and over an appropriate length of time (e.g. 2+
         years) to obtain a technically sound database for assessment, prior to implementing broad-scale
         planning decisions within the study area.
     •   More detailed studies at a smaller scale should be carried out prior to block plan design.
     •   Follow-up monitoring and review of monitoring data is necessary to confirm performance of land
         use design and related BMPs. This would provide for mitigation or revised design of future land
         use changes, where necessary (i.e. develop an appropriate AMP through a feed back loop with
         appropriate monitoring).
     •   Long-term monitoring in developed and undeveloped areas in different hydrologic sensitivities is
         necessary to assess climatic trends.
A significant component of the knowledge base includes all the historic and ongoing initiatives and
programs dealing with technical issues and processes. These can include:
February 2009                                  FINAL REPORT                                                 69
 REVIEW OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE FOR THE WATERLOO AND PARIS/ GALT
MORAINES
     •    Technical assessments at all levels of government, related to basic research, assessment
          framework development, technical guidance documents.
     •    Academic research and review.
     •    Other stakeholder initiatives into technical research, assessment and guidance (i.e. industry,
          commercial, environmental groups).
Providing input and obtaining results from these studies is needed, to be cost and resource effective,
given there is usually significant overlap in the issues and objectives of the studies. This can be extended
to all the basic groundwater characterization studies which are being, or have been carried out and the
data that exists within the various agencies (i.e. groundwater databases, aquatic, terrestrial and
geological data). These data should be readily accessible for minimal cost and with minimal time delay to
carry out relevant technical assessments needed to satisfy current policy and regulations.
7.2     GENERAL SCIENCE ISSUES
Previous discussions have raised issues which give rise to challenges in providing a confident
characterization of the hydrogeologic system including; complex hydrostratigraphy, appropriate spatial
and temporal scale and subsequent adequate monitoring. Another challenging aspect, regardless of the
hydrogeological setting, is the inherent limitations of the science, both the physical understanding and the
methodology for assessment. The following is presented in the Water Budget and Water Quantity Risk
Assessment – Guidance Module 7; Appendix A - Water Budget Essentials (MOE, 2007):
“The interaction of the processes affecting the various components of the hydrologic cycle is complex and
often non-linear. For example, it is difficult to measure evapotranspiration, even though it is often the
largest fluctuating variable. Estimating groundwater recharge, often done as a residual, is a complicated
process that has a high potential for error (Lerner et. al., 1990). Given the error inherent in these
parameters, the team should compare, calibrate, and incorporate multiple estimation methods into the
water budget calculations. Most importantly, the team must always keep in the forefront that the complex
water budget estimates carry varying levels of uncertainty. This level of uncertainty can be reduced by
having better monitoring data to support more refined levels of model calibration.”
This highlights a number of aspects:
     •    the parameters of evapotranspiration, (ET), and recharge are difficult to measure;
     •     there are multiple methodologies and the methodologies themselves have inherent error; and,
     •    the uncertainty is minimized with more comprehensive monitoring data.
In addition to the limitations for quantifying ET and recharge other examples with the same general
limitations include:
     •    quantifying groundwater discharge both reach-specific (spot baseflow) and basin wide;
     •    determining and quantifying the spatial variability of hydrostratigraphic parameters (i.e. hydraulic
          conductivity); and,
     •    quantifying flow in fractured rock.
Although these types of limitations appear to challenge obtaining a confident understanding, the use of
robust numerical models with an appropriate level of monitoring data to calibrate the models provides a
high level of confidence. The modelling methodology also incorporates the following for more accuracy:
February 2009                                    FINAL REPORT                                                70
 REVIEW OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE FOR THE WATERLOO AND PARIS/ GALT
MORAINES
     •   a sensitivity analysis on each of the hydraulic parameters, to determine the most sensitive
         parameters and refine data collection and/or monitoring programs accordingly;
     •   follow-up monitoring on predicted impacts, to validate or refine the model; and,
     •   on-going incorporation of state-of-the-art research.
Aside from the relationship of these abiotic limitations specifically related to groundwater the limitations in
quantifying the aquatic and terrestrial communities comes into play when considering ecosystem impacts.
The limitations are not just confined to the component specific methodologies (i.e. quantifying fish
populations) but the complex interdependence of the abiotic and biotic systems. For example the
hydrogeologic community may be able to quantify modifications to the groundwater discharge to a stream
due to a land use change but the subsequent impact to fish populations is not an exact science. The
quantification of an ecological reserve of water is a major issue for the scientific community as
well as resource managers. Any follow-up monitoring to assess the impact would have to include all
the other abiotic and biotic factors affecting fish populations. This also raises the issue of scale as the
biotic scale for assessment may not coincide with the groundwater scale, both spatially and temporally.
Another issue, with respect to impact assessment, is the concept of cumulative effects. Cumulative
effects, as related to groundwater and functional linkages, would encompass the overall change to a
larger scale groundwater flow system due to smaller changes on a local scale. Aside from the combined
impacts on groundwater quantity for anthropogenic use, the functional linkage and potential impacts on
the ecosystem can also be significant. When considering ecosystem aspects, the following abstract from
Sidle, 1991 provides context:
“The concept of cumulative effects encompasses a broader spectrum of resources and land uses than has
typically been evaluated in research. As management pressures in large drainage basins intensify, pristine
areas may be subjected to multiple human activities. These activities are distributed through time and
space, and their effects can occur at the location of a particular land use or away from the location.
Even though individual land uses my not significantly degrade environmental components such as soil
productivity, water quality, or aquatic habitat, the combined effects of several activities may be
unacceptable. Theoretically, cumulative effects of land management may also provide benefits to
portions of ecosystems, such as increased stream productivity generated by nutrient inputs. Cumulative
effects of land management must also be evaluated within the context of natural processes and events,
such as large storms, wildfire, geochemical weathering, and vegetation succession.”
This again focuses on the importance of the following, related to characterization and protection:
     •   the interdependence of biotic and abiotic ecosystem components (i.e. not solely groundwater
         specific);
     •   the temporal and spatial scale relating to assessment and protection (not solely moraine specific);
         and,
     •   the extent of monitoring.
7.3     SUMMARY OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE WATERLOO MORAINE
Prior to providing specific comments or discussing the state of data/knowledge related to the Waterloo
Moraine the following general comments are presented:
     •   The Waterloo Moraine has provided much of the water supply to cities of Kitchener and Waterloo
         for over a hundred years resulting in an accumulation of a considerable volume of information.
February 2009                                   FINAL REPORT                                                  71
 REVIEW OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE FOR THE WATERLOO AND PARIS/ GALT
MORAINES
     •   The Waterloo Moraine is located in one major watershed, the Grand River watershed, and drains
         towards one regional lake basin.
     •   It is located almost entirely within a single Tier 1 municipality, the Region of Waterloo. The Region
         manages the entire regional municipal water supply system and has responsibility over existing
         municipal water supply wells, assessment of new water supplies and monitoring programs, with
         respect to permitted municipal water taking within the Waterloo Moraine.
     •   Research level studies have been conducted throughout the Waterloo Moraine for about 35
         years, including water resource assessment, hydrogeology investigations, Quaternary geology
         studies and ecological assessments.
     •   Groundwater contamination problems almost 20 years ago, at a well field outside of the Waterloo
         Moraine, resulted in the Region of Waterloo being one of the first municipalities in the country to
         develop a water resources protection strategy. An increased the level of study and understanding
         of the hydrogeology throughout the Region and in particular in the Waterloo Moraine. This
         protection strategy has recently been updated (2008).
     •   The Region of Waterloo has the most comprehensive data set of subsurface information
         anywhere in the province.
     •   Requirements of watershed studies and subwatershed studies in areas of existing and future
         development has provided a refined level of understanding of local water-related ecological
         features.
     •   There has been, and continues to be, on-going collaborative research of the Waterloo Moraine
         with the Region of Waterloo, the University of Waterloo, the OGS, the GSC and the GRCA.
     •   There is currently a Tier 3 Water Budget and Water Quantity Risk Assessment, being conducted
         on a subwatershed grouped basis, within the general area of the Waterloo Moraine and includes
         most of the major municipal well fields in the Region of Waterloo.
The following sections summarize our interpretation of the current state of knowledge of the Waterloo
Moraine. The discussion is divided into the general headings previously used Section 5 and described in
the general objectives of this study.
         7.3.1     Waterloo Moraine Boundary
One of the objectives of the current hydrogeology review was to examine boundary issues associated
with the Waterloo Moraine. This review was not meant to investigate all the interpretations and provide
our own interpretation, but rather examine the interpretations and the possible implications of differing
interpretations, with respect to protection of water-related features within the Waterloo Moraine.
Comments on the State of Knowledge
     •   It is recognized that the history of deposition and the depositional environment of features such
         as moraines make it difficult to draw a definitive boundary, outlining such features on a map.
     •   Previously interpreted boundaries of the Waterloo Moraine, as discussed in Section 5.2, are not
         substantially different. The variations are related to the use of mapped boundaries that included
         hummocky terrain and ice-contact sand, and the inclusions of some of the fringe areas that have
         been mapped as part of the Macton Moraine, found west of the Waterloo Moraine, but were
         considered part of the Waterloo Moraine on some mapping.
February 2009                                    FINAL REPORT                                               72
 REVIEW OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE FOR THE WATERLOO AND PARIS/ GALT
MORAINES
    •   The Region has chosen a combination of the two approaches; mapped hummocky terrain areas,
        and areas classified by Karrow, 1993 as the Waterloo Moraine, within these hummocky areas.
        The areas of the Waterloo Moraine that are not included within the Region’s boundary are
        primarily hummocky areas that Karrow has interpreted as the Macton Moraine, found to the west
        of the Waterloo Moraine.
    •   The areas not included in the Region’s mapped boundary are primarily on the fringe of the
        western or north western boundary of the Waterloo Moraine, away from any development
        pressure. The surficial geology of these areas is mapped as silty clay till. These areas provide
        limited recharge capability and would be interpreted as having a low sensitivity or importance to
        the overall function of the moraine.
    •   Recent investigations by the OGS have presented the possibility that the Waterloo Moraine may
        extend farther south than previously interpreted. Much of the area that the OGS is interpreting as
        potentially being part of the Waterloo Moraine is mapped as kame and outwash sands or gravels;
        and is interpreted as potentially providing substantial recharge. The moraine within this area is
        interpreted to be partially buried by younger, high permeability Grand River outwash deposits.
Comments on Data or Knowledge Gaps
    •   As a general comment, defining the actual “boundary” of a moraine would be considered a
        knowledge gap, if specific measures were to be developed to protect an entire moraine landform.
        There does not appear to be a consistent methodology that can be used to determine the
        boundary of a moraine. This was evident in the development of the Oak Ridges Moraine
        Conservation Plan (ORMCP), where it took years to determine the “boundary” of the moraine that
        would fall under the ORMCP. Eventually a specified topographic elevation was chosen, which
        was not based on the geological interpretation of distribution of the Oak Ridges Moraine
        sediments.
    •   Although the exact interpretation of the Waterloo Moraine boundary could be considered a data
        gap, it is not interpreted as a knowledge gap given the limited significance, from a recharge
        perspective, of the areas potentially in dispute. Any ecological features associated with these
        areas, primarily along the western boundary of the Waterloo Moraine, do not appear to be directly
        linked to the areas of significant hydrologic functions within the Waterloo Moraine.
    •   The area where the OGS is potentially extending their interpretation of the Waterloo Moraine
        could be considered a knowledge gap. However, most if not all of this area is part of the Region’s
        Environmentally Sensitive Landscape (ESL). It is intention of this designation to protect natural
        heritage, ecological features and water-related hydrologic features and functions within this area.
Conclusions
    •   It is not necessary to determine the “boundary” of the Waterloo Moraine, related to groundwater
        protection or the protection of hydrologic functions. Although there may be areas of the Waterloo
        Moraine that provide important hydrologic functions, any functionally significant features should
        already be known or will be further refined through additional studies independent of the moraine
        boundary.
    •   It is our interpretation that the boundary of the Waterloo Moraine is not considered an issue, with
        respect to the protection of hydrologic functions, as the areas where there are varying boundary
        interpretations appear to have limited water-related functions. If ecological features do exist in
        these areas, these features will be subject to existing Regional and Provincial policies. Where
        the OGS has identified the possibility that there could be a re-interpretation of the extent of the

MORAINES
          Waterloo Moraine to the south, it is noted that this area is currently protected through the
          Region’s ESL policy, with respect to ecological and water-related functions.
          7.3.2     Geology and Hydrogeology
The geology and hydrogeology of the Waterloo Moraine has been investigated at varying scales and with
various investigative techniques since the mid-1970s. There have been two approaches to attempt to
refine the understanding of the Waterloo Moraine: a) from a water resources and groundwater flow
perspective; and b), from a Quaternary geology perspective. Since the early 1990’s, these two
approaches have been combined to try to provide a more definitive interpretation of the physical features
of the Waterloo Moraine. With the advent of source water protection in the Province of Ontario over the
last five years more extensive investigations have been conducted through partnerships with the Ontario
Geological Survey (OGS), the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC), the Region of Waterloo and the
University of Waterloo and the Grand River Conservation Authority. The following summarizes our
current understanding of the state of knowledge of the geology and hydrogeology of the Waterloo
Moraine.
Comments on the State of Knowledge
     •    The Waterloo Moraine is a complex geologic structure and the general area defined as the
          Waterloo Moraine has been interpreted to consist of three major aquifers and a number of low
          hydraulic conductivity till units separating the aquifers. Conceptual hydrostratigraphic and
          hydrogeologic models have been developed for the Waterloo Moraine area and continue to be
          refined with new data, data mining techniques and analysis tools.
     •    The Region of Waterloo has the most comprehensive set of subsurface information in the
          province.
     •    The connection between the well fields, aquifer systems and Quaternary stratigraphy is generally
          understood on a broad-scale. The internal structure is not fully understood at a local or detailed
          scale, but research is ongoing.
     •    A three-dimensional model of Quaternary deposits in the Region of Waterloo has been recently
          developed by the OGS. There is the potential for updates and reinterpretations of the subsurface
          geology using new Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), recent borehole information and the latest
          upgrades to the Aquifer Mapping System utilized by the OGS.
     •    Three-dimensional groundwater flow models have been developed and continue to be refined as
          new data become available or as new geological interpretations are developed. Refinements to
          the hydrogeological interpretation are currently being conducted for much of the area of the
          Waterloo Moraine, as part of a Tier 3 Water Budget and Water Quantity Risk Assessment by the
          Region of Waterloo.
     •    In well fields where there have been groundwater contamination issues, extensive studies have
          been conducted to determine the source and pathway of contaminant migration in the
          groundwater system.
Comments on Data or Knowledge Gaps
     •    In a complex geologic setting such as the Waterloo Moraine, the understanding of the geology
          and hydrogeology can always be refined. There is presently a good understanding of the broad
          interpretation of the geology and hydrogeology of the Waterloo Moraine. Refinements to the

MORAINES
         geologic and hydrogeologic models will continue as new information becomes available and new
         analysis tools are developed.
Conclusions
     •   There is a sufficient understanding of the geology and hydrostratigraphy of the Waterloo Moraine.
         Although there are areas where data gaps exist and knowledge of the Waterloo Moraine can be
         further refined, it is concluded that the intent of the existing policies and current approach to
         technical studies are sufficient to refine the knowledge and understanding of the Waterloo
         Moraine.
         7.3.3     Functions of the Waterloo Moraine
The Waterloo Moraine is an important feature within Region of Waterloo and the Grand River watershed
as it provides substantial volumes of water to maintain water supplies within the Region and provides
water to maintain wetlands and baseflow to numerous creeks originating on the moraine. It also provides
more regional baseflow through discharge to the Grand River. The following summarizes the state of
knowledge of the functions of the Waterloo Moraine.
Recharge and Storage
Comments on the State of Knowledge
     •   The main recharge area to the municipal well fields within the Waterloo Moraine area has been
         identified and designated by the Region of Waterloo as a major recharge area.
     •   Much of the main recharge area is outside the existing and future designated urban areas of
         Kitchener and Waterloo.
     •   The recharge rates have been generally quantified through an integrated surface water and
         groundwater flow model. The GRCA has conducted extensive hydrological response modelling
         (GAWSER) of the Grand River watershed using surficial geology, and detailed Digital Elevation
         Models (DEMs), to determine local closed depressions and slopes. High recharge rates were
         predicted for much of the western portion of the Waterloo Moraine, as high as 500 mm in some
         areas. The high recharge area generally correlates with the Region’s designated recharge area.
     •   The core area of the Waterloo Moraine contains an extensive thickness of sand and gravel, both
         above and below the water table. The large unsaturated zone creates the ability to store large
         quantities of water, beyond the recharge capacity of the natural infiltration. The Region of
         Waterloo is currently utilizing a portion of the unsaturated zone for aquifer storage and recovery
         (ASR), by storing treated river water for re-use later as part of the municipal water supply.
Comments on Data or Knowledge Gaps
     •   The major recharge area within the Waterloo Moraine has been defined but there is the potential
         for local areas of significant recharge to exist, which may not be part of the major recharge area
         supplying water to the Regional municipal well fields. There could be local “windows” in low
         permeability geologic units that allow greater recharge at some locations. Recharge areas that
         supply water-related ecological features are not specifically defined or mapped at a Regional
         scale. This is typically done at a local watershed or subwatershed scale study.
     •   The GAWSER modelling has elements of uncertainty based on the scale and accuracy of
         characterization of such things as surficial soils, local topography and local stream flow estimates.

 REVIEW OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE FOR THE WATERLOO AND PARIS/ GALT
MORAINES
        The integrated modelling does allow for a “reasonableness” check on some of the water balance
        parameters but this is again a function of scale. These types of errors are inherent in all recharge
        assessments.
Conclusions
    •   The main recharge area within the Waterloo Moraine, which provides water to most of well fields
        within the Waterloo Moraine, is reasonably well mapped.
    •   Additional recharge areas, providing water to water-related ecological features and baseflow to
        the Grand River, are not specifically protected through the Region’s Water Resources Protection
        Strategy. However, other current policies (e.g. PPS, 2005), if implemented properly, should
        provide adequate protection for these recharge areas through an appropriate assessment of the
        understanding and protection of sensitive water-related features. Guidance on the implementation
        of the PPS, related to the protection of sensitive water-related ecological features, would assist in
        developing a consistent approach to the interpretation of the PPS. It is noted that this is beyond
        the scope of this work but would in any landscape. Appropriate scale investigations, conducted
        at an appropriate time in the planning process (e.g. the subwatershed planning stage and
        refinement beyond the subwatershed level), is important for the protection of sensitive water-
        related features.
Water Supply
The Waterloo Moraine aquifer system provides the majority of the water supply to the cities of Kitchener
and Waterloo through the Region of Waterloo’s integrated urban system (IUS) of water supply. Currently
there are 10 well fields in operation within the area of the Waterloo Moraine. Seven of the well fields are
located within the urban areas of Kitchener and Waterloo, while the other three well fields are located in
the core of the Waterloo Moraine, west of the urban areas. Water supply wells within the area of the
Waterloo Moraine also supply private wells and towns and villages in the western portion of the Region of
Waterloo.
Comments on the State of Knowledge
    •   As part of the Region of Waterloo’s Water Supply Strategy Update (RMOW, 2007), present and
        short term future water supplies have been assessed. For each of the municipal water supplies
        three values are assigned: maximum source capacity, maximum summer sustainable capacity
        and short term peaking capacity. All well fields within the area of the Waterloo Moraine have
        been assessed.
    •   New short term future water supplies (next five years) are currently being assessed within the IUS
        area, including three areas within the Waterloo Moraine.
    •   Capture zones have been developed for all wells or well fields within the area of the Waterloo
        Moraine.
    •   An extensive water monitoring program (groundwater and surface water) is conducted, both
        within the local area of each well field and more broadly across the Waterloo Moraine, to ensure
        that hydrologic-related impacts are minimized as a result of water taking.
Comments on Data or Knowledge Gaps
    •   The extent of additional water that could be taken from the Waterloo Moraine aquifer system is
        generally well defined. There is the potential for new sources or additional water taking from
        existing sources within the Waterloo Moraine and these are currently being explored as part of a
        Regional IUS optimization and expansion project.

 REVIEW OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE FOR THE WATERLOO AND PARIS/ GALT
MORAINES
    •   The majority of the Waterloo Moraine is within an area that is currently being assessed as part of
        a Tier 3 Water Budget and Water Quantity Risk Assessment. The study will refine the water
        budget and water quantity risk for the areas currently interpreted as being moderately stressed
        within the Region of Waterloo. This study is expected to be completed in 2010.
Conclusions
    •   Based on the state of knowledge of the water supply system, current legislation governing water
        taking and updated Regional policies (Water Resources Protection Master Plan, January, 2008) it
        is concluded that municipal water supply within the Waterloo Moraine is generally well-protected.
        However, a more complete assessment of water quantity is currently being conducted as part of a
        Tier 3 Water Budget Assessment.
Maintenance of Water Related Ecological Features
Comments on the State of Knowledge
    •   The Waterloo Moraine maintains many water-related ecological features, especially in the core
        area of the Moraine (i.e. the main recharge area).
    •   Over 70 Provincially Significant Wetlands (PSW’s) have been mapped within the boundary of the
        Waterloo Moraine. Most of the wetlands are located within or adjacent to the upper reaches of
        the Laurel Creek subwatershed. The direct linkage between groundwater and surface water is
        not fully defined throughout some of this area; however the hydrologic functions of the area are
        protected through the Region’s Environmentally Sensitive Landscape (ESL). Extensive studies
        have been carried out within the Laurel Creek subwatershed. The wetlands in the downgradient
        portion of the subwatershed are driven primarily by discharge but wetlands in the upper areas
        may be depressional features (i.e. hummocky terrain) collecting surface runoff, or they may be
        sustained by local groundwater discharge.
    •   The Strasburg Creek subwatershed also contains some PSW’s. The Waterloo Moraine provides
        water to these PSW’s. A subwatershed study has been conducted to refine the understanding of
        the hydrologic regime.
    •   Cold water fisheries and spawning areas have been mapped throughout the area of the Waterloo
        Moraine. The main recharge area provides baseflow to many coldwater streams whose
        headwaters originate in the main recharge area of the Waterloo Moraine, in particular Alder
        Creek, Hunsberger Creek, Bamberg Creek and Laurel Creek. Cold water fisheries have also
        been mapped along the eastern flank of the Moraine in Schneider Creek and Strasburg Creek.
        All of these creeks have been studied as part of subwatershed studies or water taking
        assessments, with the exception of Bamberg Creek, which is only partially in the Waterloo
        Moraine and is far removed from urban development pressure.
    •   Many of the water-related ecological features are located outside the urban area. There are
        several areas within the urban boundaries of Kitchener and Waterloo where water related
        ecological features exist. In these areas more detailed studies have been conducted or are
        ongoing (e.g. the lower portion of Laurel Creek, Schneider Creek and Strasburg Creek).
Comments on Data or Knowledge Gaps
    •   There appears to be a good understanding of the water-related ecological features in the
        Waterloo Moraine at a subwatershed scale. The local linkage between groundwater and the
        ecological features may not be well defined at a very local scale. There may be local knowledge
        gaps in site-specific areas, especially in southwest Kitchener, where development pressure is

MORAINES
        great and there may be data gaps due to timing of studies being conducted relative to the timing
        of potential land use changes. One of the key areas, the headwaters area of Laurel Creek, has
        many Provincially Significant Wetlands; however this area is now part of a larger area designated
        by the Region as an Environmentally Sensitive Landscape (ESL).
Conclusions
    •   There is generally sufficient information available to show where water-related ecological features
        exist. At a local scale the actual linkage between the groundwater and specific ecological
        features may not be fully defined and this is assessed through local subwatershed studies.
        Typically, through existing policies, additional site-specific environmental impact studies are
        required in these areas prior to development. There may be an issue in some areas, with respect
        to the timing of data collection and assessment of local site-specific features, relative to the
        development of conceptual land use designations and/or constraints.
        7.3.4    Water Quantity/ Water Budget
Comments on the State of Knowledge
    •   Current monitoring of water levels throughout the Waterloo Moraine has not shown an overall
        decline due to water taking over the last 15 years. Historical impacts from the initial pumping
        from the older well fields (prior to 1970) are not well documented, but suggest there may have
        been a local decline in water levels of 5 -10 m in some areas, during the early operation of some
        of the well fields.
    •   Monitoring of water levels during pumping and well field shutdowns have provided a reasonable
        understanding of capture areas, sustainability of individual well fields and potential stresses due
        to pumping, on a local scale.
    •   Water budget and water quantity risk assessments have been conducted for throughout the
        Grand River watershed as part of Source Protection studies. Results of the Tier 1 assessment
        indicated a potential area of stress in the Region of Waterloo, covering a larger subwatershed
        grouping in which the Waterloo Moraine is located.
    •   A more detailed water budget assessment was conducted as part of the Tier 2 Water Budget and
        Water Quantity Risk Assessment. The assessment further subdivided the Region into five
        subwatershed groupings, with the Waterloo Moraine primarily in two main groupings. One of the
        subwatershed groupings, which included the eastern portion of the Waterloo Moraine, showed
        the potential for a moderate level of stress in the Tier 2 study. A Tier 3 water budget and water
        quantity risk assessment is presently being carried out for this area.
Comments on Data or Knowledge Gaps
    •   The water budget and water quantity risk assessments are not “moraine-specific” but have been
        carried out on a broader watershed/subwatershed scale. This could be interpreted as a data gap
        however the broader scale studies have encompassed the Waterloo Moraine. Current Tier 3
        Water Budget Assessments are assessing areas with the Region that are considered stressed,
        from the findings of the Tier 2 study.

 REVIEW OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE FOR THE WATERLOO AND PARIS/ GALT
MORAINES
Conclusions
    •   There is a general understanding of water quantity and water budget within the Waterloo
        Moraine. A portion of the Waterloo Moraine has been identified as being moderately stressed.
        Detailed Tier 3 studies are underway to refine the water quantity assessment and water budget in
        areas of the Waterloo Moraine that have been identified as being under moderate stress. These
        studies will be completed in 2010.
        7.3.5     Water Quality
Comments on the State of Knowledge
    •   Water quality monitoring has been conducted at most well fields within the Waterloo Moraine for
        decades. The Region of Waterloo implemented a formal water quality monitoring program
        throughout the Region in the mid-1990s. A water quality monitoring program for monitoring wells
        within the capture area of the well fields and general areas outside the well fields has been in
        place since 1999.
    •   There has been an increase in sodium and chloride concentrations in a number of the urban well
        fields since the 1960s, as a result of decades of road salt application on roads, sidewalks and
        parking lots. Several wells within some of the older well fields (in particular the Greenbrook and
        William Street well fields) have sodium and chloride concentrations exceeding recommended
        drinking water guidelines. The sodium and chloride loading is likely a combination of broad scale
        migration of road salt impacted water moving downward through the regional aquifer-aquitard
        system and local migration through “windows” in some of the aquitard units
    •   Nitrate concentrations are elevated in several of the municipal wells in the Waterloo Moraine,
        located in the rural area west of Kitchener. This is a result of decades of nitrate loadings in
        agricultural areas. Water for these wells is obtained from “Aquifer 1” in these areas and there is
        limited natural protection of this aquifer at ground surface. Several of the local well fields
        supplying rural municipalities west of Kitchener and Waterloo also have elevated nitrate
        concentrations and some of the wells are currently not operational. There is a “stratification” of
        nitrate concentrations in the upper portion of Aquifer 1 in some areas. As a result, the rate of
        water taking in some wells is managed in order to minimize the increase in nitrate concentration
        at depth in the aquifer.
    •   Several well fields have experienced local site-specific industrial contamination as a result of
        historical industrial development and practices, in particular the Greenbrook well field and to a
        lesser extent the William Street well field. Although there appears to be considerable natural
        protection, it is likely that there are local “windows” in the aquitard units that have allowed the
        migration of contaminants to depth. The contaminant sources are from old industrial sites. These
        well fields also have the high sodium and chloride concentrations.
    •   As part of the Region’s source water protection program, the Region has developed well head
        protection areas, delineated vulnerable areas, and compiled a threats inventory database and a
        list of threats within well head protections areas. The Region has also developed a risk
        management program to rank potential risks and developed a risk reduction program within the
        wellhead protection areas.
Comments on Data or Knowledge Gaps
    •   There is a general understanding of the broader water quality issues. There are data gaps in
        understanding the distribution of contaminants in the groundwater, for both point source and non-

MORAINES
          point source contaminants. This is expected in any large-scale water quality monitoring program,
          where there are many potential sources of contamination from various land use activities.
     •    Numerous investigations have been conducted in areas of industrial contamination at local well
          fields; however in some cases an understanding of the contaminant source and distribution has
          not been fully determined. Studies are on-going in these areas.
     •    Pilot studies have been undertaken by the Region, including: nitrate reduction strategies within a
          well head protection area where nitrates are elevated; and, conducting road salt management
          and chloride reduction studies.
Conclusions
     •    There are data gaps, as would be expected in any water quality monitoring program at this scale.
          The data continues to be collected and refined as part of routine monitoring programs and site-
          specific investigations. Without a detailed assessment of all of the water quality data available it
          would be difficult to determine if more should be done, however this is beyond the scope of this
          report. The Region has implemented a number of new initiatives such as: the Rural Water
          Quality Program; land management and financial incentives in the area of a rural water supply
          well with elevated nitrates; a salt reduction program throughout the Region; and, prioritization of
          high risk threats within well head protection areas to reduce risks to water quality.
7.4     SUMMARY OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE PARIS/ GALT MORAINES
          7.4.1    Paris/ Galt Moraine Boundary
As with the Waterloo Moraine boundary one of the objectives of the study was to consider the limits of the
Paris and Galt Moraine. The Waterloo Moraine boundary has been discussed in some detail because of
its history. This review was not meant to investigate the current mapping provided by the MOE or to
provide our own interpretation, but rather examine the interpretations and the possible implications of
differing interpretations with respect to protection of water-related features within Paris/ Galt Moraine.
Comments on the State of the Knowledge
     •    The Paris and Galt Moraines have been historically assessed within a simple physiographic
          framework (i.e. Chapman and Putnam, 1984) without any significant concern for their exact
          boundaries. Within a hydrogeological context its associated hummocky nature and the sandy
          characteristic of the Wentworth Till has been dominant. Inclusions of permeable kame deposits
          are common.
     •    There was no documentation during the current review that expressed concern related to defining
          the boundary of either the Paris or Galt Moraine.
Comments on Data or Knowledge Gaps
     •    As a general comment, defining the actual boundary of a moraine would be considered a
          knowledge gap, if specific measures were to be developed to protect a moraine. There does not
          appear to be a consistent methodology that can be used to determine the boundary of a moraine.
          This was evident in the development of the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan (ORMCP),
          where it took years to determine the “boundary” of the moraine that would fall under the ORMCP.
     •    Some discussion has centred on the buried nature of these moraines, in some areas along their
          extent. This raises the question of the significant functionality of determining the extent of the

 REVIEW OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE FOR THE WATERLOO AND PARIS/ GALT
MORAINES
        buried moraine and whether any practical level of effort (i.e. drilling, geophysical mapping) could
        delineate a boundary.
Conclusions
    •   It is not considered necessary to determine the boundary of the Paris/ Galt Moraines, related to
        groundwater protection or the protection of hydrologic functions. Any functionally significant
        features should be known or determined independent of the moraine boundary when various
        studies are carried out.
        7.4.2     Geology and Hydrostratigraphy
Comments on the State of the Knowledge
    •   The general geology and stratigraphy are presented within the Quaternary geology reports.
        Watershed and subwatershed studies and more recent groundwater protection and source
        protection studies provide hydrostratigraphic interpretation and hydrostratigraphic cross-sections
        in limited geographical areas.
    •   Recent drilling by the OGS has refined the stratigraphic structure and interpretation in the
        Oakland/Glen Morris area.
Comments on Data or Knowledge Gaps
    •   The detailed geology and hydrostratigraphy of the Paris and Galt Moraines has not been
        extensively investigated. Again, detailed investigations have historically been conducted where
        land use changes or groundwater taking has already occurred. Detailed geologic investigations
        over the total extent of the Paris/ Galt Moraines have also not occurred.
    •   The complex nature of the internal and associated deposits makes it inherently difficult to quantify
        the stratigraphy given the amount of investigative drilling that would have to be carried out along
        the length of these moraines.
Conclusions
    •   A more detailed characterization of the geology and hydrostratigraphy should be carried out
        within and adjacent to areas being considered for future development (refer to Section 7.1.2).
        These more local characterization studies should take into account the larger scale interpretation
        and incorporate the new information into refining the larger scale characterization.
        7.4.3     Significant Functions of the Paris and Galt Moraines
Recharge and Storage
Comments on the State of the Knowledge
    •   The characterization of recharge along the length of the moraines system varies depending on
        the scale of the studies carried out. The watershed studies and Tier 2 source protection studies
        have characterized the level of recharge in some detail. The subwatershed studies in various
        areas, particularly northerly along the moraines from Cambridge through to the Caledon area
        usually provide a more detailed quantification of recharge particularly if spot baseflow
        measurements and surface water modelling are integrated.

 REVIEW OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE FOR THE WATERLOO AND PARIS/ GALT
MORAINES
    •   The storage aspect has been discussed within the context of private wells, specific capacities and
        the expected discontinuous nature of the permeable sand and gravel lenses within the core of the
        moraines. The storage aspect is limited for major supplies but may be significant for private water
        supplies and local groundwater discharge.
Comments on Data or Knowledge Gaps
    •   The amount of recharge which makes its way into the underlying bedrock aquifer(s) has not been
        quantified to any great extent.
    •   Recharge and storage has only been quantified to a limited extent, primarily in areas where more
        detailed subwatershed studies have been conducted.
Conclusions
    •   Recharge should be refined in areas where land use change is expected particularly where it may
        relate to local groundwater discharge.
Water Supply
Comments on the State of the Knowledge
    •   A basic understanding of private water supplies as it relates to potential aquifers is known.
    •   The general areas of capture for the major well fields are known and will be refined through the
        Tier 3 process.
    •   The Tier 3 process for the City of Guelph and Region of Waterloo will evaluate the sustainability
        of the water supply system(s) and identify potential water quantity threats to each of the municipal
        water supplies.
Comments on Data or Knowledge Gaps
    •   More significant aquifers may exist related to the Paris/ Galt Moraines. Some studies are
        currently being conducted by the OGS.
Conclusions
    •   An understanding of potential impacts from municipal water supplies and the potential impacts on
        municipal water supplies appears to be addressed, and where there are current stresses Tier 3
        Water Budget Assessments will further refine the understanding.
Maintenance of Ecological Features
Comments on the State of the Knowledge
    •   The general understanding of the groundwater function to the streams and wetlands is known.
        The level of detail of understanding increases where there have been subwatershed studies but
        detailed quantification at a smaller scale should be carried out prior to development. These
        subwatershed studies have been carried out within three of the areas of municipal groundwater
        development and within the urban boundaries of Cambridge and the City of Guelph.
Comments on Data or Knowledge Gaps
February 2009                                 FINAL REPORT                                                82
 REVIEW OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE FOR THE WATERLOO AND PARIS/ GALT
MORAINES
    •   The capture zones and recharge areas which supply water for the municipal water supplies may
        not coincide with the overall recharge areas which may be developed within the urban boundary
        and as such may not be looked at in detail in the Tier 3 studies.
    •   The assessment and maintenance of the ecological features would generally require an
        understanding the recharge, groundwater flow and discharge flow paths. The maintenance would
        usually be necessary if there were going to be land use changes or water resource development.
        If these are not occurring than the issue becomes “is a detailed understanding necessary?” (refer
        to comments in Section 7.1.2).
Conclusions
    •   The most significant issue is to characterize the linkages at an appropriate scale prior to planning
        (refer to Section 7.1.2).
    •   More widespread monitoring of groundwater levels and baseflow is necessary in areas of
        proposed future development, regardless of whether these areas are within either moraine
        footprint (refer to discussions in Sections 7.1.1 and 7.1.2).
        7.4.4    Water Quantity and Budget
Comments on the State of the Knowledge
    •   There is a lack of understanding of the localized extent of the permeable sand and gravel lenses
        within the Paris/ Galt Moraines as well as the distribution of potential older aquifer material that
        may underlie these moraines.
    •   The Paris/ Galt Moraines form the headwaters of the surface water divides. The moraine
        features are not specifically separated out during the water budget analysis except when
        providing estimates of recharge.
    •   More detailed data is limited to areas where more detailed subwatershed studies have been
        carried out.
    •   Limited groundwater monitoring along the moraine presents general water level trends which
        indicate seasonal variations but no significant long term changes.
    •   Monitoring in select areas of extensive gravel extraction does not indicate significant water level
        impacts.
Comments on Data or Knowledge Gaps
    •   Given the potentially complex and relatively discontinuous hydrostratigraphic nature of the Paris/
        Galt Moraines it would require extensive monitoring and assessment to determine the overall
        water quantity and water budget for the entire extent of the Paris/ Galt Moraines.
    •   More widespread monitoring of groundwater levels and baseflow is necessary in areas connected
        to proposed long term development but are not necessarily moraine specific (refer to Section
        7.1.2).
Conclusions
    •   More widespread monitoring of groundwater levels and baseflow is necessary in areas of
        proposed future development, regardless of whether these areas are within either moraine
        footprint (refer to discussion in Sections 7.1.1 and 7.1.2).

MORAINES
        7.4.5    Water Quality
Comments on the State of the Knowledge
    •   The general water quality understanding described in Section 6.6 presents a more qualitative
        description.
    •   Limited water quality data shows elevated nitrate and sodium levels in localized areas. These are
        attributed to agriculture, septic systems and road salting.
    •   Potential contaminant sources were documented for the City of Guelph, Puslinch Township and
        the Region of Waterloo.
Comments on Data or Knowledge Gaps
    •   Given the discontinuous nature of permeable units within the moraines and the lack of any
        widespread aquifer units the issue becomes determining the most appropriate locations to
        monitor for groundwater quality.
Preliminary Conclusions
    •   In the absence of any major land use changes or water resource demand along the rest of the
        Paris and Galt Moraines the technical need for water quality monitoring may be limited, but can
        be useful in characterizing the groundwater flow system for the functions described above.

Abstract
The Lake Ontario Collaborative used the event‐based modelling approach for the identifying
significant threats to Lake Ontario drinking water intakes in the study area (Coastal Zone of Lake
Ontario) between Halton and Niagara. Under this approach, the Source Protection Committee
(SPC) decides, based on local knowledge, what activities it wants evaluated through modelling,
to identify Threats from Activities in Intake Protection Zone 3 (IPZ3).
In this report, the various "spill scenarios" defined by the SPC, were examined to determine the
impact of the different spills on the water quality at the municipal water treatment plant intakes
along the north shore of Lake Ontario.
The spills were modelled with a calibrated three‐dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality
computer model. The MIKE‐3 software, based on the whole of Lake Ontario, was used in nested
mode to simulate the currents in the nearshore areas of interest for the Lake Ontario
Collaborative. An extensive set of trials were made to calibrate the model, both hydrodynamics
and advection‐dispersion, using observed currents from several different locations, and a
specific spill (a tritium spill). The vector variance of speed and direction or Fnorm value was
used as the measure of agreement between the model predictions and observed data, values as
low as 0.62 (zero is perfect match) were achieved over several months of simulation results.
Temperature serial correlations as high as 0.95 were achieved.
 Areas, modelled in fine detail, ranged along the Lake Ontario shoreline from the Halton Region,
City of Hamilton, Grimsby and St. Catharines. Spill scenarios addressed:
        Disinfection failures at the wastewater treatment plants ‐ high E.coli levels released
         through outfall/diffusers,
        Tritium releases at shoreline from Pickering and from the Darlington NGS diffuser,
        Oil pipeline breaks, transporting refined gasoline, with subsequent release of Benzene
         to tributaries of Lake Ontario
        Tank Farm releases of gasoline , with subsequent release of benzene to tributaries of
         Lake Ontario,
        Sanitary trunk sewer breaks, which release raw sewage to tributaries of Lake Ontario,
         causing impacts of E.coli and TSS,
        Tanker truck spill of gasoline and subsequent release of benzene to Lake Ontario,
The LOC determined that an activity poses a significant drinking water threat, “where the spill
has the potential to reach surface water intake(s) at a sufficient concentration to cause
deterioration in water quality (the impact)”. Criteria based on Drinking water standards and
other approaches were used as the threshold for determining deterioration. Peak concentration

1 Introduction and Model Description
1.1 Introduction
The Lake Ontario Collaborative used the event‐based modelling for the identification of
significant threats to Lake Ontario drinking water intakes in the study area. This approach and
the applicable guidance is further described on the Ministry of the Environment’s source water
protection website. Under this approach, the Source Protection Committee decides, based on
local knowledge, what activities it wants evaluated through modelling to identify Threats from
Activities in Intake Protection Zone 3.
The Lake Ontario Collaborative used an impact assessment method to determine if an activity
poses a significant drinking water threat by determining “whether a spill has the potential to
reach surface water intake(s) at a sufficient concentration to cause deterioration in water
quality (the impact)”.
This report describes the lake modelling performed to assess the impact of spill events on the
water intakes in the study area. The report evolved over the study period as spill scenarios were
developed and questions were asked as to "what ifs". This report was prepared to support the
analysis and questions posed by the Lake Ontario Collaborative.
The source of water for Lake Ontario based municipal drinking water intakes, is in this coastal
zone, which is defined as water depths of 30 m or less. With one exception, the intake pipes are
all located within this near‐shore zone (their intake crib is located at distances ranging from 0.5
– 5 kilometres off‐shore). But the focus of the modelling assessment provided in this report is
both the Coastal Zone and the main lake off shore waters.
 In a large lake system such as Lake Ontario, water quality and the sources and processes that
influence water quality are not the same for the near shore area (coastal zone) as compared to
that found further offshore (main lake area). In Lake Ontario the coastal zone is considered as
the area from the shoreline out to the 30 m depth contour. In the coastal zone, water quality is
influenced by land‐based discharges (such as rivers, streams, wastewater treatment plants, and
groundwater) which mixes at the boundary of the zone with the off‐shore main lake waters. The
rate at which this mixing of the coastal and main lake water occurs is subject to hydrodynamic
forces such as prevailing wind speed and direction, water and air temperatures and the
bathymetry. Other processes in the lake can cause taste and odour problems for example.
The quality of water in the main lake area is established largely by water flowing from the
upstream Great Lakes (Erie, Huron, Michigan, and Superior) through the Niagara River into Lake
Ontario and direct rainfall and atmospheric fallout to the lake’s surface together with
biochemical processes that occur within Lake Ontario.

                                      Report for Lake Ontario Collaborative Halton – Hamilton Focus
In carrying out this work, events were modelled based on large releases of contaminants
associated with existing activities on land that might result in deterioration of water quality to
the point that it is unsuitable for use as a source of drinking water. A number of spill scenarios
were modelled to determine if certain land‐based activities could pose a potential drinking
water threat to these intakes. Any scenario that identifies conditions under which a contaminant
could exceed a threshold in the raw water is identified as a significant drinking water threat. The
events that were modelled were: disinfection failures at each municipal waste water treatment
plant; accidental large scale release of tritiated water from nuclear power plants; product of
waste spills from industrial facilities; and spills from a petroleum pipeline as it crosses major
tributaries.
 In terms of governance of the Modelling work, the list of events was developed in consultation
with municipal staff responsible for water and wastewater, conservation authority staff, and
some industrial representatives, under the Leadership of Mr. Rodney Bouchard (Peel Region),
who acted as Project Manager for the Lake Ontario Collaborative.
1.2 Modelling Objectives and Selection
1.2.1 Modelling Objectives
The following points outline the objectives of the 3‐D hydrodynamic and water quality modelling
present herein:
             Develop a dynamic 3‐D hydrodynamic model that accurately simulates the currents
              and water temperature conditions along the north shore of Lake Ontario;
             Calibrate the model based on observed currents and temperature data;
             Calibrate the model advection‐transport module based on observed spill along the
              north shore of Lake Ontario;
             Calibrate the model to simulate the bacteria levels from stormwater, CSOs and
              tributaries;
             Use the calibrated model to assess impacts on the water quality at water treatment
              plant intakes from numerous spill scenarios;
             Establish a methodology for sampling the spectrum of lake conditions.
1.2.2 Model Selection
The modelling software selected for this application was the MIKE‐3 package developed by the
Danish Hydraulic Institute (DHI). MIKE‐3 is a professional engineering software package for 3‐D
free surface flows.

1.2.3 Mike 3 Model ‐ Non‐Technical Description
A whole lake model is required to predict the water currents in the nearshore area of interest,
say the Toronto Waterfront, or the lake offshore of the Town of Wellington. MIKE‐3 uses the
full three‐dimensional representation of water motion, including thermodynamics. It accurately
simulates the seasonal thermal conditions and summer stratification that affects the circulation
pattern in Lake Ontario, which is required for accurate predictions of water currents. The model
is based on a number of separate software modules which are invoked for various tasks such as
hydrodynamic simulation, advection‐dispersion of dissolved substances, particle tracking for oil‐
spills, ecological & biological processes. All advanced modules depend on the basic
hydrodynamic module which supplies the information about the lake currents and temperature.
1.2.4 Mike‐3 HD module
The Hydrodynamic (HD) module simulates the 3‐D incompressible Reynolds averaged Navier‐
Stokes equations with Boussinesq assumptions. The model is based on continuity of mass,
momentum, temperature, density and salinity equations, with a turbulence closure scheme.
The effects of source and sinks, river discharges, surface water elevations are included.
The temperature is affected by solar input through air temperature, relative humidity and sky
clearness.
1.2.5 Mike‐3 AD Module
The advection‐dispersion (AD) module is coupled with the HD module. Transport (advection) of
scalar quantities such as temperature, salinity and tracers is handled in the AD module.
Dispersion is the second purpose of this module – it covers the spreading, longitudinally,
laterally and vertically.
Tracers can be conservative or have a first order decay.
1.2.6 Lake Hydrodynamics and Heat Exchange
The major forcing function used to drive the currents in the model is wind stress.
The thermal stratification of Lake Ontario begins after the spring thaw. Water near the
shoreline warms up first and the zone of warmer water slowly spreads out as the heating from
the sun increases. Water temperatures start out at 4C and warm from there. The maximum
density of water occurs at 4C and is the major factor in the formation of the thermal
stratification. Cold water at 4C will sink below warmer water. Wind mixing of the upper water
column is only sufficient to keep the top 20 to 35 m or so well mixed during the summer period,
causing the water this depth to remain at 4C. There will be a structured thermal distribution in
the water column. Typically the water column would be 20C from the surface to say 20 m, over
the next 10‐m or so the temperature decreases non‐linearly to 4C and from 35 m downward
the water is a constant 4C. A thermal bar first forms in the spring and slowly extends out into
                                                     1‐3

the lake with the warm layer thinnest in the center of the lake and thickest at the shoreline –

Figure 1‐1           Lake Thermal Process
When the lake is stratified, wind stress affects the lake differently than when the lake is
isothermal as in the spring and fall. Upwelling and downwelling events occur during
stratification, which cause cold deep lake water to flow toward the north shore displacing
warmer water with clean fresh cold water, downwelling has the opposite effect. These events
are not predicted by two‐dimensional models which is why three dimensional models are used.
In order to cause warming and cooling of the water in the lake, a thermodynamic balance is
required. The heat balance is controlled by latent heat loss by thermal radiation to outer space
and evaporation and heat gain by solar radiation (long wave and short wave) and conduction
from surface air.
1.2.7 Meteorological Data
The MIKE‐3 HD module requires the surface wind speed and direction to drive the water
currents. Wind speed and direction time series at an hourly frequency were used to provide
the surface wind stress.
Additional parameters include air temperature, relative humidity and sky clearness. These data
are usually measured at major airports 24/7 on an hourly basis.

Atmosphere and Environmental Services (AES) also operate lake buoys that collect wind and
temperature related data. While this data would seem to be a natural source of the required
data, the model performance based on the data is very poor compared to the land‐based
Airport data.
Airport data from Toronto’s Pearson, Trenton, Kingston, Buffalo, Rochester and the weather
station at NWRI Burlington were tried in various simulations during the calibration process.
A new source was recently introduced – NOAA (National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
Administration) has produced a 5 km based 2‐D wind field based on the North American
Mesoscale Atmospheric Model. The hourly data is available for 2002 and onwards.

2 Model Calibration
2.1 Hydrodynamic Model Calibration
The Mike 3 model is based on a mathematical formulation known as the finite difference (FD)
method. The lake is represented by a grid of squares with vertical layers. The whole lake is
divided up into squares with edges 2430m long. Equal length vertical layers are used to
represent the water depth. The vertical distribution of depths is known as the Z‐coordinate
system. Other models use a FD grid with a constant distance between layers, such as the Sigma‐
coordinate system ‐ with variable layer thickness, and there are others based on variations of
this method. Still other models are based a triangular grid known as a Finite Mesh method and
can have either a Z, Sigma coordinate system or mixed.
The method MIKE‐3 uses for nesting ‐ in order to obtain fine scale resolution of study area ‐
consists of a whole lake model, in our case based on a resolution of 2430 m, and nested grids at
a ratio of 3:1, or 810, 270, 90 m respectively. The nested grids are computed simultaneously
along with the whole lake grid. This provides a top‐down, bottom‐up feedback system so that
fine details in the smaller grids can influence the larger grids calculations, and similarly large
scale motions are felt by the finer grids. Tributaries can be fed into the computations at any
scale of the nesting grids. For example the Niagara River flows into the large whole lake model,
and the water levels at Kingston are used to control the whole lake elevation. Smaller
tributaries or spill discharges are usually released into the smallest grid. Sometimes it is
necessary to use the outer nested grid to discharge tributaries that are remote to the study area
but may have an effect of the area, this helps to keep the simulation times short as larger fine
grids vastly increase computer times.
Other models do not have this flexibility ‐ POM, ELCOM, CANDIE, etc.. Their method would be
to run a whole lake model and then the velocities and temperature and other pertinent
variables would be stored along boundary lines that form the edges of a nested grid. Then the
nested grid would be run with the stored data providing the forcing at the boundaries of the
finer grid. The finer grid would "feel" the impact of the Niagara River, but it cannot feed back to
the whole lake model any influences it may have on the whole lake circulation. For example the
Toronto Inner Harbour, the East Headland, Humber Bay and other finer resolution shoreline
features would not be represented in a whole lake model, the headland and Toronto Islands
may be just a blip on the shoreline. The flows in and out of the eastern and western gaps would
not be felt by the whole lake mode. In the MIKE‐3 world all these features would be modelled
at each time step.
Another significant benefit of simultaneous nested grids is that a plume that moves beyond the
finest scale grid is still within the computational domain, it is still in the model! In a two mode
model, like POM, if a plume moves beyond the boundaries of the fine grid, it is lost. So a plume
that moves out the model domain, and then a current reversal occurs that would bring the

plume back into the fine grid, does not happen in the non‐ nested approach of models like
POM. The MIKE‐3 system can model plumes that move outside of even all 3 sub‐nests, into the
2430 m whole lake model, and then move back into the say 90 m grid, although there will be
some loss of definition when going from the coarse to fine grids.
A disadvantage of a nested grid model, run in a finite difference format, is the computation time
step ‐ the time step of the lake wide model is set by the grid size of the smallest mesh. In the
2430 m grid a time step of 600 seconds is possible, however when the nested grids are used the
time step has to decrease to about 30 seconds for a 90 m grid and 90 seconds for the 270 m
grid.
Boegman and Yerubandi, 2006, showed 2 km resolution was insufficient to resolve some of the
fine scale processes, topographic and Kelvin waves, for example, and that grids smaller than 1
km are required. For MIKE‐3 this will require increasing the number of grids by at least 4 times
for the whole lake model and consequently much smaller time steps which will require longer
simulation times. We are limited by computer resources and other time constraints at this time.
This is a compromise that must be considered in future spill modelling.
2.2     Calibration Parameters
The calibration process involves selecting the appropriate grid sizing, time step, vertical
resolution, wind source and other driving forces, and then adjusting the model parameters (fine
tuning) to make the model predictions agree with observed data. Normally current data
collected with instruments deployed in the lake are used to calibrate the hydrodynamic module.
Temperature data collected at water intakes are also valuable in this process.
2.3 Turbulence Models
MIKE‐3 has 6 optional turbulence models, but the user can select only one. They are:
        the very simple "no eddy viscosity"
        "constant eddy viscosity"
        Smagorinsky formulation
        κ model formulation
        κ‐ε model formulation
        highest order accuracy ‐ Mixed κ‐ε/Smagorinsky.
The simple models do not develop a thermal stratification, the Mixed κ‐ε/Smagorinsky was used
throughout all simulations as it is the highest order accuracy scheme and produces better
correlations with the observed data.

                                     Report for Lake Ontario Collaborative Halton – Hamilton Focus
2.4 Bathymetry
The bathymetry data was obtained from the NOAA Lake Ontario CD at a resolution of 3 arc
seconds (NOAA 1999). This grid was interpolated to a 90m resolution with the MIKE‐3
bathymetry editor. The whole lake resolution was selected as 2430m.
The whole lake model resolution of 2430m is too coarse to study the near‐shore dynamics of the
lake, so a method of nesting is used to provide currents and plume travel information in greater
detail.
2.5 Nested Grids
The Mike‐3 model uses a 3:1 nesting with smaller grids based on 810m, 270m, 90m, 30m and so
on. Most of the nested models used in the report, are based on a 270m and 90m grid. The
computational time increases with smaller grid sizes so it is important to economize grid layout.
2.6 Vertical Resolution
Just as important, to minimize computer time, is the choice of vertical resolution. Lake Ontario
is over 250m deep, with the thermocline extending down to about 60m at the time of fall over‐
turn; adequate representation is required of the upper 60m while the area below the
thermocline can be simulated as a single layer of water. This is one limitation of the Z‐
coordinate system. Many trials have shown that the optimal number of vertical layers lies
between 20 and 40 layers with thickness of 4 to 2m respectively or a vertical coverage to about
80 m ‐ Section 2.15.2 shows a sensitivity test of layers. Earlier experience with MIKE‐3 in studies
such as the City of Toronto WWFMMP waterfront modelling report tested the number of layers
and found similar results.
Figures 2‐1 and 2‐2 show a typical lake grid system, with the lake rotated so that the nested grid
area has a smooth shoreline parallel to one axis. Orientations with large areas of land or water
on side of the grid (triangular distribution) are un‐economical or wasteful in terms of computer
resources.
2.7 Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers
Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) are current meters which measure current velocites
at different depths in the water column of the lake where the current meter is moored. ADCPs
use sound waves to measure the water velocity. Many hundreds of “pings” per minute are
made and the time for the sound wave to reflect off of suspended particles in the water and
return to the sensors provides a measure of depth. Three sensors on the meter measure the
scatter of the wave and defines the current speed and direction in the “bins”. Bins are the
selected depths in the water column; usually 1m intervals are chosen and data are averaged
over 15 minutes to one hour. Temperature is collected at the ADCP deployed depth.
Figure 2 shows the location of Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) operated by Ontario
Power Generation at the Pickering and Darlington NGS. The data collected by these ADCPs are
available to use in calibration of the model. Additional ADCP data has recently been found and

will be used to verify some the model grids – although the data may not be in the same years as
the spill scenarios were run.
Other ADCP locations included Toronto Inner Harbour and NWRI deployments in Lake Ontario.
2.8 Thermistor Chains
Environment Canada operated temperature thermistor chains at a few stations in the lake and
this data has also been made available for use in the calibration.
2.9 Water Elevation
Water levels in Lake Ontario vary over the season, rising in the spring from the snow melt and
dropping over the summer due to drying conditions. This effect is added for increased accuracy.
2.10 Niagara River
The large flow from the Niagara River is included in the whole lake model to also increase
accuracy. While this river flow does not directly impact circulation on the north‐shore it does
have an impact along the south shore and is included for completeness.
2.11 Easterly Pickering Spill Grid Calibration
The first in a series of calibration exercises is the Easterly Pickering spill 270 m grid extending
from Pickering to Darlington – Figure 3‐2.

2.12 Application of Wind and other Forces
The next step in model development is the selection of winds. Single station data such as
airports are used to provide a uniform wind over the whole lake. There has been limited success
with combining several airports data, by some form of bilinear interpolation, to produce a 2
dimensional (2d) wind field.
NOAA can provide a 5km grid of their North American Mesoscale Atmospheric model at 1 hour
intervals. The NOAA model is a weather prediction tool which uses observed data at stations
throughout North America and is considered the most accurate 2d wind field available for
model use. The data is available from 2002 onwards.
The model was driven by NOAA wind field for 2006 and Pearson Airport wind for both 2006,
2007. ADCP data were available at Pickering for 2006 and 2007, and Darlington ADCP had data
only for 2006. Figures 2‐3 & 2‐4 show a comparison of the model predictions of the direction
and speed time series at Pickering ADCP. The model used 30 vertical layers with 3m thickness.
The simulation started May 15 with the water temperature set to 4°C throughout the water
column in all nested grids and the whole lake model. For years prior to the availability of NOAA
data single station airports were used.
Water elevation data from the Kingston gauge or Olicot NY gauge is applied.
The Niagara River is included as an hydraulic force, the water temperature is set to observed
data from the Lake Erie westerly Buoy (Port Colborne) operated by Environment Canada.

2.12.1           Fnorm Scores
The model results appear highly correlated with the data. The method used to measure model
accuracy is based on a vector average that uses both speed and direction called the Fourier
Norm (FN). The calculation involves the average difference between the two vector
components of velocity. In model terms the velocity is computed as a V component in the
onshore‐offshore (east‐west) direction and the U component in the alongshore (north‐south)
direction. Equation (1) describes the Fourier Norm as:
                                                       1
        vo , vc                          Nt          2

                                                                                           [1]
         v o ,0
and vo = observed data and vc = computed data.
The Fnorm scores are tabulated in Table 2‐1. The 2006 data spanned the entire year with a few
weeks missing in July, while the 2007 data covered the period of October and November only. A
Fnorm score of zero is a perfect match, a score of 1.0 mean the difference between the
computed vector and the observed vector (error size) is the same as the vector size, which could
be 180° direction difference, or small computed speed, large observed speed. These scores
represent a very good correlation with the ADCP data. Fnorm scores were determined from the
surface layer ‐ usually referred to as the TOP layer, addition layers were used, here the 5m
depth from the surface ADCP data was compared with the equivalent model layer.
The NOAA data perform well in 2006, having a slightly better score than the Pearson results. In
2007 the two wind sources are tied at the surface but Pearson scores slightly better at the
deeper layer. Similar results have been found in other years, sometimes the NOAA scores better
than Pearson or other airports.

2.12.2           Temperature Correlations
Figure 2‐5 and 2‐6 show the temperature prediction at the bottom layer where the ADCPs
measure the temperature. Again the data are very well correlated ‐ serial correlations range
from 0.9 to 0.95. There are episodes when the model has large variance with the observations
and this is usually attributed to the limited depth resolution and course vertical thickness.
Figure 2‐5    NOAA produced Temperature TS at Pickering ADCP ‐ bottom layer ~ 9m
Figure 2‐6    NOAA produced temperatures at Darlington ADCP ‐ bottom layer ~ 10 m
In terms of the hydrodynamics of the model, the NOAA wind field will be used when available as
it provides a good correlation with the ADCP data. When NOAA winds are not available the
most appropriate airport station will be used.
2.12.3           Comparison with other Hydrodynamic Codes
A series of simulations using a 2 km grid of Lake Ontario were performed by Huang et.al (2010)
at CCIW and the results were used to compare their codes with the MIKE‐3 code. Huang
compared the three codes (POM, ELCOM, and CANDIE).
CCIW deployed ADCPs in 2006, at the locations shown in Figure 2‐7.

July 24 and 1266 had data from July 25 to Nov 11.
MIKE‐3 vertical resolution was 40 layers at 2 m thickness. Multiple trials early on found this
configuration to be optimum for the grid size.
Other Model parameters – Quickest‐Sharp transport scheme applied. Constant wind stress

applied. Kingston water level also applied.
The Fourier Norm was used to score the various model trials.
Initial trials used Pearson, Hamilton and the AES buoy off of Grimsby, with Hamilton and
Pearson out scoring AES buoy.
CCIW provided a synthesized wind field based on measured winds at 6 stations in the lake,
spanning the period May 1 to Sept 22.
The NOAA North American Mesoscale model 5 km wind field was also available for our tests.
This data was scaled to match the 2 km grid.
Three models were used in the final evaluation, Pearson, CCIW and the NOAA wind fields.
ADCP data available at surface, 5 m and 10 m and were used in the evaluations, or depths that
were close enough.
The bottom roughness was left as the default value of 0.05 in all model runs. Wind stress
coefficient default value was 0.0026 was usually used, if a different value was used in a scenario
it will be noted.

The NOAA wind field has better FNORM scores. It is noted that the model appears to be able to
better simulate the directions of currents in the spring and fall period outside of the thermal
stratification period. The CCIW data is shorter term May start compared to April 12 and ends in
September. The NOAA results were tested for May to Sept 15 and had FNORM scores of 0.91,
0.92 and 0.98 for each depth category, which still outscored the CCIW results.
Figures 2‐8 and 2‐9 show the surface layer NOAA and CCIW directions and speeds compared to
the ADCP CM4 data. It is clear that the ADCP data has high speed events which the models
could not represent. The directional accuracy is fairly good. Figures 2‐10 and 2‐11 show the
CM2 results. Once again the speeds are very high, making the FNORM scores poor. The quality
of the ADCP data is suspect as speeds of 0.5 m/s in Lake Ontario are very rare! Lower layers or
bins in the data file might be better for comparison; however, they were not available.

Huang .et.al, on Lake Ontario and were able to achieve FNORM scores between 0.5 and 0.8 with
these ADCP data sets. Golders (2009) stated the MIKE‐3 calibrated model used for the
Darlington environmental assessment was better at representing the near shore dynamics and
was not got at mid‐lake simulations. This shortcoming is likely due to the vertical resolution not
covering the entire water column in multiple layers.

Some figures were extracted from Huang and used to compare with the MIKE‐3 results. We
could not provide a quantitative measure as the raw data from Huang were not available.
Figure 2‐17 shows the isopleths of temperature produced from the four different codes.
Figure 2‐18 shows the comparison of time series of temperature at the surface for the four

2.13 Calibration of the 270 m Grid ‐ Hamilton to Oshawa
This model domain was most frequently used in the spill scenarios. Additional calibration tests were
performed to address model parameters and model algorithms normally outside of the more dominant
model parameters ‐ Figure 3‐23 shows the 270 m grid.
Figure 2‐22 Extended 270 m Grid
The following sensitivity trials were run using 30 layers at 3 m thickness.
2.13.1             Dispersion in MIKE‐3
The internal code of MIKE‐3 determines the range of the dispersion coefficients for temperature and
advection dispersion, based on the grid size and bathymetry and possibly other parameters that are not
obvious in the user interface. Setting these values outside of the defaults usually causes a simulation to
not start or fail.
For example, the 270 m nested grid used for the majority of spills along the north shore, using 30 layers
and 3 m thickness, Table 2‐3 has the following model defines dispersion values for the temperature.

Four trials were run with different horizontal and vertical coefficients; the results for the Fnorm and
temperature correlation are listed in Table 2‐4. The Fnorm scores used the Pickering ADCP data shown
in Figure 2‐3 and 2‐4. While there are not large differences in the scores, the B scenario has a slightly
better temperature score. The B scenario was used in the spill simulations. The 40 layer ‐ 2 m layer
thickness simulation achieved higher FNORM scores dues to the higher vertical resolution.

                                             Report for Lake Ontario Collaborative Halton – Hamilton Focus
Each grid also has an entry for the horizontal and vertical dispersion factors. The default values are 0.1.
Trials with different horizontal values did not seem to make any differences. The vertical value does
impact the temperature stratification ‐ a value of between 0.01 and 0.0005 seems to be optimal for
good temperature correlation with ADCP data and water intake temperature data.
There is also an option to set the "formulation" based on;
       proportional to eddy viscosity
       proportion to the velocity
       tensor dispersion.
 Tests have shown the first two options produce almost the same velocity time series. The tensor
 dispersion has been found to have slightly better Fnorm scores, but the temperature time series is
 poorly correlated with observed data. The tests have not been exhaustive and further tests are
 required. For example when selecting the tensor option the user interface now provides setting the
 dispersion factor for three values per grid, the default values are all 0.1. The user manual does not
 specify what the values represent so it is very difficult to know what to set – (DHI personal
 communication states the values are for the X, Y, Z axis). Trials have found the default values will not
 complete a run. A trial with all values set to 0.001 works, a trial with the first two set to 0.1 and the
 third to 0.001 does not finish.
2.13.2            Model Sensitivity to Vertical Layers and layer thickness
Experience with the model has found that generally good agreement with temperature and ADCP data is
achieved when the model layer depth exceed the bottom of thermocline ‐ about 60 m. The one
drawback of the MIKE‐3 model is that the layer thickness is constant, and for deep lakes such Lake
Ontario, maximum depth ~280 m, means that to completely cover the vertical resolution many layers
are required which will slow down scenarios. It is thought that the layers under the thermocline
generally move as one whole layer and that representing the waters below the thermocline as one layer
is a good approximation. In the spill modelling and calibration layers to a depth of 80 to 90 m were
used, with either 40 layers at 2m thickness or 30 m at 3 m thickness.
A small number of trials (three) were made using the same general conditions but with 3 different layer
schemes. They were:
        Case A           40 layers 2.5 m thickness ‐ covering 100 m depth
        Case B           20 layers 5 m thickness ‐ covering 100 m depth
        Case C           10 layers 10 m thickness ‐ covering 100 m depth.
The temperature response of the model at the Pickering ADCP location is shown in Figure 2‐23.

                                            Report for Lake Ontario Collaborative Halton – Hamilton Focus
It is observed that Cases A and B perform very well, but Case C does not have a good correlation with
the ADCP data. The correlations for each case are:
Case A           0.93
Case B           0.92
Case C           0.69.
Model accuracy increases with layers and finer thicknesses improve the overall response of the model.

2.13.3           Wind Stress Coefficient
The surface winds provide the major forcing for the hydrodynamics of the Lake. The wind speed and
direction are transferred to the water surface by a wind stress equation which requires setting the value
of the wind stress coefficient. The default value is 0.0026, which is standard in many of the codes.
There is also an option to provide a variable wind stress function. This is best described by "5 ‐ 26, 15 ‐
36", which is executed as:
        winds less than 5 m/s coefficient is 0.0026,
        winds between 5 and 15 m/s, a linear gradient from 0.0026 to 0.0036 is used,
        winds greater than 15 m/s coefficient is 0.0036.

A series of simulations were made with NOAA 2006 wind field and different wind stress values, and the
model predictions were tested with the Pickering NGS ADCP data. Table 3‐5 lists the results, the
variable scenarios provide a slightly higher correlation. The constant 0.0026 value was used in most of
the spill scenarios.

There are four different schemes to describe the transport computations, Table 3‐7 lists the results for
each scheme, based on roughness of 0.5 and NOAA winds with variable stress 5‐26,15‐32. The Simple
Upwind and 3D upwind have better Fnorm scores at the bottom layer but the temperature correlations
are poorer than both Ultimate‐Quickest and Quickest‐Sharp. The Quickest‐Sharp scheme was used in all
the spill modelling.

3 Advection‐Dispersion Model Calibration
The calibration of the advection‐dispersion module uses a known discharge and observations of the
passage of the plume. The usual method is to release a known quantity of dye or some other easily
measured substance and track the plume over several hours or days. There is a historical event in which
a spill of tritium from the Pickering NGS was tracked from Oshawa to Hamilton. This is an ideal
calibration event.
3.1 August 1992 Tritium Spill
The Lake Ontario model was set up with an expanded 270m grid to cover the area from Hamilton to
Oshawa, see Figure 3‐1. The entire lake was modelled at a resolution of 2430m.
Figure 3‐1 270 m Map with Intake Locations.
The Tritium spill was released on August 2 at 0400 hours. The spill lasted six hours at a release rate of
0.000119 m3/s – total release volume ~2900 kg. The estimated Tritium concentration was 7.9 E+11
Bq/kg = Bq/L. It is understood that the spill was mixed into the cooling water channel and was
completely well mixed by the time it entered Lake Ontario. Tritium has a half‐life of some 12 years and a
first order decay rate of this order was applied. The discharge was applied to either the surface layer if
the vertical resolution was coarse or two layers if allowable.
Ontario Hydro Nuclear (OHN) measured Tritium levels at the water intakes and shoreline locations along
the north shore for several weeks after the event. These observations and were reported in Report
NA44‐REP‐03483.2‐0021‐R00, 1994, OHN. The data has been used to compare the model predictions.
Initially the tritium plume moved eastward impacting the Ajax , Whitby and Oshawa intakes and then
the winds shifted and the plume reversed course and then traveled west in one single movement and
Tritium was measured at all intakes as far as Hamilton.
A number of simulations were made in the calibration process. Historical winds were available at the
larger Airports situated around the lake, NOAA 2 d wind field data was not available until 2002. The
vertical resolution of the model was varied from 20 layers to over 80 at intervals from 1 m to 6 m in
layer thickness.

3.1.1 Dispersion Coefficients for AD Module
The default values were used along with the Eddy velocity scheme. If the time of travel is not in
agreement with the observations then fine tuning of the AD dispersion coefficients will not correct the
timing issue ‐ it is most likely the winds that are not correct.
3.1.2 Pearson Winds
When Pearson hourly winds were applied, with 2 discharge locations at split vertical layers, 30 layers at
4 m resolution, Figures 3‐2 to 3‐5 show the observed and model predictions for the western intakes.
Horgan & Harris amplitudes are very close, with initial peak times in good agreement. The tail of the
plume is too high in amplitude and lingers too long.
Figure 3‐2 Horgan & Harris
The rest of the intakes show a large lag in the plume reaching the intakes, while the amplitudes are
quite close.

There were periods in the Pearson data with zero speed and direction, usually late at night and early
morning, this could be caused by very calm conditions or the airport was closed and no readings were
taken. A combination of Pearson and Buttonville airports, Buttonville data was substituted for the
missing Pearson data, this method had less success.
3.1.3 Kingston Winds
Kingston airport winds were next applied, with somewhat better success, Figures 3‐6 & 3‐7.

3.1.4 Trenton Winds
Trenton Airport winds were tried next. The time of arrival at most intakes was very close. The amplitude
was low at Harris‐Horgan, which could be increased through some fine tuning. The Hamilton match was
very good. An additional trial was made with winds from Buffalo, and the results were very poor as this
station did not reproduce the current shift to the west. Several other trials were made and the final one
with 40 layers and 2 m thickness are presented. The time of travel (TOT) for Horgan (Figure 3‐8) is about
24 hours late and Harris is late by about 20 hours. The TOT to the shallow island (Figure 3‐9) is very
close, however the peak is over‐predicted. The westerly intakes from Clark to Oakville (Figure 3‐10)
have good TOT and the amplitudes are also in good agreement. The Hamilton plume (Figure 3‐11) has
good TOT however the peak levels do not reach the observed values.

3.1.4.1 August 2 1992 Tritium Spill ‐ Detailed Surface Plume Behaviour based
          on Trenton Winds
A series of figures are provided here to show the behaviour and evolution of the surface plume as it
moves from Pickering, first to the east and then westerly to Hamilton. The following set of figures show
the overall plume behaviour from release to impact at Hamilton Figures 3‐12 to 3‐22. Interspersed with
the Trenton winds simulations are four figures from the simulation using Pearson Winds. These figures
are provided to show the different behaviour of the plume when different wind sources are used. When
the surface temperature of the lake is compared with these figures – 3‐15 for example the large blue
patch of water intruding into the red zone “horseshoe” shape is a warm water plume which appears to
push or follow the tritium plume for several days. In addition, just before the spill there was a large
upwelling event which dropped the nearshore temperatures down to the 4° to 6°C range.
The time series of speed and direction at Pearson and Trenton Airports are shown in Figures 3‐12 and 3‐
13. The directions are similar until August 9‐10 where there is a shift between the two – which may
cause the different plume behaviours seen in the figures.

Figure 3‐24 Day 13 Trenton winds used – plume at Hamilton
 As this was an event, it was necessary to try different wind sources to make the plume travel as it must
have. There was a current reversal which suggests that a cold or warm front passed through the region
and each airport registered it differently, with Trenton records appearing to have tracked the front the
best. Buffalo Airport winds did not cause a current reversal.
3.1.5 Tritium Levels at Ajax‐Whitby‐Oshawa
The model over predicted the concentration at these intakes, the reasons are still unknown, and
ongoing work is trying to resolve this issue.
3.1.6 Other Model Predictions
Hurdawar‐Castro (2007) used the IDOR 3‐D model to simulate the tritium spill. The times of travel were
close at some intakes (model area limited to Harris – Oshawa WTP intakes), and the amplitudes were
also reasonable. The discharge amount did not agree with the published data.
The MOE – Peter Nettleton presented their MIKE‐3 finite Mesh model results at a recent workshop on
the Tritium spill (Candu Owners Group – Jan‐19 2012) . The model was able to match the observations,
however while the spill was only 6 hours long, they spread the spill over 60 hours to achieve their
results. They speculate that there was some re‐circulation activities that spread out the plume. The
MOE version used a bi‐linear interpolation of 8 wind stations around the lake.
The MIKE‐3 model was run with a 60 hour spill – and with cooling water and intake active – using
Trenton winds. The amplitudes at Horgan and Harris doubled, the westerly intakes time of travel were
off, Hamilton results were about the same as the original results.
3.1.7 Ambient Tritium levels in Lake Ontario
The model assumed zero background levels of Tritium. An extensive review by Fairlie, 2007, reports
ambient levels are thought to be 2 Bq/L, based on Lake Superior measurements in 1997/1998 ‐ where
no nuclear facilities are located (King et al, 1998). Lake Ontario was measured at 7.1 Bq/L by King et al.
Over 3000 samples of drinking water across Ontario had an average value of between 5 and 10 Bq/L
(Health Canada 2006).
Levels of tritium before the 1992 spill measured at the 4 WTPs of Toronto had levels between 9 and
16 Bq/L in the treated water (Ontario Hydro Nuclear, 1994).

3.1.8 Sensitivity to Wind Sources
Two simulations were run for the 2008 season, using the single station Trenton Airport data and the
NOAA 2D wind field data. All other model parameters were identical. The 1992 tritium spill at Pickering
was used as the source, with a release on August 2 2008.
The times series of tritium at the Ajax and Harris intakes were compared, shown in Figure 3‐19. The
model response is very different!
The Trenton wind simulation results were:
Ajax peak 40000 Bq/L and time of travel of peak was about 2 days
Harris peak was 200 Bq/L and time of travel of peak was about 15 days.
The NOOA wind simulation results were:
Ajax peak 0.01 Bq/L and time of travel of peak was 24 days,
Harris peak was 2000 Bq/L and time of travel of peak was 5 days.
The Trenton wind simulation had the plume move easterly for a long period and a reversal to reach
Harris ‐ while the NOAA wind had the plume move westerly initially, with an eventual reversal to reach
Ajax.

3.1.9 Lake Currents ‐ Different Basins
Lake Ontario has been characterized as having separate distinct current patterns in the western basin
(Hamilton to the Toronto Islands) and the central basin (Toronto Islands to Prince Edward County). The
lake currents predicted by the model for the January to May period were analyzed and the resulting
current‐speed distribution was plotted as a compass rose. Figure 3‐26 shows the current distribution
offshore of Etobicoke and Figure 3‐27 shows the currents offshore of Pickering. The Etobicoke currents
are generally equally distributed to east and west currents with higher speed events flowing westward ‐
possibly due to the larger fetch from the east. The equal distribution would indicate that there is not a
stable eddy in the western basin. The Pickering currents are biased to easterly flows in the majority and
with stronger speeds over the period. This current distribution with the major easterly flow would
indicate a clockwise eddy in the central basin.

3.2 Toronto Inner Harbour Hydrodynamic and E.coli Calibration
3.2.1 Toronto Inner Harbour Hydrodynamic Calibration 2007‐2008
The Inner Harbour model was calibrated with 2008 ADCP data, Figure 3‐28 shows the 90m nested grid.
ADCP data were available from October 30 to December 11, 2008.
The model was driven with NOAA wind field hourly data along with NOAA air temperature in 2
dimensions. Additional hydraulic forcing was supplied by the flow from the Niagara River with
temperature collected at the Lake Erie AES buoy offshore of Port Colborne. The Don River flow as
predicted by consultants involved with the Don Truck Sewer Project (MMM) was included along with
temperature.
Vertical resolution was 2m thickness and 40 layers.

The shoreline geometry is very complex, not as simple as the large scale north shore of Lake Ontario,
which is fairly uniform straight shoreline. The Inner Harbour, Islands, East Headland and Humber Bay
cause complex currents that the model is not always able to resolve.

Model was initiated on May 1 with 4˚ C uniform temperature.
Figures 3‐29 to 3‐40 to show the direction and speed as observed and predicted at each ADCP location
for the surface layer and mid‐depth. The ADCP directions in the Western Gap as consistent at both
layers, while the speed show some slowing at depth. For most of the data period the model tracks
direction with the exception of the first 7 days of November and the episodes of high frequency current
reversals. The model speeds are quite well matched changing with amplitude for the higher speed
events. The Fnorm score for the Western Gap surface layer was good overall with a value 0.94. Deeper
layers achieved better scores with a 0.86 for Nov. 7th to the end and the RMSE of 7 mm/s for both
components.
The Eastern Gap ADCP data has high frequency current reversals and 2 layer flow for some periods,
(upper layer flowing opposite to bottom layer). The speed events are somewhat similar to those in the
Western Gap. The model predicts high speed events for both Gaps, but the Eastern Gap observed
events are much smaller in amplitude. The Fnorm scores are poor with values well above 1.5, but with
RSME of 8 mm/s for each component. The location of this instrument was not in the middle of the

channel, but on the southwest corner, which may be the cause of the poor correlations. Ship traffic and
lack of clearance in the channel precludes the deployment of the ADCP in a better location.
Gibraltar Point (GP) had much better success with surface Fnorm scores of 1.03 – (after Nov 7 ‐ 0.69),
for the deeper layers and 1.09 with higher RMSE of 6.9 mm/s for each component (0.7 after Nov 7). The
ADCP surface direction shows high frequency “jitters” or variations around a mean direction, while the
deeper layer shows a more dominant current direction. The same behaviour is seen in the speeds. Thus
we have better Fnorm scores at depth due to a more consistent current regime.

3.2.2 Inner Harbour E.coli Calibration
As part of the Don Trunk Sewer Project, the Inner Harbour (IH) model was used to predict the water
quality impacts from over 50 discharges along the Toronto Waterfront. The discharges ranged from
large and small CSO and stormwater outfalls to major tributaries and large wastewater treatment
plants. The time series of flow and pollutants were developed for existing conditions and were used to
calibrate the IH advection‐dispersion module for E.coli. Intensive monitoring of E.coli over the summer
swimming period in the IH during 2007 and 2008 were available for the calibration.
The model first order decay rate for E.coli was adjusted during the calibration phase to match as best as
possible with the observed data in 2007 ‐ (a first order decay of 1.1 x 10‐5/s or 60% die‐off per day, T90
of 57 hrs). Other studies and model calibrations have quoted decay rates between T90 of 24 to 48
hours.

Table 3‐1 lists the model predictions for the IH locations along with the 2007 & 2008 observations for
the period June 1 to August 31, for the percent of time the locations (Figure 3‐42) is above the PWQO
for E.coli (100#/100mL). The assessment of the “model accuracy” was difficult as the model over
predicted the E.coli posting time at some locations and under predicted the times at other locations.
Adjusting the decay rate would improve the accuracy in some areas but make it worse in other locations
so an overall average was used as a final measure. The observations of percent time posted indicate
that 2007 was a dry year while 2008 was a wet year.
During dry years the locations influenced by the Don River (yellow) have similar posting rates, while
those not influenced tend to have lower posting rates. In a wet year (green) the Don River locations are
predicted to have higher posting levels than observed, while the non‐Don locations are predicted to be
about the same. This would indicate that the Don River loadings may be too large during wet weather
years.

3.2.2.1 Sensitivity Analysis of Advection‐Dispersion Coefficients
A series of simulations were made with different coefficients and “formulation schemes” – either based
on Eddy velocities or model vector velocities. The values were used in each test are shown in Table 3‐2.
The existing scenario posting rate – as shown in Table 3‐1 were used as the basis and the resulting
posting rates predicted by the new coefficient settings are compared in Table 3‐3 as percent change
from the status quo. The most variance is found at IH‐8 and IH‐11, the two stations farthest from the
Don Mouth. Trial D and E had identical results. The velocity formulation D had same overall average to
the Eddy formulation of trial B. Trial C had almost identical average to the existing scenario, did the
smaller values compensate each other?
The alternative dispersion coefficients do not produce large changes at all stations, some locations have
up to 10% differences from the status quo. If we look at stations IH‐10, the 2007 & 2008 prediction
value is over the observed value and setting the dispersion coefficient to schemes a, b, d, would lower
the predicted values. However that would affect the IH‐11 results which had the 2007 over predict and
the 2008 under predict, using any scheme would improve the 2007 but make the 2008 result worse.
The same would happen at IH‐8. Consequently, the default values appear to be acceptable. The
formulation selected also does not seem to cause major changes in the predictions.

3.2.3 Calibration of other Nested Model Domains
This section describes simulations made after the spill modelling was completed. During the spill
modelling period ADCP data was not available to use for correlations, and some spills had to be released
in years without ADCP data. ADCP data has been found and made available from the MOE. Figure 3‐37
shows Lake Ontario with the various 270m nested grids used in the spill modelling. The270 m grids that
were re‐run for ADCP correlation were Grimsby‐Port Dalhousie (Figure 3‐49), Burlington Ship Channel
(Figure 3‐52) Oshawa‐Cobourg (Figure 4‐1), Oshawa to Hamilton (Figure 2‐2 – main Spill grid). The
various Fnorm scores and time series are provided below.

3.2.3.1 Gibraltar Point ADCP in the larger Oshawa‐Hamilton Grid
The Oshawa‐Hamilton 270 m grid was re‐run for 2008 and the ADCP data collected at Gibraltar Point
was used to compare model results. The initial model configuration of 30 layers and 3 m thickness did
not produce a good Fnorm score although the Fnorm score of 40 layers and 2 m thickness did produce a
good value when run in the Inner Harbour configuration. The number of layers were increased to 80 at
2 m thickness and the Fnorm score improved to a value of 0.88. Figures 3‐38 and 3‐39 show the time
series of speed and direction.

3.2.3.2 Grimsby‐Port Dalhousie 270 m nested grid Calibration
The CCIW ADCP data from 2006 – discussed in Section 2‐14 – was used to test this model domain –
Figure 3‐49 shows the locations of the ADCPs. The Grimsby‐Port Dalhousie Grid was re‐run with 60 and
80 layers at 2 m thickness. The Fnorm scores were not good at all. The best scores were 1.27 for 60
layers and 1.38 for 80 layers for ADCP 1269. ADCP 1268 scored 1.68 and 1.8 respectively. Figures 3‐50
and 3‐51 show the directions and speed time series for 1269. The model amplitude for speeds are
agreeable with the ADCP data, so time of travel of spills will be reliable. The directions are somewhat
agreeable although there are periods of circular motion.

3.2.3.3 Burlington Ship Channel nested grid calibration
The CCIW ADCP data were used to test this domain – Figure 3‐52 shows the locations in the nested grid.
The Burlington Ship Channel grid had similar poor results as the Grimsby case. The Fnorm scores were
1.28 for 1269 and 1.62 for 1268 in the 80 layer setup. Figure 3‐53 and 3‐54 show the time series for
ADCP 1269. The overall amplitudes of speed are agreeable with the ADPC. The spill scenarios were
based on observed directions so the time of travel should be reasonable.

3.3 Calibration Summary by Model Domains
The model calibration of the hydrodynamics was limited to a few areas due to lack of data of observed
currents. Table 3‐4 lists the nested grids used in the spill modelling and the calibration.

3.4 Conclusions
The MIKE 3 hydrodynamic model was calibrated with ADCP and thermistor data collected from several
sites on Lake Ontario. The simulations have a range of accuracies, some great, some not so good.
Generally, the model can produce accurate simulations if the vertical resolution is deeper than the
thermocline, usually 30 layers at 3 m or 40 m at 2m resolution is sufficient for good correlations with
observations.
The advection‐ dispersion module was also calibrated with observed data from a spill and longer term
continuous simulations. The model was able to simulate the spill time series at most locations, while
the long term simulations had good correlations with the observed data at most locations.
A summary of the model calibration parameters is presented in Table 3‐5.
By comparison, Golders (2009) used the MIKE‐3 system to model thermal cooling at the proposed new‐
build at Darlington, they published the model parameters that best fit their observations.

4 Tritium Spill Scenarios
4.1.1 Tritium Spill at Darlington NGS
A spill equal to the August 1992 event at Pickering was modelled as occurring at the Darlington cooling
water discharge diffuser. The cooling water flow is about 150 m3/s with a 35 °C temperature, through a
diffuser 800 m offshore of the site ‐ the diffuser was modelled as 270m in length ‐ shorter than the
exiting unit. The tritium spill was again repeated at regular intervals (about 7 days apart) to sample the
currents to obtain both easterly and westerly events. The spatial extent of the plume at 7000 Bq/L (the
current Ontario Drinking Water Standard) and 20 Bq/L are shown in Figures 4‐1 and 4‐2. The 7000 Bq/L
plot is based on the 810 m grid that covers the shoreline from Pickering to Cobourg. The 20 Bq/L plots is
based on the whole lake grid at 2430, to show the extent of the plume.
The time series of Tritium at each Easterly intake is shown in Figure 4‐3.
The Peak levels are listed in Table 4‐1 ‐ along with the Pickering predictions ‐ for comparison. Table 4‐2
lists the results for the Westerly Intakes

5 Wastewater Discharge Spill Scenarios
The first three spill scenarios (Sections 5.1 to 5.3) examined the impact from individual wastewater
treatment plants on the local water intakes. These were "exploratory" scenarios to determine if the spill
of high levels of bacteria and ammonia would be a threat to the water intakes. Modelling results
indicated that ammonia was not a significant parameter and it was not considered further in the
modelling process. Bacteria were considered a threat so more extensive modelling was undertaken. In
addition to the impact of E.coli, other pathogens are associated with wastewater, so that if E.coli levels
are high, then it is assumed that other public health risks are possible.
5.1 Lakeview E.coli Spill
A long term spill of effluent from the plant was simulated. Bacteria level was 5,000,000 #/100mL and
first order decay was used. Model runs were made for a winter period from January 1, 2006 to May 1
2006 and for a summer period from May 1 2006 to August 31 2006.
The time series of E.coli at the closest intakes are shown in Figure 5‐1 for the winter period and 5‐2 for
the summer period. The peak levels for each intake and dilution ratio are shown in Table 5‐1.

5.2 Wastewater Treatment Plant Disinfection Failure
Two alternative forms of Disinfection failure were considered: (i) total plant failure and (ii) loss of the
disinfection process at the WWTP. The abstraction used to develop the spill scenario for WWTPs in this
report, are based on a total plant failure. This is abstracted from the total plant failure at the Peel
(Lakeview) WWTP but could also be caused by a prolonged electrical power interruption; for this
                                                      5‐2
                                                       Spill Scenario Modelling for Lake Ontario Intakes
                                              Report for Lake Ontario Collaborative Halton – Hamilton Focus
abstraction, it is assumed that there are no removal of E. coli through the WWTP, ‐ hence the effluent
E.coli density equals the influent E.coli density (5,000,000 E. coli / 100 ml). An alternative process failure,
rather than a total plant failure, would be only disinfection system failure; in this abstraction, limited
monitoring information available to the SPC team suggested that a typical primary – secondary WWTP
achieves approximately an order of magnitude reduction in E. coli levels (hence the effluent E.coli level
would be of the order of 500,000 / 100 ml) . A third alternative cause would be a plant bypass (
including a disinfection system bypass) associated with a major Wet Weather event to the WWTP;
because one or more of the WWTPs of the LOC are designed and built so that such a bypass can not
occur, this scenario has not been evaluated to date.
Each of the WWTPs along the north shore was simulated as having a total disinfection failure in the
plant and all effluent discharged through their respect outfall/diffusers. In the scenario that was
modelled, a two‐day total disinfection failure was assumed at each of the wastewater treatment plants,
and the two‐day event was modelled as successive events for the normal weather conditions found
during May to October so that different lake circulation patterns and speeds could be assessed. The
simulation date was April 25 to August 31, 2008. Each of the simulation results was enumerated to
determine the peak level at the various intakes upstream/downstream from them. The 270 m tritium
spill grid was used. Although a prolonged period with no disinfection is un‐likely, the extended spill was
used to sample the seasonal conditions in the lake, from isothermal to summer thermal stratification.
What is useful is the peak values and durations of events predicted, and these would occur even if the
spill was only for a few days.
Each WWTP was simulated at the design Certificate of Approval flow rate and the E.coli level in the
discharge was set constant at 5,000,000 #/100mL ‐ with first order decay in the lake. The Mid‐Halton
plant was discharged through the Oakville SW outfall; a new outfall for this plant is being planned as
discussed in an EA (Region of Halton, April 2010).
 Table 5‐2 lists the resulting peak levels at each intake of interest and the dilution ratio from the WWTP
outfall.
The Skyway and Woodward WWTP discharge inside Hamilton Harbour. Both discharges cause hydraulic
flushing from the Harbour to the Lake; the discharge E.coli Level was set at 5,000,000 E.coli/100mL.
Flows into the Harbour from Spencer Creek and Grindstone Creek were also included to mimic hydraulic
flushing caused by watershed runoff into Harbour; their bacteria levels were set at zero. Lake – bay
exchange cause by lake seiches were calculated internally by the model. The model grid was the same as
the Burlington ship canal benzene spill. Table 5‐3 lists the results.

5.3 Sanitary Trunk Sewer Impacts
5.3.1 Highland Creek Sanitary Trunk Sewer break
During the August 19, 2005 rainstorm, a major storm event, the bed of Highland Creek was scoured out
where a trunk sewer crosses and the sewer pipe broke, allowing a release of raw sewage to the
tributary. The estimated hydrograph, from HEC‐RAS modelling, of the flow is shown in Figure 5‐3.
The NOAA winds for 2005 were applied to the model, with Pearson data used for the heat exchange.
Figure 5‐3 Highland Creek Discharge Rate
The effluent was modelled as having a TSS level of 1000 mg/L and the E.coli level was 1,000,000 /100mL.
City staff estimated the discharge rate was 0.6 m3/s from the broken main and lasted three days. Figure
5‐4 shows the E.coli levels predicted at the Horgan Intake, the dilution was 14285:1. The peak level
arrived at the intake about 34 hours after the peak in the river flow. The raw water bacteria sampling
detected one (1) E.coli/100mL on Aug 21 at 0200 hours. There was another spike in bacteria at the
intake on August 25, which may have been caused by the storm event on a nearby tributary

5.3.2 Mega Event for STS Breaks Centered on the Toronto Area
Scenario 1 – Mega Event from Intense Aug 2005 rainstorm
This scenario assumes an intense rain event/wind storm similar in magnitude to the August 19‐20th
2005 event. During the August event, a number of roads and a trunk sewer were washed out due to a
fast peaking event. This event will involve simultaneous main trunk breaks crossing each of the main
tributaries along the Toronto Waterfront. The break was assumed to last 24 hours.
The daily average flows for each tributary were obtained from the Canada Water Survey Branch of
Environment Canada. The Highland Creek gauge was not operating during most of 2005 so an estimated
time series was provided by TRCA.
The trunk sewer flows discharges to receiving waters, were estimated as a portion of the design flow of
each WWTP that they service, the flows are listed below.
Rouge R (York‐Durham‐YDSS)               1.8 m3/s
Highland Creek                           0.6 m3/s
Don River                                2.2 m3/s
Humber River                             1.77 m3/s
Etobicoke Creek(Booth S T S )            1.4 m3/s.
The Booth (formerly Lakeview WWTP) STS break was assumed to occur at a crossing of Etobicoke Creek
and discharge at the mouth.

The sewer flows were added to the tributary flows at the river mouths ‐ no dilution nor time of travel
were considered for the upstream portions.
The simulation for E.coli assumed the ambient level was 1000 #/100mL in each tributary and during the
trunk sewer break, the trunk sewers would contribute 5,000,000 #/100mL. The ambient lake conditions
were assumed zero E.coli and TSS ‐ first order decay of E.coli was applied.
The simulation for TSS assumed 10 mg/L TSS for ambient conditions. Environment Canada estimated
the total loads of TSS for the following tributaries;
Humber River                       264879 MT
Don River                          49918 MT
Highland Creek                     15507 MT
The event mean concentration was calculated to be:
Humber River                       15500 mg/L
Don River                          4814 mg/L
Highland Creek                     1794 mg/L
Rouge River                        5260 mg/L (based on Highland Creek)
Lakeview                           2000 mg/L (assumed raw sewage level).
Figures 5‐5 and 5‐6 show the time series for each parameter.
The peak levels at each intake are tabulated in Table 5‐4.

(b) Scenario 2 – Mega Event occurring randomly over Summer Period
A second scenario was run with the trunk sewer breaks occurring at 5 to 6 day intervals over the
simulation period, in order to represent other current conditions in the lake. During these events the
tributary flows were based on observed data, which meant that STS breaks could occur during dry
weather or other flow conditions in the tributaries. Figures 5‐7 to 5‐10 show the time series for the
intakes.
Table 5‐5 lists the peak values for E.coli and TSS. The peak values are larger, indicating that different
current conditions can create high levels at the intakes, even when the tributaries are not flowing at
extreme storm flow rates.

Table 5‐5 does not define which tributary caused the peak levels at each intake. Separate simulations
were made with for tributary providing the high E.coli levels, while all others were at normal (non –
impacted ) levels. Table 5‐6 lists the individual contributions to each intake, the impacting tributary is
highlighted, and summarized as:
        Horgan is impacted by Highland Creek ,
        Harris is impacted by the Don River,
        Clark is impacted by Etobicoke Creek and then to a lesser extent by the Humber River,
        Lakeview ‐ same as Clark,
        Lorne Park is impacted by Etobicoke Creek,
        Oakville is impacted by Etobicoke Creek.

The Grimsby discharge causes a peak level at the intake of 3100 #/100mL, while the Port Dalhousie
discharge only causes a peak of 10 #/100mL. The percent time E.coli was above the PWQO of
100#/100mL was 15% for Grimsby and zero for Port Dalhousie. The spatial extent of the plumes at
100 #/100mL is shown in Figures 5‐13 and 5‐14. These plots were generated from the hourly data and
storing the locations where the E.coli exceeded the criteria.

6 Benzene Related Spill Scenarios
This section focuses on the impacts from spills that release benzene, a known carcinogen. Benzene is
added to gasoline to increase the octane number, generally in the range of 0.5 to 1 %. Any spill of
gasoline will have some small amount of Benzene, and Benzene is completely miscible with water.
6.1 Oakville Fuel Storage Tank Farm Benzene Spill
A spill of benzene at the Oakville Fuel Storage Tank Farm was simulated with the Lake Ontario Mike‐3
Model.
The waterfront from Hamilton to Whitby at a resolution of 270 m is shown in Figure 6‐1, with the spill
locations and the water intakes that could be impacted.
Figure 6‐1 270m Waterfront Grid
The storage tanks are rated at 26 million litres of gasoline. It was assumed that the Benzene
concentration was 1% and the spill lasted 6 hours. Therefore the benzene spill simulates an equivalent
release of 260,000 L over a six hour period. It is assumed the discharge is released to the lake in the
surface layer of the water after flowing down Bronte Creek. Benzene is fully miscible with water and will
subsequently be transported along the shoreline with the currents. The ODWS for benzene is 0.005
mg/L.
The method used for this, and other spills, is several random spills, about 5 to 6 days apart. This allows
sampling of lake currents over a range of lake conditions / events, both easterly and westerly. Benzene
was modelled as a first order decay of 6.E‐6/s, which also prevents a build up of benzene in the near‐
shore zone. This method differs from other simulations (such as for tritium) which tried to capture
specific events ‐ east or west ‐ with limited success.
The model was started May 15 2006 with isothermal conditions of 4° C and run until August 10.
The time series of Benzene at each intake was extracted from the hourly simulation results, the peak
values are listed in Table 6‐1, Figure 6‐2 shows the benzene levels at the impacted intakes.

Figure 6‐2 Benzene time series at intakes
The benzene plume is calculated to persist for several days at each intake. Burlington has two big
events in June, which have levels above 0.4 mg/L for 3 days. Other intakes have levels above 0.5 mg/L
for up to 2 days. The spatial extent of the plume at the 0.005 mg/L and 0.05 mg/L isopleths are shown

6.2 Mini Spill Associated with a Ship at Oakville Tank Farm
A small spill from a ship loading gasoline at the pier was modelled. Again, benzene at 1%, was released
during the event.
Three scenarios were simulated:
     1. 20000 L released in 15 minutes or 200 L of Benzene,
     2. 50000 L released in 15 minutes or 500 L of Benzene,
     3. 100000 L released in 15 minutes or 1000 L of Benzene.
The peak levels at each intake are tabulated in Table 6‐2. The results are almost linear as peak levels are
almost five times and double the base level from a 200 L spill.

6.3 Keele Tank Farm Spill
A spill from a tank equivalent to the Oakville Tank Farm spill was simulated at the Keele Tank Farm
(Keele & Hwy 407). The storage tanks are rated at 26 million litres of gasoline. It was assumed that the
Benzene concentration was 1% and the spill lasted 6 hours. Therefore the benzene spill simulates an
equivalent release of 260,000 L over a six hour period. It is assumed the discharge is released to the lake
in the surface layer of the water at the river mouth.
In these simulations, one a release to the upper Don River and one to the upper reach of the Humber
River, multiple releases were used, spaced at 5 to 7 day intervals. The Canada water Survey gauge data
for each tributary was also used as hydraulic forcing at the river mouth. The scenarios were run from
May 15 to August 15.
In these simulations Benzene has been set as a first order decay parameter, with a decay rate of 90%
reduction in 4 days.

6.4 Burlington Ship Canal ‐ Benzene Spill
A tanker trunk contains about 34,000 l of benzene. A spill from a tank lasting one hour was modelled
with the discharge to the Burlington Ship Canal.
A new model grid was used with nesting focused on the Western end of Lake Ontario. Figure 6‐16

Hydraulic forcing from Hamilton Harbour is provided by the discharges from the Skyway and Hamilton
Woodward wastewater treatment plants and from Spencer and Grindstone Creeks. The simulations also
include lake – Bay exchange, caused by lake seiches. The model grid and related data were available for
2008, so 2008 NOAA winds were applied to the Lake.
The model was run and current events that could potentially transport the plume towards the south,
impacting Hamilton and Grimsby Intake, or towards the northeast impacting Burlington and Oakville
Intakes, were evaluated. Suitable events were found on June 4 to the south and July 17 to the
northeast.

6.5 Gasoline Pipeline Break on Credit River
The simulation period was April 15 to July 7.
The pipeline flow was based on the average flow rate of 450 m3/hr, or 0.125 m3/s. Information,
available to the study team, indicated that regular gasoline, 87 Octane, has between 0.5 and 1%
benzene, added to increase the octane number. Assuming a 1% concentration, then 0.00125 m3/s of
pure benzene would be spilled during a pipe rupture. The pipeline flow was mixed with the river flow
and discharged at the mouth of the river. Benzene is fully miscible in water and it is assumed that the
benzene in the gasoline will fully mix in the river water ‐ there was no loss assumed from evaporation,
decay, or other losses.
The temperature in the tributaries were set constant at 20 °C, as was the gasoline temperature in the
pipeline. The lake temperature was predicted by the model, starting from 4 °C isothermal at start up
and developing the summer stratification.
The pipeline break was initially modelled as a six‐hour event. The event dates were randomly chosen ‐
usually about 36 hour apart. This method provides a typical lake response, and does not rely upon
selected directional events. Reviews by pipeline operators later stated a 2 hour break is more realistic
and subsequent scenarios were modelled as 2 hr events.
The Credit River flow was based on Canada Water Survey time series data.
A 2 hour spill was modelled, using the larger Oshawa‐Hamilton grid. The peak levels for this spill
scenario were:
Clark                    0.0003 mg/L
Lakeview                 0.010 mg/L
Lorne Park               0.091 mg/L
Oakville                 0.180 mg/L
Burloak                  0.041 mg/L
Burlington               0.0048 mg/L
Hamilton                 0.001 mg/L.
The time series is shown in Figure 6‐23.

6.6 Joshua’s Creek
The same method was used for a 2 hour spill to Joshua’s Creek. The Canada Water Survey gauge on the
creek was used to supply the streamflow data for 2008. The peak levels for this spill scenario were:
Clark                    0.0002 mg/L
Lakeview                 0.007 mg/L
Lorne Park               0.065 mg/L
Oakville                 0.150 mg/L
Burloak                  0.04 mg/L
Burlington               0.008 mg/L
Hamilton                 0.0001 mg/L.
The time series is shown in Figure 6‐26.

information about EIFH and its investee, Enbridge Income Fund (the “Fund”), management's assessment of their future plans and operations, which may not be appropriate for other
purposes. FLI is typically identified by words such as "anticipate", "expect", "project", "estimate", "forecast", "plan", "intend", "target", "believe" and similar words suggesting future
outcomes or statements regarding an outlook. Although we believe that the FLI in this presentation is reasonable based on the information available today and the processes used to
prepare it, such statements are not guarantees of future performance and you are cautioned against placing undue reliance on FLI. FLI inherently involves a variety of assumptions,
known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results, levels of activity and achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our
FLI and the FLI relating to the Fund. Material assumptions include: expected supply and demand for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids; prices of crude oil, natural gas and
natural gas liquids; expected exchange rates; inflation; interest rates; availability and price of labour and pipeline construction materials; operational reliability; customer project
approvals; maintenance of support and regulatory approvals for the Fund’s projects; anticipated in-service dates and weather.
In particular, this Presentation contains FLI pertaining to the following: expectations regarding and anticipated impact of dividend payouts, yield and growth rate; available cash flow from
operations (ACFFO); cash available for distribution and the components thereof; future equity and debt offerings and financing requirements and plans; expected future sources and
costs of financing; operating performance, results and expenses; future growth expectations and opportunities; continued strength of Enbridge Inc.’s sponsorship; projected trading
volumes; expected in-service dates and completion costs of projects; expected impact of projects under construction; outlook for oil prices, future supply of natural gas, oil and oil
blends; pipeline capacity and throughputs; tolls and competitiveness of tolls; ability to complete and timing of completion of market access initiatives; WSCB NGL capacity and demand;
safety and reliability of natural gas transportation; and downstream natural gas market.
Our FLI is subject to risks and uncertainties pertaining to operating performance, regulatory parameters, project approval and support, construction schedules, weather, economic
conditions, exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, including but not limited to those discussed more extensively in our filings and the filings of the Fund with Canadian
securities regulators. The impact of any one risk, uncertainty or factor on any particular FLI is not determinable with certainty as these are interdependent and the future course of action
of EIFH and the Fund depends on management's assessment of all information available at the relevant time. Certain FLI is obtained from third party sources, which the EIFH and the
Fund have not independent verified. Except to the extent required by law, neither EIFH nor the Fund assumes any obligation to publicly update or revise any FLI, whether as a result of
new information, future events or otherwise. All FLI in this presentation is expressly qualified in its entirety by these cautionary statements.
This presentation may make reference to certain financial measures, such as cash available for distribution and available cash flow from operations (ACFFO), which are not recognized
under GAAP. Reconciliations to the most closely related GAAP measures are included in the MD&A filings and/or Supplementary Financial Information available on our website or in the
slides that accompany this presentation, if applicable.

Enbridge's Intelligent Valve Placement (IVP): Illustrations
ENGLISH | FRANÇAIS (/Projects-and-Infrastructure/Public-Awareness/Intelligent-Valve-Placement-FR.aspx)
Isolation valves are used to control or halt the ﬂow of crude oil and other liquids, and represent an
invaluable piece of safety equipment on a pipeline system.
Enbridge's Number 1 priority, as a company, is the safety of the public and the environment, and the
operational reliability of our pipeline systems. Enbridge's Intelligent Valve Placement (IVP) program is a key
component of our commitment to safety and operational reliability.
Enbridge's IVP methodology is designed to ensure the right valves are placed at the right location, to
reduce potential release volumes along a pipeline corridor. Using thorough engineering practices and
exhaustive risk assessment, our IVP program takes such a rigorous approach to valve placement that it
considers and protects water crossings, as well as other high-consequence areas (HCAs), from potential
impacts to people and the environment.

Oil ﬂows downhill in a pipeline after the system is shut down. In a valley scenario as depicted, Enbridge
installs an isolation valve on each side of the water body.1 The speciﬁc valve locations (including distance
from the water body) are optimized through the IVP methodology.
Single Sided Valley
1 Valve Installed
 In this scenario, an isolation valve is placed on the left side of the body of water.1 However, on the right side
of the body of water,2 oil would drain downhill away from the body of water, and a valve would provide no
isolation beneﬁt. A valve would be more optimally placed downstream, closer to any water bodies or HCAs.
No Valleys
Liquid Remains in Place Naturally
In some cases, bodies of water are at high points along the line. In the event of a release, these areas
would act as natural isolation points due to gravity; oil would not be able to ﬂow uphill into the body of
water therefore no isolation valves are employed.1
Flat Landscape
Liquid Remains in Place Naturally
 Pipeline terrain tends to be ﬂat by design (a 70-kilometre stretch of Line 9, for example, crosses through
territory with little change in elevation). In the event of a release, oil would stop ﬂowing within the line and
remain conﬁned to the immediate area of the release. Valves provide no additional isolation beneﬁt.
Long Valley vs. Short Valley
Ideal Placement
 In the event of a release near a body of water at low elevation, longer valleys mean larger potential release
volume; in this case, isolation valves on either side of the water crossing, in close proximity to the crossing,
would be optimal.1 Conversely, in a short, steep valley, valves often cannot be installed close to the body of
water, due to the steep slope of the bank as well as the possibility of ﬂooding; and in the event of a release,
valves would only help limit oil drain along the short length of the bank, and provide little isolation beneﬁt.2
In some cases (Fig. 5B), isolation valves are not directly adjacent to the banks of major water crossings.
Instead, they are intentionally placed to protect not only major water crossings but also high consequence
areas such as additional watercourses, water intakes, urban infrastructure, and ecologically sensitive areas
3 – and exceed regulatory requirements in doing so.
Long Valley - Multiple Crossings
Ideal Placement
 For a long valley with multiple water crossings, the land between the crossings acts as a high point,
providing natural isolation from crossing to crossing 1. Optimal valve location at left is near the bottom of
the long, sloping valley;2 this placement, in effect, allows one valve to protect more than one water crossing.
Line 9
Example of Intelligent Valve Principles (Cardinal Station to 3543.1)
 From Cardinal Station 1 downstream by approximately 40 kilometres, pipeline elevation slopes generally
downward to the east. This long section contains no water crossings, and has elevation features that
naturally protect the HCAs in this segment. A large hill,2 acts as a natural isolation point for terrain to the
east. In the event of a rupture 3 only the cross-hatched area of the pipe 4 would be released, about 950 m3.
The rest of the product west of the hill would remain in the pipeline due to the isolation from the hill, even
though the closest upstream valve is over 40 km away.
Enbridge Risk Management Program
Valve Placement is one of multiple layers of defense provided through the Enbridge Risk Management
Program to protect people and the environment from potential risks associated with our pipelines.

Summary
At 0836 mountain standard time on 29 September 2001, a rupture occurred on the Enbridge
Pipelines Inc. 508-millimetre outside diameter Line 10 at Mile Post 1885.64, near Binbrook,
Ontario. Line 10 transports crude oil from Westover, Ontario, to Buffalo, New York, United
States. The rupture occurred in an agricultural field planted with soybeans. Within eight
minutes of the rupture, the control centre operator in Edmonton, Alberta, shut the line down
and began to sectionalize it. Remedial action response teams contained the spill to two general
areas, a natural swale running perpendicular to the pipeline and the pipeline trench.
Approximately 95 cubic metres of crude oil were released, affecting a 0.67-hectare section of
land.

Other Factual Information
At approximately 0700 mountain standard time (MST),1 communications failed between the
programmable logic controller (PLC) and the remote terminal unit (RTU) at the Tonawanda
Pump Station (Tonawanda) in the United States, making it impossible for the Edmonton Control
Centre to communicate with that station. The control centre operator (CCO) in Edmonton,
Alberta, responsible for Line 10 operations did not receive a PLC communications failure alarm
through the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system, since Tonawanda had
not been configured to generate such an alarm. The CCO first became aware that he could not
communicate with Tonawanda at 0810, when the commands he sent to that station were not
acknowledged. An electrician was immediately sent to Tonawanda to investigate the problem.
At 0836, the CCO noticed a pressure drop at the pressure transmitter at mile post (MP) 1896,
17 kilometres (km) downstream of the rupture location. Within eight minutes of the failure, the
CCO had issued “stop” commands to the pump units at the Westover Pump Station (Westover)
and Tonawanda, the stations upstream and downstream, respectively, of MP 1896, and had
begun sectionalizing the line between those stations. At 0854, the CCO noticed that the
sectionalizing valve at MP 1896 was stuck in travel and requested that the on-call maintenance
person check the status of that valve. The on-call maintenance person investigated the pressure
abnormalities at Westover and closed hand-operated valves, beginning at Westover. At 1003, the
Westover area supervisor located the rupture at MP 1885.64 and took measures to secure the
site. The on-call maintenance person was asked to assist with securing the failure site before
continuing on to MP 1896. The valve at MP 1896 was handcranked closed at 1117. MP 1896 and
locations further downstream are generally at lower elevations than the rupture site, which
allowed some draining of the line fill while the valve at MP 1896 remained open. Appendix A
shows a schematic of Line 10.
When the material balance system (MBS) model detects a possible leak situation, audible and
visual alarms are generated and transmitted to the SCADA system to assist the CCO in
identifying such situations. On the date of the occurrence, the MBS model generated the first
alarm six minutes after the rupture had occurred. This alarm was not transmitted through to the
SCADA system, since the program allowing that transmission had been inadvertently
overwritten following recent programming changes to the MBS model.
Following the rupture, Enbridge Pipelines Inc. (Enbridge) voluntarily restricted the operating
pressure on Line 10 to 4043 kilopascals (kPa), 80 per cent of the pressure at which the line failed.
Approximately 35 m of pipe, which included the failed joint of pipe, was replaced. The failed
joint of pipe was sent to the Fleet Technology Ltd. (Fleet) laboratory in Kanata, Ontario, for
analysis.

                                                   -3-
Remediation of the area included: recovery of loose oil by vacuum truck (approximately 35 cubic
metres); replacement of contaminated soil with clean soil; and bioremediation of residual
contaminated soil in place in accordance with a plan accepted by the provincial Ministry of the
Environment.
The section of Line 10 in which the rupture occurred had been manufactured by the Steel
Company of Canada Limited according to pipe standard CSA Z245.2-1971, using the submerged
arc weld process. This section of line had been constructed in 1972 and hydrostatically tested to a
minimum pressure of 8335 kPa. The maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) of the pipe
at the rupture location was 6667 kPa. The pipe had been coated with spiral-wrapped
polyethylene tape. The rupture occurred approximately 0.43 m downstream of a mainline
sectionalizing valve. The valve and Line 10 upstream of the valve had been constructed in 1971
and were operational during the 1972 construction. The joint of pipe that ruptured was the final
tie-in location between the valve and the newly constructed section of Line 10. Some wooden
skids, possibly used to support the pipe during construction, were found in the ditch at the
failure site.
Fleet determined that the pipe ruptured due to a combination of localized corrosion and
through wall cracking at the base of the deepest metal loss area. The corroded area extended
approximately 1.4 m axially and between the 4:00 and 8:30 o’clock positions circumferentially.
The fracture path occurred between the 5:30 and 6:00 o’clock positions. The remaining wall
thickness along the fracture path was approximately 16 per cent of the nominal wall thickness.
The calculated pressure at the time of failure was 5054 kPa. Fleet determined that the pipe met
the requirements to which it had been manufactured.
No unusual operating conditions, other than the inability to communicate with Tonawanda,
were noted prior to the rupture or on 28 September 2001 during a helicopter patrol of the
pipeline route. Operating pressures did not exceed the licensed MAOP prior to the rupture.
Before the rupture, Enbridge had not received any complaints by residents in the area.
The line has been cathodically protected by an impressed current system since 1972. In the late
fall of 1993, Enbridge took measures to enhance the cathodic protection (CP) system so that CP
levels would be restored at several locations that had been identified in early 1992 as having low
potentials. Since 1994, annual CP surveys have indicated that pipe-to-soil readings are within
industry standards.
The 508 mm section of Line 10 had been inspected for metal loss in 1990 using a magnetic flux
leakage (MFL) in-line inspection (ILI) tool. The 1990 vendor’s ILI report did not reveal any metal
loss defects at the rupture site but did identify three other sites that required excavation.
External corrosion was found at two of those sites; internal corrosion was found at the third.
Based on these ILI results, previous field excavations and leak history of Line 10, Enbridge set
the ILI interval for metal loss at 10 years.
The 508 mm section of Line 10 was again inspected for metal loss in December 2000, this time
using an ultrasonic wall measurement ILI tool and PII (Canada) Ltd. (PII) as the inspection
company. PII had not been part of the 1990 ILI inspection work. In February 2001, Enbridge
received a preliminary report from PII identifying 336 features, the majority of which were
identified as internal defects, and ranking them according to severity based on a rupture
                                                  -4-
pressure ratio calculation. The majority of the features were identified as having “echo loss.”
When associated with internal corrosion defects, echo loss indicates that the actual wall
thickness measurements were not accurately measured. When associated with deep external
corrosion, echo loss indicates that actual wall thickness measurements have not been recorded.
In this report, the defect at MP 1885.64 had been ranked number 59 in severity and was
identified as having echo loss.
PII’s ultrasonic wall measurement ILI tool uses ultrasound echo time technique to measure pipe
wall thickness. With this technique, wall thickness is calculated based on the time interval
between the reflection of the ultrasound signal from the inside pipe wall surface (entry echo)
and the outer pipe wall surface (rear wall echo). The entry echo can be accompanied by minor
noise pulses that, if measured, may be mistakenly interpreted as rear wall echos and provide
invalid wall thickness measurements. To avoid this, PII programs the ultrasonic wall
measurement ILI tool before each inspection, so that only pulses within a specified time interval
are measured and recorded. Minor noise pulses from the entry echo should fall outside this
interval and would therefore not be recorded. However, for deep external corrosion, where the
rear wall echo falls outside the measurement interval and is not recorded, an accurate wall
thickness measurement cannot be calculated and the defect is flagged as having been subjected
to echo loss. Wall thickness measurements of internal corrosion may also be affected if sediment
has been deposited in those cavities. Because sediments disperse the ultrasonic beam and shield
the beam from the pipe wall, the depth of internal corrosion cannot be accurately measured and
the defect is also flagged as having been subjected to echo loss. PII has recognized that echo loss
affects wall thickness measurements of deep exterior corrosion and interior corrosion with
sedimentation.
PII’s initial report in February 2001 did not provide above-ground marker information to allow
Enbridge to do field locates. By the middle of March 2001, Enbridge had received the above-
ground information and selected sites for calibration digs based on PII’s severity ranking.
However, Enbridge was unable to access the sites due to poor weather conditions. Based on the
preliminary data, the defect at MP 1885.64 had not been selected as part of the calibration dig
program. In April 2001, PII submitted a final uncalibrated report to Enbridge. The defect at
MP 1885.64 was identified in the April 2001 report as external corrosion with echo loss. It was
ranked number 44 in severity as a pit on its own, but when clustered with adjacent corrosion, it
was ranked number 14 in severity. It was not selected as one of the initial six sites to be
investigated for calibration purposes.
Enbridge conducted calibration digs in June 2001. Only internal corrosion was found at those
dig sites. Based on field measurements from the sites, Enbridge concluded that the ILI provided
conservative estimates regarding corrosion depths.
Following the failure on 29 September 2001, Enbridge had the 1990 ILI logs re-analyzed by a
third party. This re-analysis confirmed the presence of a defect at the failure site and suggested
that the metal loss in 1990 was approximately 40 to 45 per cent through wall.
                                                  -5-
Analysis
Since the failed joint of pipe had been the final tie-in location between the valve at MP 1885.64
and the newly constructed section of Line 10, the tape coating had been hand applied and may
not have been applied as tightly or as uniformly as that applied by mechanized line travel
equipment. The hand-applied tape coating may therefore have been more susceptible to
disbondment. The skids under the pipe may have exacerbated this disbondment. The disbonded
tape coating would have provided a channel into which groundwater could seep as well as
shielded the pipe from the cathodic protection current. Groundwater provided a corrosive
environment that contacted the pipe steel and allowed a corrosion cell to be set up. The pipe
wall corroded until the remaining wall could no longer support the stresses due to internal
operating pressures.
Through its ILI program for metal loss on Line 10, Enbridge had made an effort to ensure that
defects such as corrosion were detected, evaluated and repaired. However, the effectiveness of
an in-line inspection program depends on many factors including data analysis, defect selection
and inspection interval. Regarding the corrosion defect at MP 1885.64, the 1990 ILI was not as
effective as it could have been. The defect had not been identified in the 1990 ILI vendor’s final
report to Enbridge and was therefore not investigated at the time, although it was severe
enough to have warranted further evaluation. Because the defect had not been identified in 1990
and the inspection interval had been set for 10 years, the metal loss continued until the failure
occurred.
Data analysis is an iterative process, combining information from various sources, including
excavations, to better evaluate raw data and to further refine the assessment and selection
process. Factors such as echo loss, which affect the data, must be well understood and taken into
consideration when developing the excavation program and when using that information to
further analyze the data. Enbridge may not have been aware that measurements of external
corrosion subjected to echo loss are less conservative than those of internal corrosion with
sedimentation subjected to echo loss. Since only internal corrosion was found at the excavations
conducted in 2001, Enbridge may have concluded that all defects flagged as being subjected to
echo loss, whether internal or external, would be less severe than estimated by the ILI ultrasonic
tool.
There was no evidence to indicate that the PLC communications failure at Tonawanda
contributed to the failure of Line 10. The PLC communications failure, however, did make it
impossible for the CCO to access information from Tonawanda to assist in assessing the reason
for the pressure drop at MP 1896.
Findings as to Causes and Contributing Factors
1.         The tape coating disbonded in the vicinity of the failure, possibly exacerbated by the
           presence of wooden skids under the pipe.
2.         The disbonded coating shielded the pipe from the cathodic protection current and
           allowed a corrosive environment to contact the pipe metal.
                                                   -6-
3.         In 1990, the corrosion defect at MP 1885.64 was probably 40 to 45 per cent through
           wall but was not identified in the 1990 in-line inspection (ILI) vendor’s final report
           and was therefore not repaired at the time.
4.         During the subsequent 11 years, corrosion continued until the wall had thinned to
           16 per cent of its original thickness and the pipe wall could no longer support the
           stresses associated with the internal operating pressure.
5.         Because Enbridge had not fully appreciated the effect of echo loss in interpreting
           metal loss due to external corrosion, Enbridge did not select the failure site following
           the 2000 metal loss ILI as one requiring immediate attention.
Findings as to Risk
1.         A better understanding is needed by the pipeline industry of the effect that echo loss
           has on wall thickness measurements for internal corrosion with sedimentation and
           deep external corrosion.
Other Findings
1.         The programmable logic controller communications failure at Tonawanda did not
           contribute to the rupture at MP 1885.64 but did make it impossible for the control
           centre operator to know the status of that station during the initial response to the
           leak situation.
Safety Action Taken
Immediately following the rupture, Enbridge requested that PII complete an in-depth
evaluation of the data from the December 2000 in-line inspection (ILI). No further defects similar
to that which failed were identified. Enbridge continued with its field investigation program by
selecting six additional sites for further analysis. Since the results of that analysis were
inconsistent with the ultrasonic ILI report, Enbridge commissioned an inspection of Line 10 in
October 2001, using a magnetic flux leakage (MFL) ILI tool to calibrate the ultrasonic ILI data
and to provide more accurate depth measurements where echo loss issues existed. In November
2001, Enbridge received the reports from the MFL ILI and the calibrated ultrasonic ILI. Enbridge
concluded that the ultrasonic data that had been calibrated using information from the MFL ILI
provided the most accurate information for assessing defects on Line 10.
Enbridge removed the pressure restrictions for Line 10 on 29 July 2002, after determining that
there was sufficient evidence to confirm that there were no other defects similar to that which
failed at MP 1885.64.
                                                      -7-
Regarding the absence of the programmable logic controller (PLC) communications failure alarm
and the material balance system (MBS) leak alarm at the control centre operator’s supervisory
control and data acquisition (SCADA) workstation, Enbridge indicated that it has
•          begun a program to add PLC communications failure alarms at those stations not yet
           configured to generate such alarms;
•          initiated a study regarding PLC failure alarms; and
•          developed a comprehensive program of improvements to the MBS capabilities to
           monitor the health of the MBS and to ensure that alarms generated by the MBS model
           function as intended.
In addition, Enbridge is
•          discussing the issue of anomaly identification related to the 1990 ILI with the vendor;
•          continuing the excavation program on Line 10, based on the results of the ultrasonic
           and MFL ILIs;
•          enhancing the selection process for calibrating the ultrasonic wall measurement
           ILI tool by including internal, external and echo loss defects;
•          reviewing other technologies for inspecting tape-coated lines where sedimentation
           may exist;
•          considering an internal corrosion mitigation program for Line 10;
•          refining the ILI schedule for Line 10 based on corrosion growth calculations as a result
           of the analysis of the data from the ILIs and the excavation program; and
•          continuing to improve software management and leak detection performance testing.
PII has reviewed its records of previous ultrasonic wall measurement ILI reports and has not
identified any cases where echo loss has been associated with external corrosion. It has initiated
a client representation demonstration to ensure that future clients fully understand the issue of
echo loss associated with external corrosion. PII also indicated that it is researching
enhancements to the ultrasonic ILI to eliminate echo loss issues.
This report concludes the Transportation Safety Board’s investigation into this occurrence. Consequently,
the Board authorized the release of this report on 06 December 2002.

Filing Manual ­ Guide R ­ Transfer of Ownership, Lease or Amalgamation
(NEB Act Paragraph 74(1)(a), (b) and (c))
Release 2012­01
An application filed pursuant to paragraphs 74(1)(a), (b), or (c) is usually followed by one or more of the
following applications:
      review or amend an NEB decision, pursuant to section 21 of the NEB Act;
      leave to open, pursuant to section 47 of the NEB Act;
      addition to or modification of facilities, pursuant to sections 52 or 58 of the NEB Act; or
      tolls and tariffs, pursuant to Part IV of the NEB Act.
The information that is required for this portion of the application will be made available to the Board from
two sources:
      the company divesting the facilities; and
      the company acquiring the facilities.
Goal
The application includes information describing:
      the nature of the transaction that invokes section 74 of the NEB Act and the facilities involved;
      the new owner and operator; and
      the intended use of the facilities as well as any changes in the conditions of service offered.
Filing Requirements
The company divesting of the facilities must provide the following information:
1. Describe the nature of the transaction (i.e., is the transaction a transfer of ownership, lease or
amalgamation).
2. Provide a map or maps of the pipeline and the relevant upstream and downstream facilities, and identify
any pipeline facility that could become stranded as a result of the transaction.
3. Provide a confirmation that a copy of the records set out in section 10.4 of CSA Z662­11 and section 56(e)
to 56(g) of the OPR have been provided to the new owner of the facilities.
4. The estimated cost to abandon the facilities.
The company acquiring the new facilities must provide the following information.
1. Identify the new owner and operator of the pipeline including the appropriate contact information.
2. The original cost of the asset, depreciation and net book value.
3. The purchase price of the asset.
4. Describe the intended long­term use of the facilities.
 5. Describe any changes in the conditions of service offered on the pipeline, including the estimated toll
impact.
6. If the records set out in section 10.4 of CSA Z662­11 and section 56(e) to 56(g) of the OPR do not exist,
the applicant is to provide a plan detailing how it will acquire the information/records necessary to maintain
and operate the facilities safely.
Guidance
Circumstances of Application
NEB Regulated to NEB Regulated
When the pipeline is already regulated by the Board, an Order or a Certificate of Public Convenience and
Necessity would have been issued once the Board had determined that the facilities:
       would be constructed and operated in a safe and an environmentally sound manner; and
       were required for the present and future public convenience and necessity.
As a result, when a transaction involving the sale, conveyance, lease, purchase or amalgamation of an NEB­
regulated pipeline is to occur, the Board needs assurance that, notwithstanding any changes in operation or
configuration that are expected to occur, it would continue to be in the public interest to operate the facilities.
Both companies involved in the transaction are required to apply to the Board for leave to proceed with the
transaction. It is strongly suggested that the companies jointly make the application. Subsequent to receiving
leave from the Board to effect the transaction, the companies must notify the Board when the transaction has
been completed. At this time, the company acquiring the facilities must apply under section 21 of the NEB Act
(see Guide O) to have the existing Order or Certificate amended to reflect the transaction.
If the operation of the pipeline is to be changed, the acquiring company must also meet the requirements of
the relevant section(s) of the OPR or PPR and possibly either section 52 or section 58 of the NEB Act.
Group 1[11] pipeline companies not regulated on a complaint basis may be required to apply under Part IV of
the NEB Act if tolls and tariffs matters need to be addressed (see Guide P, Tolls and Tariffs).
Non­NEB Regulated to NEB Regulated
The acquiring company is required to submit the application and should apply concurrently under either
section 58 or section 52 of the NEB Act (see Guide A), as if the pipeline was a new facility, for authorization
to operate the pipeline. This would provide the Board with the information it requires to approve the pipeline
and grant an order or certificate. The company may also be required to apply concurrently under section 47 for
leave to open (see Guide T).
NEB Regulated to Non­NEB Regulated
The company divesting the pipeline is required to submit the application. Information provided in the
application should satisfy the Board that the public interest would not be harmed by the transaction. The
divesting company should also apply for the revocation or amendment, as appropriate, of the existing
certificate or order.
Transaction Details
If possible, provide:
       the certificate or order numbers for the NEB­regulated pipeline and related facilities; or
       copies of the equivalent documentation issued by the present regulator of the pipeline if not NEB­
       regulated.
Otherwise, provide the:
       legal name of the pipeline;
        location; and
       complete description of the pipeline and related facilities and the products to be carried.
In addition to providing the information identified above, also provide the:
       proposed date of the transaction;
       method of financing; and
       the operating status of the pipeline.
New Owner Information
Provide:
       the complete legal names of the proposed new company owner of the pipeline;
       if the owner is different from the operator, the name of the operator and the relationship between the
       owner and the operator;
       contact information for both the owner and the operator;
       a copy of the Certificate of Incorporation; and
       verification whether the province of incorporation is different from where the company will be carrying
       on business for the pipeline.
Maps
The map or maps should:
       allow the reader to locate the pipeline geographically within a larger region, for example, a province;
       include relevant details of upstream, downstream and surrounding facilities to enable to the Board to
       understand the relative importance and role of the subject pipeline;
       identify the appropriate regulator if any of the relevant facilities are not NEB­regulated; and
       indicate stranded or potentially stranded facilities.
Long­Term Use
If the long­term use is different from the present use of the pipeline, the acquiring company should provide a
description of plans for the future use of the facility.
Changes
If there are to be any changes to the condition of service offered by the pipeline:
       include a description of the status of the pipeline, (i.e., whether the pipeline is presently in operation,
       deactivated or abandoned);
       explain any changes to the type of service, or terms and conditions of service; and
       describe how these changes would affect the operation of the pipeline.
Describe any and all changes to who is financially responsible for liabilities related to the pipeline.
If a toll, tariff or negotiated settlement is presently in effect, describe any changes to the toll or tariff, other
than change in ownership. If no toll, tariff or negotiated settlement is presently in effect but third party
shippers are anticipated to require service on the pipeline, file a proposed tariff.
Group 1 pipeline companies not regulated on a complaint basis may be required to apply under Part IV of the
NEB Act if tolls and tariffs matters need to be addressed (see Guide P, Tolls and Tariffs).
Abandonment Funding
Provide:
         the total Abandonment Cost Estimate of the facilities being sold or transferred;
        a proposal by the seller for its existing letter of credit, surety bond or trust for abandonment funding;
        a draft copy of the purchaser’s letter of credit, surety bond, or trust agreement for setting­aside
        abandonment funds;
              if using a trust to set­aside funds, the dollar amount of abandonment funds that will be in the
              purchaser’s trust upon its establishment;
              if using a trust, a proposed trustee for the trust, and a description of whether or not the trustee
              is regulated under the Trust and Loan Companies Act;
              if using a trust, a description of how the purchaser intends to collect, or contribute, funds to the
              trust, as applicable.
See Chapter 7 Referenced Documents, Abandonment Funding and Planning for documents that describe the
requirements for pipeline abandonment cost estimates, set­aside and collection mechanisms and aother Board
direction regarding abandonment funding.

Endnotes
[11] In 1985, for financial regulatory purposes, the Board divided the pipeline companies under its jurisdiction
into two groups: Group 1 companies with more extensive systems; and Group 2 companies that operate
smaller systems. The decision also stated that Group 2 pipeline companies were to be regulated using the
complaint approach. The Board has also decided to use the complaint approach for certain Group 1 pipelines.
Under the complaints approach, the pipeline is responsible for providing shippers and other interested parties
with sufficient information to enable them to ascertain whether the tolls are reasonable. Tariffs, once filed with
the Board, automatically become effective and are presumed to be just and reasonable unless a complaint is
filed and the Board is convinced that it needs to examine the tolls.

          Enbridge Line 9 changing hands
          By Fram Dinshaw in News, Energy | August 20th 2015
          A controversial plan to ship oil sands bitumen across southern Ontario
          through a leak-prone pipeline took a new twist when the project changed
          ownership.
          Ownership of the Enbridge Line 9 route was transferred from its parent
          company to the Enbridge Income Fund, at the same time when 60 kilometres
          of this route is undergoing hydrostatic testing to ensure its structural integrity.

          “At a time when safety should be first and foremost on the minds of everyone
          involved with the Line 9 project, I find this ownership transfer timing is highly
          questionable,” said anti-Line 9 activist Louisette Lanteigne, a Waterloo
          resident who lives near the pipeline’s route.
          Enbridge is proposing to reactivate the 38-year-old Line 9 pipeline, currently
          inactive since last year, to ship oil sands bitumen east from the U.S. via Sarnia
          to Quebec. Prior to being shut down, Line 9 carried lighter Middle East crude
          west from the Montreal Terminal, via North Westover Station, to either the
          Sarnia or Westover Terminals.
          The pipeline has had nearly one spill a year since it was first built through
          Toronto and its environs 38 years ago, but municipalities often had no idea
          that any leakage had occurred, according to a Feb. 21, 2014, CTV report. The
          line had suffered 35 spills up to that date, five times more than those revealed
          to the regulators.
          Enbridge spokesperson Graham White told CTV at that time that all spills on
          Line 9 were reported, but leakages inside oil facilities could not be
          considered pipeline incidents.
          Nonetheless, Enbridge has also suffered ruptures on other pipelines, such as
          the 2010 Kalamazoo incident.
          It is this track record that worries Lanteigne and other Line 9 activists, who
          say that hydrostatic testing must be carried out along the whole route and any
          mergers deferred until after such testing occurs, to ensure that the proper
          insurance and emergency protocols were in place to protect the public.
          Hydrostatic testing is carried out by pumping water at high pressure through
          a pipeline to test its structural integrity and scope out any weak points at risk
          of rupture. Lanteigne and her fellow activists are calling on the National
          Energy Board (NEB) to order testing along the whole length of Line 9 instead
          of segments totalling 60 or so kilometres near Montreal and Kingston
          currently underway.
          But White said that the ownership transfer and financial restructuring had
          nothing to do with the hydro-testing of Line 9 or any other pipeline, saying
          that it was conceived “well before” any NEB requirement for hydrostatic

          attempted to ask White about this issue.
          Shell games?
          Lanteigne said that any new company operating the line had to not only
          assume all the liability and risks, but also notify First Nations, municipalities,
          and land owners regarding the pipeline sale, before hydrostatic testing could
          commence in earnest.
          But Lanteigne, who has previously attended public hearings regarding
          Enbridge’s proposal to use Line 9 for transporting bitumen, maintained that
          handing the route to a new owner could potentially compromise safety,
          despite White’s reassurances to the contrary.
          “The more companies they add to the mix the more costly liability risks
          become,” said Lanteigne. “It becomes very costly very quickly to sue, when
          multiple companies are involved with the same pipe.”
          John Quarterly, chair of the Chessmen Media Group, said that corporations
          often set up several layers of shell companies that force plaintiffs to sue
          through all the different levels, resulting in expensive court cases that can
          drag on for years. He alleged that such tactics were used by big companies to
          divest themselves of any responsibility in the event of disasters like a major
          oil spill.
          “I do not know how many of you know how the corporations protect
          themselves from being sued," said Quarterly in an email to Lanteigne. "They
          keep setting up subsidiaries that have shares in the company which they
          have split off from.”
          However White told Lanteigne that stakeholders and municipalities would not
          have to manage interactions with more than one entity, as Enbridge’s liability
          obligation would not change and asset transfers will be from one entity to
          another, not to a variety of holdings.
          “There is, in fact, more consolidation of assets now than before,” said White in
          his message to Lanteigne.

          Enbridge Inc. to acquire the company’s Canadian Liquids Pipelines business,
          comprised of Enbridge Pipelines Inc., Enbridge Pipelines Athabasca Inc., and
          certain Canadian renewable energy assets.
          “We have been conducting internal financial restructuring of assets in the past
          year or so that will have no impact on our liability, levels of insurance,
          operations or continuing commitment to the safety and integrity of our
          operations. They are primarily for greater and easier access to, and ability to
          raise capital, for future major projects and increase dividends to shareholders.
          We have transferred many of the Liquids assets, including Line 9, to the
          Enbridge Income Fund,” said White in an email to Lanteigne on Aug. 17.
          “There are no plans for merging with any external firms, this is an internal
          process to Enbridge-owned and operated companies.”
          Possible violations?
          Lanteigne also contacted the National Energy Board (NEB) to request
          documents that permitted Enbridge to change ownership of Enbridge
          Pipeline Inc.'s assets to Enbridge Investment Holdings Ltd, saying that “It is
          my understanding that is a normal process done to assure compliance with
          section 74 of the NEB Act.”
          “Enbridge is not required to seek NEB authorization under section 74 of the
          NEB Act for the change in corporate structure noted below, and has not done
          so. Hence, there is no documentation to provide in that regard,” said the
          NEB’s Andrea Caza in an emailed reply to Lanteigne on Aug. 18.
          But Lanteigne maintained that if the Enbridge Pipeline Inc. and Enbridge
          Income Fund were indeed two separate companies, then section 74 of the
          NEB Act would have been violated.
          “If Enbridge Pipeline Inc. and Enbridge Income Fund are not actually
          individual companies because they are both part of Enbridge Inc. as Mr. White
          suggests, then it is reasonable to state that all NEB documents that refer to
          Enbridge Pipeline Inc. as a company are null and void due to the simple fact

          that Enbridge Pipeline Inc. is not a company,” said Lanteigne. "The entire
          process was focused on Enbridge Pipeline Inc. as the applicant."
          The National Observer tried contacting Enbridge’s Graham White several
          times for more information, but did not receive a response at time of writing.

                                 2010, Section 1.4 Habitat Needs, pages 9-10 of 29 (PDF pages
                                 17-18 of 37).
      Preamble:        In Reference i) Enbridge states that Jefferson Salamander is listed as
                       Threatened on Schedule 1 of the federal Species at Risk Act, as well as
                       designated as Threatened in the Province of Ontario.
                       In its evaluation of likelihood of occurrence of species at risk (Reference
                       ii), Enbridge states that species-specific surveys for Jefferson Salamander
                       were not conducted but that potential habitat exists in the study area in
                       the form of deciduous swamps and fresh moist thick canopied forests.
                       Enbridge further states that impacts to this species are not likely to occur
                       as potential habitat areas are being avoided. Based on this evaluation,
                       Enbridge did not carry forward an environmental assessment of Jefferson
                       Salamander.
                       The Provincial Recovery Strategy in Reference iii) describes suitable
                       breeding habitat for Jefferson Salamander, as well as associated
                       terrestrial habitat that provide conditions required for foraging, dispersal

                                                                                 Page 2 of 9
          migration, and hibernation.
          The Board notes that the description of Jefferson Salamander habitat in
          the Recovery Strategy appears to be broader than that described by
          Enbridge.
Request:  Please provide either:
          a)       detailed rationale to support the conclusion that potential
                   Jefferson Salamander habitat would be avoided by the Project; or
          b)       mitigation measures that Enbridge would implement to minimize
                   impacts to Jefferson Salamanders or their habitat.
Response: The Provincial Recovery Strategy for Jefferson Salamander describes
          both the species breeding habitat and associated terrestrial habitat used
          for migration, foraging, and overwintering. The Regulated Habitat for
          this species, which is a legal description and is protected under
          the Endangered Species Act, describes breeding habitat only.
          Consultation with the MNR confirmed that no occurrence records were
          noted within the Local Study Area or within one kilometer of a wetland,
          pond, vernal pool or other temporary pool that occurs within the Local
          Study Area. Based on this information, the MNR was comfortable that
          no Jefferson Salamander or Jefferson dominated polyploid habitat for
          breeding occurred in the Local Study Area. As breeding habitat is not
          present, terrestrial habitat for this species also does not exist in the Local
          Study Area.

2.2 Species of Conservation Concern – Honey Locust
    Reference:    Application, ESA, Section 5.1.3.2 Botanical Survey, page 47 of 82 (PDF
                  page 61 of 96) [A3T0Z0].
    Preamble:     In the Reference, Enbridge states that Honey Locust was identified
                  within the Local Study Area (LSA) during botanical surveys. Enbridge
                  further states that it is a species of conservation concern due to its
                  restricted range, steep declines and few populations.
                  The Board notes that Honey Locust was not further discussed in the
                  Project Application.
    Request:      Please provide either:
                  a)       mitigation measures that will be implemented to minimize or
                           eliminate impacts to Honey Locust; or
                  b)       an explanation as to why no interaction between the species and
                           the Project would occur.
    Response:     The Honey Locust is located approximately 120 metres to the west of
                  the existing Line 11 pipeline. No construction activities are planned to
                  occur within 70 metres of this tree and therefore no interaction between
                  the Honey Locust and the Project is anticipated to occur.

                           90) [A3T0Z1].
    Preamble:    In its hierarchy of mitigation measures, Enbridge identified the
                 possibility of habitat compensation for the following wildlife habitat
                 features and species at risk habitat:
                     •    Reptile hibernaculum (Reference i);
                     •    Chimney Swift (Reference ii); and
                     •    Bats (Little Brown Myotis, Northern Myotis and Eastern
                          Pipistrelle) (Reference ii).
    Request:     In the event that impacts to any of these habitats cannot be avoided or
                 minimized through implementation of other proposed mitigation
                 measures, please:
                 a)        confirm that Enbridge commits to consulting with Environment
                           Canada (EC) and/or the province (e.g. OMNR) on habitat
                           compensation plans, including any monitoring or follow-up that
                           may be required; or
                 b)        provide an explanation as to why Enbridge does not plan to
                           consult.
    Response:    Enbridge confirms that consultation with Environment Canada (EC)
                 and/or the province (e.g. OMNR) on habitat compensation plans,
                 including any monitoring or follow-up that may be required, will take
                 place in the event that impacts to any of these habitats cannot be avoided
                 or minimized through implementation of other proposed mitigation

                         258).
    Preamble:  In Reference i), Enbridge states that the Project will cross three wetland
               areas, two of which are designated Provincially Significant in Ontario,
               using HDD and HDB methods.
               In Reference ii), Enbridge identifies open trenching as a contingency
               option should an alternative to the proposed trenchless methods be
               required.
               Reference iii) describes Enbridge’s proposed mitigation measures for
               wetlands, including mitigation measures for the contingency option.
               The Filing Manual (Reference iv) requires that applicants describe any
               applicable compensation measures for potentially affected wetlands, and
               that applicants consult with EC regarding mitigation for wetlands.
               The Board notes that Enbridge has not described any consultation or
               compensation in the event that open trenching takes place in wetlands.
    Request:   In the event that any proposed trenchless wetland crossing cannot be
               completed as planned, and a contingency method must be implemented,
               please:
               a)        confirm that Enbridge commits to consulting with EC and/or the
                         OMNR on wetland mitigation, including the need for wetland
                         compensation, and any monitoring or follow-up that may be
                         required; or
               b)        provide an explanation as to why Enbridge does not plan to
                         consult.

    Preamble:    In Reference i), Enbridge states that its cumulative effects assessment
                 included a review of past, present and future projects; however, none
                 were identified within the spatial and temporal boundaries established for
                 the Project. Enbridge further states that it concludes that no cumulative
                 effects were therefore expected.
                 In Reference ii), Enbridge refers to the proposed Line 10 replacement
                 project, which would take place in the same pipeline corridor as Line 11
                 between Westover Station and Nanticoke Junction.
    Request:     Please explain why the proposed Line 10 replacement project was not
                 considered in the cumulative effects assessment for the Project, given
                 that it would occur within the same pipeline corridor.
    Response:    The proposed Line 10 replacement project was not considered in the
                 cumulative effects assessment for the Project because, while the Line 10
                 replacement project was under consideration by Enbridge, the project had
                 not been applied for and was not under review by the NEB or other
                 regulatory authorities for approval. Information related to scope and
                 timing was uncertain at the time of completing the Line 11 replacement
                 project environmental assessment, and remains uncertain as Enbridge
                 continues to analyze alternatives and requirements related to Line 10.

    Preamble:    In Reference i), 7 cross-sectional diagrams show the location and spacing
                 of existing and proposed pipelines within the existing 18.3 m right-of-
                 way (ROW) and proposed new ROW.
                 In cross-sections 1 through 4 (KP 2998.757 to KP 3000.211), the spacing
                 between the proposed replacement Line 11 and the nearest existing
                 pipeline becomes progressively wider (3 m, 4.2 m, 6.6 m and 12.1 m,
                 respectively). Additional ROW space requirements range from 3 m to 6
                 m.
                 In cross-sections 5 through 7 (KP 3000.493 to KP 3001.457), the
                 proposed replacement Line 11 would be spaced approximately 3 m from
                 the closest existing pipeline. No additional ROW space is required.
                 Alignment Sheets in Reference ii) show the location of the cross-sections
                 as well as the proposed new ROW space requirements.
    Request:     For the section of pipeline corridor between cross-sections 1 and 4,
                 please provide the rationale for the increased spacing between the
                 proposed Line 11 replacement pipeline and the existing pipelines.
    Response:    The rationale for the increased spacing between the proposed Line 11
                 replacement pipeline and the existing pipelines between cross-sections 1
                 and 4 is the result of two main factors. First, the geological features of
                 the specific area consist of extensive and continuous surficial and sub-
                 surface rock formation. As such, additional spacing is required to ensure
                 the integrity of existing infrastructure in the face of horizontal directional
                 drill and open trenching activity and equipment on and adjacent to the
                 existing right-of-way. Second, additional spacing is planned between the
                 proposed Line 11 replacement pipeline and the existing Line 11 pipeline
                 in cross-section 4 to accommodate a specific landowner request to
                 preserve trees on the east side of the landowner’s property.

                                       EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report develops design ground motions for Ontario Power Generation’s (OPG) proposed
Deep Geologic Repository (DGR) project at the Bruce nuclear site in the Municipality of
Kincardine, Ontario. One important aspect of site evaluation is the assessment of the
earthquake ground motions that could occur during the design/service life of the DGR. To
provide adequate protection for the public and the environment, the DGR would be designed to
withstand the effects of very rare events, including the occurrence of strong earthquake ground
shaking at the site. A probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA) was conducted for the
DGR that incorporates uncertainties in the models and parameters that affect seismic hazard.
Guidance on conducting a PSHA, with the goal of capturing the knowledge of the informed
scientific community regarding the inputs to the analysis, was provided in a landmark report by
the Senior Seismic Hazard Advisory Committee (SSHAC). In the PSHA for the Bruce nuclear
site, the interpretations of the larger scientific community were incorporated by way of review of
the available literature, as well as correspondence with researchers to obtain unpublished data
and observations in a SSHAC Level 2 process. The study for the Bruce nuclear site builds on
both the 1997 PSHA sponsored by the Atomic Energy Control Board to characterize seismic
hazards in southern Ontario and a recent PSHA conducted for the region surrounding the
Darlington nuclear site for OPG.
In the PSHA for the Bruce nuclear site, future earthquakes that may affect the site are modeled
using seismic sources. Seismic source characterization provides a probabilistic model for the
rate of occurrence, spatial distribution, and size distribution of earthquakes within the region
surrounding the site. The Bruce nuclear site lies in the stable continental region of eastern
North America in an area of low, diffuse seismicity with no identified active faults. In such
regions the primary data set used to develop a probabilistic model is the catalogue of regional
earthquakes. The earthquake catalogue is limited by the duration of the sample (a few hundred
years), and imperfect recording of past events, particularly in the period before the development
of modern seismic monitoring networks. Thus, interpretations of other data, guided by scientific
knowledge of the earthquake process, are used to extend the earthquake catalogue data to
model the future occurrence of potentially damaging earthquakes in the site region. To do so,
alternative models for the spatial distribution of future earthquakes are constructed based on
interpretations of regions of the earth’s crust that have homogeneous properties. These regions
represent seismic sources in a PSHA.
The seismic source model developed for the Bruce nuclear site consists primarily of large
regional seismic source zones used to model the occurrence of distributed earthquake activity.
Uncertainty in characterizing the spatial distribution of future earthquakes within these sources
was incorporated by the use of alternative source zone boundaries and spatial distribution
models. In addition, the probabilistic model included a number of specific geologic/geophysical
features that have been proposed in the scientific literature as potential active seismic sources.
Most of these are located near the western end of Lake Ontario, but two of these, the Grenville
Front tectonic zone and the Georgian Bay linear zone, extend closer to the site. A key
uncertainty in the assessment of these potential local seismic sources is whether or not a
source is seismogenic, defined as active and capable of generating moderate-to-large
earthquakes. Multiple criteria, which include spatial association with seismicity and geologic
evidence for brittle slip in the present stress/tectonic regime, are used to assess the probability
that a source is seismogenic.
The results of the PSHA conducted for the Bruce nuclear site provide uniform hazard response
spectra (UHRS) at the surface for a reference hard rock site. The UHRS were calculated for
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                        - vi -                             March 2011
annual exceedance frequencies (AEF) in the range of 10-2 to 10-8 (return periods of 100 to
108 years). The regional source zones were found to be the dominant contributors to the
hazard. The contribution of individual assessments to the uncertainty for various components in
the seismic hazard computation was also examined. The results indicated that selection of the
appropriate ground motion models is the largest contributor to the uncertainty in seismic hazard.
The results of the PSHA are generally consistent with values published in the 2005 National
Building Code of Canada (NBCC) when corrected to a common site condition and accounting
for the differences in the selected ground motion models used in the two studies. The result of
the PSHA indicate that the estimated ground motions at the surface on hard rock are expected
to be less than 1.0g for annual exceedance frequencies of 10-5, the reference case, and 10-6,
the extreme case. The following table summarized the results of the PSHA.

Completion of the development of design ground motions involved translating the reference
hard rock PSHA results to appropriate horizons within the proposed DGR in a manner that
preserves the probabilistic levels assigned to each UHRS. A probabilistic model for site
response was developed utilizing measured dynamic properties of the site geologic units. This
model was then used to develop UHRS at the DGR level (depth 680 m) and at seven selected
reference horizon levels between the surface and the repository. In addition UHRS were
developed for the ground surface for three representative site conditions which reflect
differences in the amount of surficial material that may be removed. These UHRS are provided
for both horizontal and vertical motions.
The final task was to develop design time histories for the DGR and selected horizon levels. In
order to represent the hazard with realistic earthquake motions, three earthquake scenarios
were developed to represent the range of earthquakes contributing to the site hazard.
Acceleration time histories were then spectrally matched to response spectra for these scenario
earthquakes. The envelope of the response spectra for the three scenario earthquake time
histories provides a good match to the DGR and horizon UHRS.

1.        INTRODUCTION
Investigations are being conducted to confirm the suitability of the Bruce nuclear site in the
Municipailty of Kincardine to safely host Ontario Power Generation’s (OPG) proposed Deep
Geologic Repository (DGR) for permanent storage of Low and Intermediate Level Waste
(L&ILW). This report presents information for a seismic hazard assessment of, and the
development of design ground motions for, the Bruce nuclear site.
1.1       Objectives
The scope of work for this study consisted of two tasks: (1) develop a seismic hazard model,
and, (2) perform a probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA) to assess the ground
shaking hazard at the Bruce nuclear site. A seismic hazard model was developed that
involved compiling an earthquake catalogue for the region surrounding the site and identifying
and characterising regional seismic source zones and local seismic sources. Hazard analyses
were conducted for peak ground acceleration and response spectral accelerations covering
the frequency range of importance.
The goal of all PSHAs should be to capture the state of knowledge of the informed scientific
community regarding the inputs to the analysis. For the present study, the interpretations of
the larger scientific community were incorporated through a review of the available literature,
combined with correspondence with researchers to obtain unpublished data and observations.
This study builds on the PSHA conducted for the Darlington nuclear site region for OPG. This
study follows the guidance of the Senior Seismic Hazard Advisory Committee (SSHAC 1997),
“Recommendations for Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis: Guidance on Uncertainty and
Use of Experts.” Four levels of study for conducting a PSHA are defined by SSHAC (1997);
required resources and the level of sophistication increase from Level 1 through to Level 4. A
Level 2 PSHA was developed for this study in which a Technical Integrator (TI) team - the
AMEC Geomatrix project team, led by Drs. Robert Youngs and Roseanne C. Perman -
conducted a PSHA for the Bruce nuclear site based on all available information.

2.          GENERAL SITE DESCRIPTION AND CHARACTERISTICS
2.1         Site Location and Description
The Bruce nuclear site is located adjacent to the west shore of Lake Huron, in the Municipailty
of Kincardine, Ontario. To assess the seismic hazard for this site, a study region has been
defined between latitudes 38°N to 50°N and longitudes 65°W to 90°W (Figure 2.1). Seismic
activity in the vicinity of the site is low, although it is higher to the east (Figure 2.1). The
seismic sources to the east of the site have the greatest potential impact on the seismic hazard
of the Bruce nuclear site.

2.2         Regional Structure and Geologic History
The Bruce nuclear site lies within the eastern Lake Huron region of southwestern Ontario, in
the tectonically stable interior of the North American continent. The site is underlain by Middle
Proterozoic Grenville basement (Bickford et al. 1986, Rankin et al. 1993, Johnston et al. 1994)
and approximately 850 meters (m) of Paleozoic sediment strata that unconformably overly
altered Precambrian granitic gneiss basement rocks (INTERA1 2011). The Paleozoic rocks
range in age from Cambrian to Middle Devonian and consist primarily of limestone and shale
deposited in shallow marine environments. Inferred basement within the study region includes

crust from the Superior, Southern Granite-Rhyolite, and Grenville provinces, and the East
Continent rift and Midcontinent rift (Figure 2.2). These units are covered by Paleozoic
sediments structurally arranged in basins and arches (Figure 2.3) as a response to Paleozoic
tectonic events, including the Penobscottian, Taconian, Salinian, Acadian, and Alleghenian
orogenies (Figure 2.4 and Table 2.1).

The Phanerozoic tectonic regime along the eastern margin of North America has been
described in terms of two tectonic cycles, known as “Wilson cycles” (see Sanford et al. 1985).
Three major tectonic events affected this region:
   Late Proterozoic/early Paleozoic rifting to form the Iapetus (proto-Atlantic) Ocean;
   Middle to late Paleozoic closure of the Iapetan Ocean basin, accompanied by subduction
    of Iapetan crust and multiple arc-continent and continent-continent collisional episodes of
    Appalachian mountain building; and

   Mesozoic rifting to form the present-day Atlantic Ocean (e.g., Klitgord et al. 1988,
    Hatcher et al. 1989, Milkereit et al. 1992).
It has been shown that, worldwide, the seismic potential of a stable continental region varies
according to the degree of crustal extension that it experienced in the geologic past, and to a
lesser extent, the age of the crust (Johnston et al. 1994). Three types of crust are identified in
eastern North America:
   Unrifted—the craton and the Appalachian fold belt;
   Failed intracontinental rifts—the Ottawa and Saguenay aulacogens and the Reelfoot rift
    complex; and
   Rifted passive continental margin—the Atlantic passive margin produced by the present
    opening of the Atlantic Ocean in the late Mesozoic (Figure 2.5), and a relic passive margin
    produced by Iapetan rifting in the Late Proterozoic/early Paleozoic (Johnston et al. 1994).
The following subsections review the tectonic history and structural evolution of key features in
the Bruce nuclear site region.

2.2.1     Superior Province
The earliest geologic history of the Bruce site region consists of the assembly of the Superior
province (Table 2.1). The Superior province consists of greenstone belts with granitic plutonic
rocks, granitic gneisses, and gneissic and migmatitic rocks dating from 3.6 to
2.6 billion years ago (Ga) (Van Schmus 1992). These lithologies are arranged in linear,
fault-bounded subprovinces with distinctive rock types, ages, and metamorphic conditions
(Thurston 1992a). Hoffman (1989) interpreted granite-greenstone belts as volcanic-plutonic
island arcs, metasedimentary belts as accretionary prisms, plutonic belts as continental slivers
within island arcs, and high-grade gneiss/granulite complexes as deeper erosion levels of
other belt types. These belts were assembled progressively from north to south at
approximately 2.7 Ga, during the oblique dextral transpressive Kenoran Orogeny.

north-dipping structures consistent with south-to-southeast vergent thrusting (Benn et al. 1994,
Kellet et al. 1994). In subsequent Proterozoic tectonic events, the Superior province formed
the lithospheric core during the assembly of the continent Laurentia (Hoffman 1988, 1989).
2.2.2     Southern Province
The Southern province consists of rocks initially deposited on the southern margin of the
Superior province and deformed during the Penokean orogen (Figure 2.2). These rocks
include siliceous, continental margin sedimentary rocks of the 2.4 – 2.2 Ga Huronian
Supergroup, and deformed, rifted passive margin sequence of the 2.2 – 1.7 Ga Marquette
Range Supergroup, overlain by a synorogenic foredeep sequence of the Animikie Group
(Thurston 1992b). A poorly documented deformation event recorded in the Huronian
Supergroup is thought to be younger than 2.2 Ga; however, much of the deformation in these
deposits is attributed to the Penokean Orogeny. This event involved the collision of the an
island arc (Cannon et al. 1991), with rocks of the Huronian Supergroup and Marquette Range
Supergroup along the Niagara Fault between 1.88 and 1.86 Ga (Whitmeyer and Karlstrom
2007). Between 1.86 and 1.84 Ga, The Archean Marshfield terrane subsequently collided with
a younger, north-vergent arc complex along the Eau Pleine shear zone (Whitmeyer and
Karlstrom 2007, Cannon et al. 1991). These structural relationships were imaged in GLIMPCE
(Great Lakes International Multidisciplinary Program on Crustal Evolution) seismic profile H
(Figure 2.6) (Cannon et al. 1991). Post-tectonic granites intrude the Penokean orogenic belt
and the Niagara fault zone, which pins the end of the collisional event at 1.83 Ga
(Whitmeyer and Karlstrom 2007).
2.2.3     Granite Rhyolite Province
The Granite Rhyolite province consists of 1.47 – 1.37 Ga granite and felsic volcanic rocks of
the midcontinent region (Van Schmus et al. 1996). Van Schmus (1992) interpreted these
rocks as a veneer of supercrustal and shallow plutonic rocks that lie on Early Proterozoic crust
of the Central Plains orogeny (a 1.8 – 1.6 Ga terrane to the west of the study region), from
which they were derived by partial melting. Van Schmus et al. (1996) defined a
northeast-southwest-trending Nd isotope boundary extending from southwestern Ontario to
southeastern Oklahoma that separates Paleoproterozoic crust to the northwest and
Mesoproterozoic (ca. 1.5 Ga) juvenile crust to the southeast. The Granite Rhyolite province
was intruded by Mesoproterozoic “anorogenic” plutons, which extend from Colorado into
Labrador (Van Schmus et al. 1996). There is increasing evidence for an orogenic link for the
bimodal A-type granites involving continental arc magmatism and the collision of juvenile rocks
along the margin of Laurentia. Rivers and Corrigan (2000) propose that a continental margin
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                         - 12 -                                 March 2011
magmatic arc existed along the southeastern margin of Laurentia from Texas to Labrador
between 1,500 and 1,230 million years ago (Ma). Some of these rocks were incorporated into
the Grenville province in subsequent tectonic events.
Few structural relationships are known about the Granite Rhyolite province. Consortium for
Continental Reflection Profiling (COCORP) lines IL-1 in Illinois, IN-1 in Indiana, and the
western portion of OH-1 in Ohio (Figure 2.6) image discontinuous, subhorizontal reflectors that
can be traced laterally for up to 80 km, representing a layered assemblage as thick as 11 km
(Pratt et al. 1989). Pratt et al. (1989) interpreted these reflectors as felsic igneous rocks
underlain or intermixed with mafic igneous or sedimentary rocks. This discontinuous layering
is absent in COCORP lines MO-1 and IL-2, which transect the Proterozoic caldera complexes
of the St. Francois Mountains.

2.2.4     East Continent and Midcontinent Rift Systems
Two major continental rifts developed along the eastern margin of Laurentia after
emplacement of the Eastern Granite-Rhyolite province rocks. The first of these was the East
Continent rift, which contains the northwest-trending Fort Wayne rift in western Ohio and
eastern Indiana (Figure 2.7). Drahovzal et al. (1992) identified the East Continent Rift Basin
(ECRB) based on: (1) presence of Middle Run formation (a lithic arenite interbedded with
basalt); (2) association with the East Continent gravity high (ECGH), a northwest-trending
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                              - 13 -                           March 2011
positive gravity anomaly that extends across Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Kentucky and is
coincident with the Fort Wayne rift in Indiana and Ohio; and (3) magnetic anomalies coincident
with gravity anomalies, suggesting deep-rooted bodies of mafic composition, possibly
emplaced during rifting. The ECRB and Fort Wayne rift have uncertain Proterozoic ages
based on a few age dates from drill core. Stark (1997) observed that the Fort Wayne rift and
the ECRB contain a mafic basalt fill sequence on the north that is associated with the ECGH,
and a southern depocenter filled with Proterozoic clastic rocks and minor volcanic flows.
Baranoski et al. (2009) interpreted reprocessed data of COCORP line OH-1 (Figure 2.6) to
include reflectors that indicate the Grenville collision and an end to the phase of rift basin
subsidence.
               Note: Figure is from Baranoski et al. (2009).

The second major continental rift developed along the eastern margin of Laurentia after
emplacement of the Eastern Granite-Rhyolite province rocks. It consists of the arcuate
Midcontinent rift system (MRS) that extends from mid-Kansas to the Lake Superior region and
then southeast across Michigan (Figure 2.2 and Figure 2.8). The arcuate MRS is coincident
with the Midcontinent gravity high that extends from mid-Kansas to the Lake Superior region,
the Mid-Michigan gravity high, and possibly portions of the ECGH from Ohio to Tennessee
(Keller et al. 1983). The Midcontinent rift is interpreted as a relatively short-lived breakup of
Laurentia with syn-rift volcanic and mafic intrusive rocks extruded between about 1.109 and
1.087 Ga, and younger post-rift sedimentary rocks deposited about 1.1 – 1.0 Ga
(Van Schmus 1992).
      Note: Figure is from Easton and Carter (1995).

Cannon (1994) concludes that during compression, the southwest arm of the rift was closed
about 30 km, the central graben area in the Lake Superior region was inverted, and the

southeast arm was dominated by strike-slip faulting. These structural relationships are
documented in several deep seismic reflection profiles. COCORP lines MI-1, MI-2, and MI-3
(Figure 2.6), located in the center of the Michigan basin near the deep McClure-Sparks oil well,
are interpreted to show a south-dipping rotated block (Zhu and Brown 1986). On GLIMPCE
lines A, C, F the MRS can be recognized in the vicinity of Lake Superior (Behrendt 1988,
Cannon et al. 1989) (Figure 2.6). A segmented rift structure with inverted, normal-faulted
asymmetric half grabens separated by zones of accommodation (faults transverse to rift axis)
is interpreted by Cannon et al. (1989).
The relative ages of these two rifting events are uncertain. Drahovzal et al. (1992) observed
that the magnetic signature of the ECGH become less distinct east of the Grenville Front and
that east-dipping thrust sheets overlying Middle Run formation in Kentucky indicate that the
ECRB cannot be as young as Cambrian. The relative age of rifting in the ECRB could not be
assessed, however, because of the unclear overthrust relationship between the Grenville Front
and ECRB on COCORP line OH-1. Stark (1997) acknowledges that demonstrating an
association between the MRS and ECRB requires additional research to resolve the
inconsistent observations of basement lithology in northwestern Ohio. Baranoski et al. (2009)
examined sequence stratigraphy, structural relationships, and geopotential field data but were
unable to assess whether the Fort Wayne rift portion of the East Continent rift is coeval with
the southeastern arm of the Midcontinent rift in Michigan.
2.2.5     Grenville Province
The Grenville Orogeny records the assembly of the Neoproterozoic supercontinent, Rodinia
(Faill 1997a). The Grenville province consists of three general lithotectonic segments:
(1) Laurentia and its pre-Grenvillian margin; (2) the Composite Arc Belt (CAB); and (3) the
Frontenac-Adirondack Belt (Carr et al. 2000) (Figure 2.9). Laurentia and its pre-Grenvillian
margin (L2 rocks depicted on Figure 2.9b) contain rocks of the Archean Superior province,
Paleoproterozoic Southern province, and 1800 – 1350 Ma supracrustal and continental arc
rocks (L3 rocks depicted on Figure 2.9b) of the Central Gneiss Belt (CGB) (Figure 2.9a; White
et al. 2000). Widespread deformation, metamorphism, and magmatism recorded in these
rocks at 1740 and 1450 Ma are attributed to Andean-style continental arcs (White et al. 2000)
that may be related to Granite Rhyolite volcanism (Carr et al. 2000, Rivers and Corrigan 2000).
The CAB (Figure 2.9b) contains allocthonous 1300 – 1250 Ma volcanic, plutonic,
volcaniclastic, carbonate, and siliclastic rocks from various arcs, rifted arcs, and marginal
basins amalgamated offshore by 1,240 Ma (White et al. 2000). The Frontenac-Adirondack
Belt (Figure 2.9b) is composed of supracrustal rocks, orthogneiss assemblages, and
anorthosites and anorthosite-mangerite- charnockite-granite that formed in continental crust or
arc fragments and underwent granulite-amphibolite-facies deformation by 1170 Ma in a
tectonic setting offshore of the pre-Laurentian margin (White et al. 2000).
The Elzevir Orogeny sutured the CAB to the eastern margin of Laurentia between 1.3 and
1.2 Ga, recorded as collision, deformation, and high-grade metamorphism (Carr et al. 2000,
White et al. 2000). The Frontenac terrane and the Central Granulite Belt of the Adirondack
highlands were amalgamated with the CAB by 1165 Ma as a result of crustal imbrications and
stacking, forming the Central Metasedimentary Belt (CMB) (Figure 2.9a). Rocks of the CGB
were reworked during this assembly, resulting in lithotectonic domains that are bounded by
ductile shear zones assembled 1120 – 1040 Ma (White et al. 2000).

Rivers (1997) defined the collisional Sawingian phase from abundant anorthosite-mangerite-
charnockite-granite plutonism from 1.19 to 1.11 Ga. Whitmeyer and Karlstrom (2007) interpret
a quiescent period between the Elzevir and Ottawan orogenies that is characterized by
delamination and extensional collapse as a result of crustal thickening from plutonism. This
extension occurred within the CGB as ductile extension along the Shawanaga shear zone
(Figure 2.10) (White et al. 2000).

The 1.09 – 0.98 Ga Ottawan Orogeny renewed northwest-directed thrusting and imbrication of
terranes as a result of a major collision with either the Amazonia, Rio de la Plata, and/or
Kalahari cratons (Whitmeyer and Karlstrom 2007). These terranes were transported to the
northwest on thrust systems of the CMB and thrust over rocks of the pre-Grenvillian Laurentian
margin about 1120 – 980 Ma (some of these thrusts are exposed in the CGB). Domains of the
Composite Arc and Frontenac-Adirondack belts formed at middle to upper crustal levels during
the Grenvillian orogeny and exhibit complex fold geometry. Convergence between 1080 and
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                        - 18 -                                March 2011
1040 Ma consisted of northwest-directed thrusting that resulted in substantial telescoping and
thickening (White et al. 2000). Metamorphism peaked at 1.07 Ga and ended with
emplacement of 0.96 Ga plutons in the Green Mountains of Vermont
(Whitmeyer and Karlstrom 2007).
Post-orogenic denudation and cooling continued from 980 to 600 Ma (Carr et al. 2000) and
was, in part, accommodated by distributed ductile strain. This ductile strain occurred within the
CGB and on structures throughout the Grenville province, including the Grenville Front, the
Robertson Lake shear zone, and the Carthage-Colton mylonite zone (Figure 2.10)
(White et al. 2000). Postcollisional exhumation of overthickened crust may have uplifted rocks
of the southeast CGB by at least 15 km relative to the northeast CMB (White et al. 2000).
Exhumation of the Grenville Front was facilitated by partial melting and ductile flow due to high
temperatures that persisted throughout the late stages of the orogeny, ensuring that late-stage
normal or reverse faults would sole into the mid-crust (White et al. 2000).
Grenville-age terranes within the Appalachians have been interpreted as either rifted
fragments accreted during Appalachian tectonic events, far-traveled terranes from west of the
Granite Rhyolite province, or exotic terranes from West Africa or South America, which were
accreted during Appalachian tectonic events (Whitmeyer and Karlstrom 2007).
The Grenville crustal structure is characterized by north-northeast-striking, relatively shallow
east-southeast-dipping ductile thrust faults that developed at mid- to lower crustal depths
during the Middle Proterozoic Grenville Orogeny (Green et al. 1988, Milkereit et al. 1992,
Forsyth et al. 1994a, 1994b, Zelt et al. 1994). The following discussion characterizes
important structural boundaries, including the Grenville Front tectonic zone, the Central
Metasedimentary Belt boundary zone (CMBBZ), and the Composite Arc Belt boundary zone
(CABBZ) (Figure 2.9a and 2.9b).
2.2.5.1    Grenville Front
In eastern Canada, the Grenville Front separates the Archean Superior province (more than
2.5 Ga) from much younger rocks of the Grenville Orogen (1.6 – 1.0 Ga) (Thurston 1992a).
The Grenville Front tectonic zone (GFTZ) defines the northwest boundary of the Grenville
province and extends through North America for approximately 1900 km. The GFTZ is
interpreted from seismic reflection profiles: COCORP lines OH-1 and OH-2 in central Ohio
(Pratt et al. 1989, Culotta et al. 1990) and GLIMPCE lines I and J in Lake Huron
(Green et al. 1988, Mereu et al. 1990) (Figure 2.6). Green et al. (1988) interpreted the GFTZ
as a 32 km wide, steeply dipping zone of east-dipping reflectors. After reprocessing these
data, Mereu et al. (1990) interpreted these reflectors as mylonite zones associated with ductile
faulting. Pratt et al. (1989) interpreted east-dipping parallel reflectors as the GFTZ in Ohio.
Culotta et al. (1990) later synthesized these results and interpreted the GFTZ as a 50 km wide,
25- to 30-degree east-dipping zone penetrating to 25 km deep, attributing the west-dipping
reflectors to the CMBBZ.
The location of the GFTZ has been interpreted in several alternative positions. In Michigan,
Hinze et al. (1975) (Figure 2.11) interpreted areas of positive northeast-southwest-trending
gravity and magnetic anomalies as characteristic of the Grenville province, consistent with the
trend of anomalies of exposed Grenville province rocks in Ontario. In Ohio, Lucius and von
Frese (1988) placed the GFTZ west of the Anorthosite Complex anomaly based on their model
that this anomaly was uplifted from the deep crust during the Grenville orogeny. In a regional
study, Atekwana (1996) characterized the Grenville province as having higher-amplitude and
higher-frequency magnetic anomalies that trend northwest to north in Kentucky, Ohio, and

southeastern Michigan, as well as north-northeast in southwestern Ontario.
Easton and Carter (1995) interpreted the location of the GFTZ (Figure 2.8 and Figure 2.12) by
combining seismic reflection profile data from COCORP lines OH-1 and GLIMPCE line J with
drillhole data in southwestern Ontario.
                 Note: Figure is from Hinze et al. (1975).
          Figure 2.11: Basement Province Map of Southern Peninsula of Michigan
Easton and Carter (1995) identified lithotectonic domains within the basement of Ontario from
aeromagnetic and gravity anomalies, drill core samples of basement rock, and seismic
reflection profiles (Figure 2.12). In their interpretation, the GFTZ (Figure 2.8) is located east of
the Killarney Magmatic Belt and extends to the south along the Detroit River through Michigan,
consistent with the interpretation of geophysical anomalies by Lucius and von Freese (1988).
Easton and Carter (1995) define a location of the GFTZ that is to the east of the location
Hinze et al. (1975) interpreted in southeastern Michigan. Easton and Carter (1995) also
considered the structural relationship between the Midcontinent rift and the Grenville Front.
They observed that west to northwest-trending linear aeromagnetic anomalies of the Essex

domain (Figure 2.12) are along the strike of the east-trending gravity high of the Midcontinent
rift in southeastern Michigan (Figure 2.11). Based on this information, Easton and Carter
(1995) interpreted the Essex domain as either the metamorphosed fill rocks of the
Midcontinent rift or, alternatively, as the eastern end of the rift overlain by Grenville thrust
sheets.

2.2.5.2     Central Metasedimentary Belt Boundary Zone

terrane and the CMBBZ as the tectonized boundary between the CMB and the CGB (Figure
2.9). This tectonic zone is at least 30 km wide (up to 50 km wide surface expression); has an
apparent southeast dip of 20 degrees in the Bancroft terrane, increasing to as steep as
40 degrees toward the CGB; and extends to at least 25 km in depth (White et al. 1994). This
broad zone of ductile deformation and crustal stacking that characterize the CMBBZ, the
Bancroft terrane, and their CGB footwall is interpreted as resulting from northwest-directed
thrusting during the Ottawan Orogeny (1080 – 1040 Ma) (White et al. 2000). This structure
overlies a wedge-shaped lower crustal zone that could have acted as a crustal wedge during
the collision of the CMB and CGB, delaminating the CMB crust, or it could be autochtonous
basement of the CGB underlying the allochthonous thrust sheets of the CMB
(White et al. 1994).
A velocity culmination lies within the footwall of the CMBBZ, indicating that the CMBBZ is
adjacent to velocity uplifts that suggest bulk relative upward transport of mid-crustal rocks
across these zones (White et al. 2000). Carr et al. (2000) conclude that rocks of the CMBBZ
and Bancroft terrane may have originated on the distal margin of pre-Grenvillian Laurentia, or
they are allochthonous and were part of the CAB.
Seismic images interpreted by Milkereit et al. (1992) of the CMBBZ in Lakes Erie and Ontario
provide evidence for ductile faults bounding imbricate thrust sheets on the western side of the
boundary. The most western of the reflections maintains an approximately 30-degree easterly
dip from beneath the Paleozoic cover to approximately 10 km depth, and flattens into a
decollement extending to approximately 22 km depth. Many of the planar and listric reflections
east of the CMBBZ border large-scale curvilinear reflection bands interpreted as either a
sequence of folds successively truncated by later east-dipping faults or a sequence of ramp
folds. Evidence of reactivation, either by late-phase Grenville extension or pre-Appalachian
rifting, resulted in a local fault-bounded half graben in the eastern portion of the CMBBZ.
Milkereit et al. (1992) attribute the formation of this basin to reversal of former thrust faults;
they note that the top of the Trenton Group (Middle Ordovician) is not significantly deformed by
this reactivated thrust fault.
Milkereit et al. (1992) interpolated the location of the CMBBZ between its location in Lakes
Ontario and Erie and outcrops imaged by Lithoprobe lines 31 and 32 (Figure 2.6) using
aeromagnetic data. The boundary is defined by higher amplitudes of magnetic anomalies along
the western boundary of the CGB compared to lower values of the CMB. Subsequent work by
Forsyth et al. (1994b) confirms that magnetic anomalies in west-central Lake Ontario coincide
with a west-to-east, positive-to-negative change in the magnetic field. This transition coincides
with a zone of east-dipping reflectors extrapolated from the end of the seismic section to beneath
Lake Ontario. In the subsurface of Lake Erie, the CMBBZ also correlates with a change in
magnetic signature from higher values west of the CMBBZ to lower values over the CMBBZ. On
that basis, Forsyth et al. (1994a) traced the CMBBZ between Lakes Erie and Ontario (Figure
2.13).
Seismic data from line 4 (Figure 2.6) illustrates the complications in crustal geometry
(O’Dowd et al. 2004). The CMBBZ consists of southeast-dipping reflections that truncate or
overprint a subhorizontal band at approximately 21 km in depth. O’Dowd et al. (2004)
performed cross-tip analysis and determined that reflectors of the CMBBZ have a strike of
N13E and dip 25 degrees to the southeast. The deeper reflections have a strike of N65E and
dip 20 degrees to the southeast. Comparing these results to recent aeromagnetic data,
O’Dowd et al. (2004) revised the subsurface trace of the CMBBZ along the western edge of
the Mississauga domain (Figure 2.15).

The structural style west of the CMBBZ changes significantly in Lake Erie.
Forsyth et al. (1994b) observe westerly dipping mid-crustal reflections below and to the west of
the CMBBZ. West-dipping mid- to deep crustal reflectors west of the CMBBZ were also
observed in COCORP line OH-2 (Pratt et al. 1989) (Figure 2.6). Ouassaa et al. (2002)
observed a change from east-dipping to west- or northwest-dipping reflectors in the center of
line 6 (Figure 2.6). Hoehn (1991) reprocessed the seismic data from Lake Erie and interpreted
the Akron Magnetic Boundary as a major suture within the Grenville province that separates
east-dipping upper and middle crustal reflectors in the west from west-dipping mid-crustal
reflectors in the east. Hoehn (1991) uses the terminology of Lidiak and Hinze
(see Rankinet al. 1993) (Figure 2.14) and defines the Akron Magnetic Boundary as the eastern
boundary of the eastern Midcontinent Magnetic Belt, a basement province between the CGB
and CMB in the subsurface of Ohio and Lake Erie.

2.2.5.3     Composite Arc Belt Boundary Zone
The CABBZ (Ouassaa and Forsyth 2002) (Figure 2.16), also called the Elzevirian-Frontenac
boundary zone (White et al. 2000), corresponds to the Sharbot Lake domain of
Carr et al. (2000), who interpreted it as a rift arc. Continuation of the CABBZ into New York
may correspond to the Clarendon-Linden fault system (Ouassaa and Forsyth 2002).
White et al. (2000) estimated that these three structures (the GFTZ, CMBBZ, and CABBZ)
accommodated approximately 15 km of structural relief, as shown on deep seismic reflection
profiles. Prominent north-northeast-trending geophysical anomalies associated with exposed
Grenville structures extend southward beyond the Canadian Shield and beneath the
unconformable lower Paleozoic cover rocks. Regional geologic maps (e.g., Ontario Geological
Survey 1991) indicate that the overlying Paleozoic rocks are, with few exceptions, relatively
flat-lying and laterally continuous, indicating that no large-scale major faulting has occurred in
the region since they were deposited.

2.2.6    St. Lawrence Rift System
Crustal extension and rifting late in the Neoproterozoic and into the earliest Cambrian
separated the Neoproterozoic supercontinent Rodina into East Gondwana, West Gondwana,
and Laurentia (Figure 2.17) (Faill 1997a). In the study region, this rifting event resulted in the
development of the St. Lawrence rift system (SLRS). The breakup of Rodinia spanned
approximately 200 million years, with separation of East Gondwana from western Laurentia
approximately 750 million years ago and rifting of eastern Laurentia from West Gondwana

resulting in the opening of several intervening oceans2 (Figure 2.17) (Faill 1997a). A mantle
plume initiated Iaptan rifting along the Sutton Mountain triple junction (Kumarapeli 1985) that
resulted in the development of the St. Lawrence valley system and aulocogens of the
Ottawa-Bonnechere and Saguenay grabens (Kumarapeli and Saull 1966;
Kumarapeli 1985, 1993).

            Figure 2.17: Reconstruction of Rodinia at the End of the Neoproterozoic
Based on geochronological studies of the Sutton Mountain volcanics, Kumarapeli (1993)
established the following sequence: rifting initiated at 590 Ma and continued for
35 million years; rifting ceased about 554 Ma after an outburst of alkaline to transitional basalts
at the Sutton Mountain triple junction; a period of rift-facies clastic sedimentation followed until
the rift-drift transition at 550 Ma. Kamo et al. (1995) confirmed that the Grenville dike swarm of
the Ottawa graben is coeval with Sutton Mountain volcanism (500 Ma), implying that this
swarm was emplaced within a relatively short time span at the onset of rifting. Major and trace
element studies of the rocks confirm a mantle source consistent with plume activity
(St. Seymour and Kumarapeli 1995, Abdel-Rahman and Kumarapeli 1998). Puffer (2002)

  The Iapetus Ocean was initially defined as the early Paleozoic ocean between Baltica and Laurentia (Greenland); the Theic
Ocean was defined as the ocean between Laurentia and Gondwana; and the Rheic Ocean between Baltica and Gondwana
(Figure 2.17). Faill (1997) emphasizes that the subsequent universal usage of Iapetus refers to the Paleozoic ocean off the
Laurentia east margin and that sensu stricto the Iapetus Ocean was closed in the late Silurian Caledonia orogeny during the
docking of Avalonia microcontinents with Laurentia. The remaining ocean that lay east of Avalonia is generally called Theic,
leading Faill (1997) to recognize the Paleozoic ocean east of Laurentia as Theia. This discussion uses the terminology Iapetus as
given by the authors cited, recognizing the distinction between these three Paleozoic oceans.
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                            - 27 -                          March 2011
compiled a database of high field-strength elements for Late Neoproterozoic to early Paleozoic
flood basalts revealing that super plume activity peaked at 550 Ma at the Sutton Mountain
triple junction.
The SLRS comprises abundant large-scale normal faults displacing lower Paleozoic strata and
underlying Grenville basement on the order of many hundreds of meters along the Ottawa,
Champlain, St. Lawrence, and Saguenay river valleys (Figure 2.18)
(Kumarapeli and Saull 1966). These extensional faults generally cut discordantly across
Grenville-aged structures instead of reactivating them. The rift structures include zones of
en-echelon faults parallel to the ancient margin, possible fracture zones transverse to the
ancient margin, and two well-defined aulacogens (failed rifts)—the Ottawa and Saguenay
grabens (fault-bounded troughs). The north-northeast-trending faults along both the
Champlain and St. Lawrence river valleys, once attributed to a two-sided failed intracontinental
rift, are now recognized as part of the southeast-facing Iapetan margin (Wheeler 1996a).
  Note: Figure modified from Kumarapeli and Saull (1966)
                        Figure 2.18: Rift Zones of the St. Lawrence System
The SLRS provides evidence for multiple phases of reactivation. The St. Lawrence fault
crosses the Devonian Charlevoix impact crater (Figure 2.19) without major deflection,
suggesting post-impact reactivation (Lemieux et al. 2003). Faults within the Ottawa graben
show three phases of reactivation consistent with the closure of the Iapetus Ocean,
emplacement of Cretaceous dikes, and the post-Cretaceous stress field of North America
(Rimando and Benn 2005). Faults in the southern portion of the rift provide evidence for
northwest-southeast extension associated with the opening of the Iapetus Ocean;
west-northwest/east-southeast compressions followed by minor north-northwest
compressional events are associated with Appalachian thrusting; and, northeast-southwest

and north-northwest/south-southeast extension is associated with the opening of the
Atlantic-Labrador Ocean. Northeast-southwest compression postdates these events
(Rocher et al. 2003).

2.2.7     Intracratonic Basins
The four main Paleozoic structural units within the study region are the Michigan and
Appalachian basins and the northwest-southeast-trending Algonquin and Findlay arches,
which separate the basins (Figure 2.3). These structural features are present on structure
contour maps of the Precambrian basement as subtle, contiguous features with a regional dip
of less than one degree (Brigham 1971). The Michigan Basin is visible on these contours as a
smooth, arcuate pattern, whereas contours within the Appalachian Basin have a triangular
pattern (Brigham 1971).
The Michigan Basin is a circular intracratonic basin that subsided and was filled with marine
sediments during the Paleozoic. These sediments dip gently toward the center of the basin
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                       - 29 -                                March 2011
and away from the Algonquin arch (Sanford 1993). The Michigan Basin contains 4900 m of
Paleozoic sedimentary rocks and at least 1500 m of Precambrian sedimentary rocks
associated with the southeast arm of the Midcontinent rift system. Rifting was followed by
thermal subsidence at 520 Ma, leading to an embryonic form of the Michigan Basin as a sag
basin. Major subsidence began in the early Ordovician when the configuration as a circular
basin was attained. The main structural grain of the basin is oriented northwest-southeast and
is characterized by Paleozoic anticlines. The basin is tilted slightly asymmetrically to the north
(Catacosinos et al. 1991).
The Appalachian Basin is elongate and sharply truncated by the Appalachian structural front to
the east and attains a maximum depth of approximately 1100 m. Dips into the Appalachian
Basin became steeper in the Late Ordovician and again in the Late Devonian (Brigham 1971).
The Appalachian Basin formed as a single elongate basin in response to the Ordovician
Taconic orogeny (Faill 1997a). By the Late Ordovician, orogenic activity confined the
Appalachian Basin to its present geometry (Sanford 1993).
The northeast-trending, northeast-plunging Findlay Arch in western Ohio and southeast
Michigan, and the northeast-trending, southwest-plunging Algonquin Arch in Canada separate
the Michigan and Appalachian basins. The Findlay and Algonquin arches are part of the same
feature, which was present in the Precambrian and remained a passive, positive feature as
flanking basins settled. The present-day Findlay-Algonquin arch structure developed during
episodes of subsidence that alternated on opposite sides of the arches. The axis of these
arches migrated southeastward in response to encroachment of the Michigan Basin. The
Findlay and Algonquin arches influenced Paleozoic sedimentary deposition into the Middle
Devonian (Brigham 1971).
The Chatham Sag was formed by the mutual plunges of the Findlay and Algonquin arches and
is first indicated in the Ordovician Trenton and Black River formations (Brigham 1971). The
Chatham Sag is one of several major inlets into the Michigan Basin. This east-west-trending
structure did not have a significant influence on sedimentation until the Late Silurian. The
northern margin of the Chatham Sag is defined by the east-west-trending Electric fault
(Brigham 1971), which deflects the nose of the Algonquin Arch to the west (see Section 2.4).
2.2.8      Penobscot Orogeny
Late Cambrian–Middle Ordovician Penobscottian orogeny amalgamated composite terranes
within arcs of the Iapetus Ocean (Murphy and Keppie 2005) and therefore did not result in
deformation within Laurentia. This tectonic event corresponds to low subsidence rates
(Howell and van der Pluijm 1990) within a trough-shaped Michigan Basin
(Howell and van der Pluijm 1999). These terranes were accreted to the Laurentian margin
during the Taconic Orogeny (Moench and Aleinikoff 2003).
2.2.9      Taconic Orogeny
Magmatic arcs that developed in the Late Cambrian within the Theic Ocean were obducted to
the Laurentian margin during the Middle to Late Ordovician Taconic Orogeny (Faill 1997a,
Moench and Aleinikoff 2003). This widespread tectonic event occurred from Labrador to
Alabama and is currently exposed in the southern Appalachians in the Piedmont and Great
Valley allochthons and in western New England (Figure 2.20). Assemblages in the southern
Appalachians contain complexes assembled in the Theic Ocean, whereas assemblages of
western New England consist of two magmatic arcs: the Halwey arc of the Brompton-Cameron
terrane and the Ammonoosuc arc of the Central Maine terrane (Faill 1997a). These arcs
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                      - 30 -                                 March 2011
developed from multiple accretionary events with changing polarity shortly before the closure
of the Iapetus Ocean at 460 Ma (Moench and Aleinikoff 2003). This deformation produced
north-south- to northeast-southwest-trending reverse conjugated brittle faults under a pure
compressional stress regime late in the development of the orogeny (Faure et al. 2004). This
Taconic compressional event also resulted in reactivation of Iapetan faults in the St. Lawrence
lowlands as east-northeast/west-southwest dextral and northwest-southeast sinistral faults
(Rocher et al. 2003, Faure et al. 2004). The Appalachian Basin developed in response to the
Taconic orogeny and was expressed as a single elongate basin from Alabama to at least
Quebec (Faill 1997b). The Michigan Basin experienced renewed subsidence
(Howell and van der Pluijm 1990) and transitioned from basin-centered to eastward tilting
(Howell and van der Pluijm 1999).
2.2.10    Salinic Orogeny
Late Ordovician-Silurian Salinic Orogeny accreted the Gander, Avalon, Nashoba, and Carolina
terranes to Laurentia during the closure of the Iapetus Ocean during the Laurentia-Avalonia
collision (Murphy and Keppie 2005). Silurian metamorphism (430-410 Ma) in the Northern
Appalachians is attributed to retrograde metamorphism following the main compression event
(Tremblay and Castonguay 2002). The event involved southeast-directed transport of
Taconian crustal wedge followed by normal faulting (Saint-Joseph and Baie Verte-Brompton
faults) and development of the fault-bounded sedimentary basins of the Connecticut
Valley-Gaspé Trough (Tremblay and Castonguay 2002). Tremblay and Pinet (2005) attribute
the late-stage extension to supracrustal extensional collapse due to late-stage delamination of
the lithospheric mantle in a southeast-dipping subduction zone. Subsidence rates in the
Michigan Basin are consistent with that of the Taconic Orogeny
(Howell and van der Pluijm 1990) and correspond to a transition from eastward tilting to basin-
centered morphology (Howell and van der Pluijm 1999).
2.2.11    Acadian Orogeny
The Devonian Acadian Orogeny has been attributed to either the collision of Avalonia with
Laurentia or the accretion of the Meguma terrane; however, recent work indicates that the
Meguma terrane is the passive margin on the southern margin of Avalonia
(Murphy and Keppie 2005). Murphy and Keppie (2005) interpreted the Acadian Orogeny as
forming along an Andean-type margin that possibly overrides a plume and swell. Acadian
metamorphism is well dated as 385 – 375 Ma in the southern part of the Dunnage zone
(Tremblay et al. 2000). Deformation from the Acadian Orogeny is expressed as
east-southeast/west-northwest compression in a transpressional regime producing
east-northeast/west-northwest dextral and northwest-southeast sinistral strike-slip faults that
crosscut Taconian thrust faults in the Appalachians of Quebec and New Brunswick
(Faure et al. 2004). This deformation also resulted in reactivation of Iapetan structures in the
St. Lawrence lowlands (Faure et al. 2004, Rocher et al. 2003). The Acadian Orogeny is
expressed in the Appalachian Basin as siliclastic sedimentation from the Middle to Late
Devonian (Faill 1997b), with additional pulses of uplift occurring in the Early and Late
Carboniferous. The morphology of the Michigan Basin transitioned from narrow
basin-centered in the Early to Middle Devonian to broad basin-centered in the late Middle
Devonian, and eastward tilting in the Late Devonian and Carboniferous
(Howell and van der Pluijm 1999).

2.2.12     Charlevoix Impact Crater
The Devonian Charlevoix impact crater is located on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River
100 km northeast of Quebec (Lemieux et al. 2003). The Devonian age is established from
321 and 372 Ma K-Ar dates on impact melt and breccia (Tremblay et al. 2003). The
St. Lawrence fault crosses the Charlevoix impact crater without major trend deflection or fault
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                        - 32 -                                 March 2011
offsets within or at the boundaries of the Devonian impact structure (Figure 2.19). This
observation suggests that impact-related faults did not significantly alter the orientation of
pre-existing structures and that at least one episode of reactivation is younger than the impact
structure, most probably concurrent with the opening of the Atlantic Ocean in the Mesozoic
(Tremblay and Lemieux 2001, Lemieux et al. 2003).
2.2.13    Alleghenian Orogeny
There is general consensus that the Late Carboniferous–Permian Allegheny Orogeny was due
to terminal collision between Gondwana and Laurentia-Baltica that closed the Rheic Ocean
and resulted in the formation of Pangea (Murphy and Keppie 2005). The Alleghenian Orogeny
produced decollement tectonism in the central and southern Appalachians along with early
penetrative shortening, late low-angle thrusts, low-grade metamorphism, and transpressional
shear zones. The northern Appalachians exhibit relatively high-grade metamorphism of
Taconic and Acadian crust and deformation of Appalachian deposits near the Hudson Valley
(Faill 1998). Brittle faults of the northern Appalachians exhibit three phases of compression:
an early north-northwest/south-southeast compression, a north-northeast/south-southwest
compression, and a late west-northwest/east-southeast compression (Faure et al. 1996a).
2.2.14    Opening of the Atlantic
Mesozoic rifting resulted in the breakup of Pangea. This rifting is associated with the
separation of the North American and African plates and produced rift basins along the Atlantic
seaboard that are situated landward of the hinge zone of the continental margin. This
landward region experienced considerably less crustal thinning than did the region seaward of
the hinge zone that includes the deeper marginal sedimentary basins (Klitgord et al. 1988).
Faure et al. (2006) identified two phases of extension: an initial Late Triassic east-west
extension related to the formation of rift basins in the Bay of Fundy and South Georgia and
Early Jurassic east-southeast/west-northwest extension related to the central Atlantic rift
system.
2.2.15    Cretaceous Volcanism and Extension
Cretaceous volcanism in eastern Canada and New England has been attributed either to
intrusions along pre-existing zones of weakness (McHone 1996) or movement of the Great
Meteor hotspot track (Crough 1981, Sleep 1990) beneath eastern North America.
Evidence for the hotspot consists of an alignment of mapped alkalic intrusions from the
Monteregian Hills of Quebec to the Cretaceous seamounts of offshore New England
(Zartman 1977). Morgan (1983) attributed the age distribution of these rocks to two hotspot
tracks passing through New England at different times: the Verde hotspot track at 160 Ma and
the Meteor hotspot at about 120 Ma. Duncan (1984) observed that radiometric ages for
dredged volcanic rocks from seven of the New England seamounts increase in age from the
southeast (82 Ma for the Nashville Seamount) to the northwest (103 Ma for the Bear
Seamount). Subsequent mapping by Heaman and Kjarsgaard (2000) extended the Great
Meteor hotspot track to the Rankin Inlet on the west side of James Bay by observing four
periods of kimberlite magmatism along a northwest-southeast trend to Timiskaming.
After reviewing petrologic data, McHone (1996) observed that although a plume model fits the
petrologic data, it does not fit the geographic age distribution of igneous activity. McHone (1996)
concluded that lithospheric processes were necessary to start and stop the generations of

magma from the same source in the mantle, and he proposed that heterogeneous source areas
coupled with tectonic reactivation of crustal structures could explain the distribution of these
rocks. Results of a paleostress analysis of brittle faults in the Quebec Appalachians provide
evidence for two distinct phases of Cretaceous extension: an initial geographically widespread
northeast-southwest phase of extension and a later north-south phase of extension confined to
southern Quebec (Faure et al. 1996b). Faure et al. (1996b) attributed this Cretaceous volcanism
to continued fragmentation of Pangea. Early northeast- to east-northeast-oriented extension and
associated magmatism between 140 and 90 Ma are correlated to rifting between Labrador and
Greenland at approximately 140 Ma, to early breakup stages of the South Atlantic Ocean at
130 Ma, and to north-south-oriented extension and emplacement of dikes at 125 Ma,
corresponding to the separation of Iberia from Newfoundland (Faure et al. 1996b).
Crough (1981) suggests that the passage of the hotspot caused a 600 km wide zone of
epeirogeny in southeastern Canada and New England, resulting in erosion of at least 1 km in
Montreal and as much as 6 to 7 km in New England. Recent thermochronology studies
provide evidence for Late Cretaceous reactivation. Roden-Tice et al. (2000) see evidence for
two periods of unroofing of the Adirondack Mountains from apatite fission track dating: Late
Jurassic to Early Cretaceous (160 – 120 Ma) throughout the region and Early to Late
Cretaceous (~110 – 80 Ma) in the southeast that must be explained by tectonic denudation
processes. Roden-Tice (2000) support the hypothesis that this Early to Late Cretaceous uplift,
contemporaneous with intrusion of the Monteregian Hills plutons, can be attributed to
differential unroofing resulting from reverse reactivation of east-dipping normal faults.
Similar uplift ages were observed for the Hartford basin of Massachusetts and Connecticut,
indicating that the basin is Cretaceous in age, not early Mesozoic
(Roden-Tice and Wintsch 2002). Apatite fission track ages across the Norembega fault zone
in southern coastal Maine reveal a 30 – 50-million-year discontinuity, suggesting that this fault
shows 2 km of vertical offset in the Late Cretaceous (West and Roden-Tice 2003).
Roden-Tice and Tice (2005) attribute the widespread unroofing during the Middle Jurassic to
Late Cretaceous, accommodated by northwest-southeast extensional reactivation of faults in
the Adirondacks and New Hampshire, to remnant heating from the Great Meteor hotspot track.
A remnant thermal anomaly is inferred to exist in the upper mantle and lower lithosphere,
based on several geophysical studies. Travel-time inversions of teleseismic results from
southern Ontario image a low-velocity corridor between 50 and 300 km that crosscuts regional
structures of the Grenville province and Ottawa-Bonnechere graben (Rondenay et al. 2000).
These results are attributed to a zone of contrasting thermal-compositional-anisotropic
properties related to the Great Meteor hotspot (Rondenay et al. 2000). Subsequent work by
Li et al. (2003) confirms the presence of a broad low-velocity layer in the upper mantle and
attributes it to the Cretaceous hotspot. Crustal thickness and average VP/VS ratio maps for
the area derived from teleseismic receiver functions illustrate thin crust northeast of the
Ottawa-Bonnechere graben coincident with the Western Quebec seismic zone
(Eaton et al. 2006).

2.3       Contemporary Stress and Neotectonic Setting
Southeastern Canada is included in a broad midplate compressive stress province that includes
most of the central and eastern United States and possibly much of the western North Atlantic
basin to within about 250 km of the mid-Atlantic ridge (Zoback et al. 1986). The stress field
throughout this region is characterized by a nearly horizontal, northeast- through east-striking
axis of maximum compressive stress (Zoback and Zoback 1991). The overall uniformity in the
direction and relative magnitude of the midplate stress pattern suggests a far-field tectonic
source, and ridge-push (due to accretion of oceanic crust along the mid-Atlantic ridge) is
preferred over basal drag as the primary source of stress in the midplate region
(Zoback and Zoback 1991).
Most earthquakes in this midplate stress province have strike-slip, oblique-reverse, or reverse
fault mechanisms. Well-constrained focal mechanisms for earthquakes that have occurred in
eastern North America in the past 25 years indicate primarily thrust (reverse) fault and/or
strike-slip events (see, e.g., Zoback 1992, Adams and Bell 1991). Northwest- and
northeast-trending faults are most favourably oriented for reactivation by reverse and/or
strike-slip displacement, according to recent interpretations of the orientations of the
contemporary regional stress components (Zoback 1992, Adams and Bell 1991, Adams 1995).
Reverse faulting on planes striking other than northeast and northwest, however, is not
precluded (Adams 1995). Equivocal evidence from within the seismogenic crust suggests that
stress orientations may change with depth: shallower earthquakes (less than 10 km) tend to be
more consistent with east-northeast compression, whereas deeper events tend to be less
consistent (Adams and Bell 1991). The available data from eastern Canada indicate that
deviatoric stresses throughout the shield generally exceed those necessary to generate
earthquakes (Adams 1995). However, there is no evidence to suggest that particular regions
are more likely to generate earthquakes based on the stress indicators (Adams 1995).
The seismicity of the Southern Great Lakes region has been studied in detail by
Dineva et al. (2004) and Ma and Atkinson (2006). Dineva et al. (2004) relocated hypocenters
from 106 earthquakes occurring during the period from 1990 to 2001 and identified several
earthquake clusters. They report that these seismicity zones appear to correlate with areas
where the regional magnetic data exhibit linear anomalies. According to Dineva et al. (2004),
the proximity of the earthquake clusters to large bodies of water and the association with
magnetic anomalies suggest that both surface water and pre-existing basement structures
may play significant roles in controlling the occurrence of the seismicity. Ma and
Atkinson (2006) analyzed focal depths for small-to-moderate earthquakes (MN ≥ 2.8) occurring
from 1980 to 2004 in southern Ontario and northern New York. They found that virtually all of
the earthquakes in the Lake Ontario region occurred with focal depths shallower than 8 km.
Adams and Basham (1991) have reported that most large historical and instrumental
earthquakes in eastern Canada have occurred near Paleozoic or younger rift zones. This is
similar to stable continental region earthquakes worldwide (Johnston et al. 1994). The Early
Paleozoic SLRS, which is delineated by a persistent pattern of seismicity, is the postulated
source of numerous large historical earthquakes in southeastern Canada
(Adams and Basham 1991). Seismicity along this rift system is concentrated in a number of
well-defined clusters, including the Ottawa River, Charlevoix, and lower St. Lawrence River
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                       - 35 -                                 March 2011
seismic zones, which are all separated by relatively aseismic regions. Fault slip in response to
the current tectonic stress regime on pre-existing structures associated with the SLRS is
believed to be the causal mechanism of this seismic activity (Adams and Bell 1991, Anglin 1984,
Forsyth 1981). Focal mechanisms from historical earthquakes within these seismic zones
indicate mainly thrust events occurring at depths of 5 to 25 km within the Grenville basement
(Adams and Basham 1991).
The postulated northwestern boundary of the Late Proterozoic/Early Paleozoic Iapetan rifted
margin (IRM) tectonic province is interpreted as the cratonward limit of large normal faults in
the Iapetan passive margin that have some long-term potential for reactivation in the present
compressional tectonic regime (Wheeler 1995). Wheeler (1995) has suggested that the
Clarendon-Linden fault system (Figure 2.21) forms a segment of this western boundary. It is
not known, however, whether normal slip congruent with Iapetan rifting occurred on this
structure during the Late Proterozoic to Cambrian, and thus it cannot be defined unequivocally
as an Iapetan structure (Wheeler 1996a). There is also deep seismic evidence suggesting that
the western boundary of the Iapetan margin may lie farther to the west, along the Central
CMBBZ (Figure 2.21) of the Grenville province (Milkereit et al. 1992). However, the thickness
(approximately 43 km) and structure of Precambrian crust in this region do not suggest
significant Iapetan extension (Forsyth et al. 1994a, b; Zelt et al. 1994).
The eastern boundary of the IRM is defined by a zone of intense thinning that separates highly
attenuated Grenville crust to the southeast from extended but relatively intact crust to the
northwest containing large Iapetan normal faults (Wheeler 1996b). Compressional reactivation
of Iapetan normal faults is thought to play an important role in the seismic behaviour of eastern
North America (e.g., the Charlevoix, Giles County, and Eastern Tennessee seismic zones)
(See: Adams and Basham 1991, Johnston et al. 1985, Powell et al. 1994, Wheeler 1995).
West of the IRM lies the Precambrian Central Craton (Wheeler and Johnston 1992), which is
composed of relatively flat-lying, Paleozoic platform sediments, overlying non-extended
basement crust of the Grenville and Eastern Granite-Rhyolite provinces (Bickford et al. 1986,
Van Schmus et al. 1996, Figure 2.2 and Figure 2.5). The rate of historical seismic activity in
this region is low and appears typical of stable cratonic crust (Johnston et al. 1994). In
general, seismic activity and the geologic conditions most associated with earthquake activity
in the stable continental region of central and eastern North America increase toward the east,
away from the Precambrian central craton and toward the rifted passive continental margin.
A neotectonic investigation of the Bruce nuclear site was conducted by Slattery (2011). The
purpose of the investigation was to examine Quaternary deposits to look for evidence of
paleoseismicity within a 50 km zone surrounding the Bruce site. Aerial photo interpretation,
including examination of high resolution light detection and ranging (LiDAR) imagery, was used
to assess the occurrence of neotectonic features and/or landforms. Potentially significant
features were examined in detail through field-based inspection. Features observed, including
offset beach ridges and contorted sedimentary bedding, were assessed to be a result of
anthropomorphic, glacial, or syndepositional origin and not to be a result of neotectonic
activity. No evidence of paleoliquefaction features or evidence of active faulting was observed
within the area investigated.

2.3.1     Glacial Adjustments
Postglacial rebound or glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) is the response of the solid earth to
changing surface loads brought on by the waxing and waning of large-scale ice sheets and
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                        - 37 -                                  March 2011
glaciers. Tilting of relic lake shorelines, changes to modern lake levels, changes to surface
gravity observations and secular movements (slow, systematic, persistent crustal motion over
time) are manifestations of land uplift and subsidence brought about by GIA (Sella et al. 2007).
GIA is also suspected as a cause of deformation within continental plates and may be a trigger
of seismicity in eastern North America (Wu and Johnston 2000, Mazzotti and Adams 2005).
Late Cenozoic crustal deformation related to glacial processes is recognized in the southern
Ontario region. The Laurentide ice sheet was the last of several great ice sheets to cover
parts of Ontario during the Quaternary period (Barnett 1992). Differential uplift and tilting of the
entire Lake Ontario basin has been attributed to postglacial isostatic rebound related to the
removal of the Laurentide ice sheet (Martini and Bowlby 1991). A review of GIA and the
implications for glacially induced faulting and nuclear repositories was recently published
(Lund and Naslund 2009), in which the authors describe observations and numerical models
used to study various aspects of these phenomena. Glacially induced faulting has been
recorded almost exclusively in regions of low to moderate seismicity, generally where there
has been no evidence of surface rupture during historical time, and all examples have involved
reactivation of existing faults and fractures. Almost all of the large (i.e., kilometre-scale) faults
generally accepted currently as being glacially induced are located in northern Fennoscandia
(i.e., the region of Finland, Sweden, and Norway). Lund and Naslund (2009) state that current
models of the process of faulting due to GIA are not mature enough to accurately predict the
location and magnitude of future faulting events. They note that efforts are underway to
include more complex processes in the faulting models, such as poroelastic effects,
strain-release effects and local geological conditions.
The rates and uncertainties on seismic moment and deformation in eastern Canada, including
a comparison of seismic strain rates with GIA predictions for the region, are described by
Mazzotti and Adams (2005). They note that the differences between estimated
rebound-induced strain rates and seismic strain rates suggests that only a very small
percentage of the elastic GIA deformation leaks into plastic deformation to produce
earthquakes. They also state that while models of GIA adjustments can in theory be used to
predict three-dimensional velocity, strain and stress fields in the lithosphere, in practice the
models are quite sensitive to the model inputs (e.g., ice load history, ambient tectonic stress,
viscosity of the mantle), leading to significant variations in results.
Recent observations of GIA from global positioning system (GPS) velocity field data indicate
that the hinge line marking the approximate boundary between regions of vertical rebound to
the north and subsidence to the south in eastern North America lies close to the Bruce nuclear
site (Sella et al. 2007). The residual velocity field indicates subsidence (1 to 2 mm/yr)
throughout most of the site region to the south and uplift to the north, which achieves a
maximum (~10 mm/yr) near Hudson Bay, the site of thickest ice at the last glacial maximum.
Studies of fluctuating water levels in the Great Lakes region indicate that these resulted from
climate changes, as well as from the pattern of GIA-related uplift (Larsen 1985). The erosional
and depositional terraces studied along the shores of Lakes Huron and Michigan were left at
progressively higher altitudes northward, reflecting differences in the rates of rebound from
south to north (Larsen 1985).
Bedrock pop-up structures are elongate anticlinal features that form at the bedrock surface by
buckling under horizontal compression. They have been documented throughout southern
Ontario, and most can be shown unequivocally to be postglacial, and thus neotectonic
(e.g., Wallach 1990, Rutty and Cruden 1993, McFall 1993, Jacobi et al. 2007). Pop-ups
generally appear as narrow ridges with open fractures located along their crests, and some
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                       - 38 -                                March 2011
exhibit an en-echelon geometry (Rutty and Cruden 1993). The formation of pop-ups in this
region can be attributed in most cases to the retreat of the Laurentide ice sheet and the
reduction of the vertical component of crustal stress. Jacobi et al. (2007) investigated a popup
field on the floor of western Lake Ontario. They report that the popups formed throughout late
and postglacial time during the past 20,000 years, following the last glacial maximum. The
earliest set of popups investigated trend west-northwest, and do not parallel major geophysical
or structural linear zones in the region, suggesting that they developed in response to glacial
rebound-induced stress. Younger popups form an irregular pattern with several orientations of
axes. Jacobi et al. (2007) suggest that recently formed popups are likely a response to
reduced glacial stress combined with far-field tectonic stresses.
2.4       Local Geologic Setting
The Bruce nuclear site is located on the eastern shore of Lake Huron between the
northeastern edge of the Michigan basin and the northwestern edge of the Algonquin arch
(Figure 2.3). The site is underlain by approximately 850 m of limestone, dolostone, shale, and
evaporites ranging in age from Upper Cambrian to Middle Devonian (INTERA 2011).
Descriptions of these sediments and their depositional history are included in the Regional
Geology Report (AECOM AND ITASCA CANADA 2011), a supporting technical report
prepared as part of the Phase 1 Geosynthesis Program for the Bruce nuclear site.
A model of regional-scale networks of east-west-trending and northeast-southwest-trending
fractures and faults were postulated by Sanford et al. (1985) in southwestern Ontario. They
proposed that these fractures developed during Iapetan rifting and suggested that subsequent
compressional and extensional tectonic regimes during the Phanerozoic periodically
reactivated these fractures. The reactivation occurred through uplift of the basement-cored
arches marginal to the Paleozoic sedimentary basins, as well as through small-scale
differential vertical displacement across the fracture/fault-bounded blocks. Using a large
multiparameter geophysical and subsurface geological database, including newly processed
data, Boyce and Morris (2002) investigated the relation between Precambrian basement
structures and the occurrence of Paleozoic faults in southern Ontario. Their mapping indicates
that regional basement magnetic trends in southern Ontario are systematically related to
fracture patterns that occur within the overlying Paleozoic sedimentary rocks, which suggests
reactivation and upward propagation of basement faults and fractures into overlying cover
strata.
Well-defined aeromagnetic anomalies interpreted to represent deep-seated Precambrian
ductile structures occur beneath the Paleozoic cover rocks underlying the western Lake
Ontario region and extend northwestward into Georgian Bay (Figure 2.21). Although deep
seismic data collected across some of these structures in Lakes Erie and Ontario suggest that
they have been tectonically stable since early Paleozoic times (e.g., Forsyth et al. 1994a, b;
Milkereit et al. 1992), some have been identified as potentially active features based on the
locations of nearby faults and fractures observed in outcrops of Precambrian and Paleozoic
bedrock (Wallach and Mohajer 1990). Eyles et al. (1993) have presented evidence suggesting
that relict drainage systems that cut across the lower Paleozoic rocks in the western Lake
Ontario region have been controlled in part by reactivation of some of the Precambrian
structures associated with these geophysical lineaments.
Structural features that could be possible seismic sources have been investigated and are
incorporated into the seismic hazard analysis for the Bruce nuclear. These sources, which
include the Grenville Front tectonic zone, Georgian Bay linear zone, Niagara-Pickering linear
zone, Clarendon-Linden fault system and Hamilton-Presqu’ile lineament (Figure 2.22), are

described in Section 3.3. Other notable structural features identified in the region are
described below.

2.4.1     Erie–Georgian Bay Lineament
This lineament was identified and named by Boyce and Morris (2002), who recognized it as
part of a linear zone of mapped northeast-trending aeromagnetic lineaments in southern
Ontario (2-23). Reprocessing and digital image enhancement was used by Boyce and Morris
(2002), along with existing regional gravity and aeromagnetic data sets to facilitate lineament
mapping. The Erie–Georgian Bay Lineament (EGBL) is the westernmost of a series of parallel
“en echelon” lineaments that include the Hamilton-Lake Erie lineament (HLEL) and the
prominent Niagara-Pickering linear zone that bounds the series of northeast-trending
lineaments on the east (Boyce and Morris 2002). Citing the work of previous investigators
(e.g., Wallach and Mohajer 1990), Boyce and Morris (2002) suggest that these
northeast-trending lineaments may be associated with reactivated basement faults that are
related to Grenville-age terrane boundaries.
Paleozoic faults mapped in southern Ontario by Carter et al. (1996) are approximately parallel
to, but not coincident with, the EGBL. The Paleozoic faults are interpreted to reflect the
structural grain of the Precambrian basement rocks (Carter et al. 1996).

A cluster of seismic events was recorded over a section of this lineament by a small seismic
telemetry network from July 1980 to August 1984 (Mereu et al. 1986). The earthquakes were
mainly in the magnitude 1 – 2 range, although there were also three felt events with
magnitudes larger than 3. All of these events were in the vicinity of the Gobles oil field and
had hypocenters near the depth of the producing stratigraphic horizon. The events appeared
to be associated with at least two active faults oriented almost perpendicular to each other.
Mereu et al. (1986) concluded that the earthquakes were induced or triggered by fluids
pumped into and out of wells during secondary recovery activities in the Gobles oil field.
2.4.2     Erie-Huron Linear Zone
This lineament was recognized and named by Boyce and Morris (2002) as a broad (>80 km)
belt of low-amplitude, linear and curvilinear magnetic anomalies that extend from eastern Lake
Huron south toward western and central Lake Erie (Figure 2.23). Lineaments within the
Erie-Huron Linear Zone (EHLZ) have a north-northwest strike and are approximately parallel
with the GBLZ. The northwest-trending magnetic lineaments in southern Ontario have similar
trends to larger-scale, northwest-trending basement geophysical lineaments in the eastern
United States, and, thus, may record transform faults formed initially during Iapetan rifting also.
A cluster of earthquakes has been recorded at the south end of this linear zone.
Boyce and Morris (2002) note that these events are coincident with the west-east-trending
Electric fault (described below), which is a Paleozoic fault that is reported to appear as a
distinct topographic lineament in satellite imagery. In the vicinity of the EHLZ, however,
Boyce and Morris (2002) note that the earthquake cluster may be artificially induced, as the
Electric fault system is associated with several producing oil and gas fields.
2.4.3     Hamilton–Lake Erie Lineament
The Hamilton–Lake Erie lineament was identified and named by Wallach et al. (1998) as
approximately parallel to, and about 50 km west of, the Niagara-Pickering linear zone.
Wallach et al. (1998) suggest that the parallelism and proximity of the Hamilton-Lake Erie
Lineament (HLEL) to the Niagara-Pickering linear zone suggests that the two might be part of
the same fault zone.
Boyce and Morris (2002) recognize the HLEL as part of a linear zone of mapped
northeast-trending aeromagnetic lineaments that include the EGBL and Niagara-Pickering
linear zone (Figure 2.23). Boyce and Morris (2002) also recognize a well-defined elliptical
gravity low that corresponds with a zone of low magnetic intensity that is bounded by the
EGBL and HLEL and records a distinct lithotectonic domain.
2.4.4     Electric Fault and Dawn Fault
The east-west-trending Electric fault (Figure 2.21) is located on the northern margin of the
Chatham sag and deflects the nose of the Algonquin arch to the west. The Electric fault is a
south-side-down normal fault with a maximum observed vertical displacement on the
Precambrian surface of approximately 93 m (Brigham 1971). The Electric fault had recurrent
displacement in the Paleozoic; it displaces structure contours on the top of the uppermost Late
Silurian Bass Island Group and the base of the lower Middle Devonian Detroit River Group, but
does not offset the base of the overlying Dundee Limestone (Brigham 1971).

   Figure 2.23: Interpreted Aeromagnetic and Gravity Lineaments in Southern Ontario
A nontectonic origin for Holocene fault movement on the Electric fault was postulated by
Cumming and Al-Aasm (1999) from an analysis of porewater isotope chemistry from cores in
the St. Clair River delta. Differences in porewater mixing and displacement rates between
boreholes may result from vertical movement along the Electric fault due to collapse related to
the dissolution of Salina salt beds within the southern, downthrown block of the fault. Although
no faulting or fracturing is visible in cores, microscale faulting may have occurred, increasing
secondary hydraulic conductivity (Cumming and Al-Aasm 1999).
The Dawn fault (Figure 2.21) is an east-west-trending fault that has been identified in borings
and with geophysical data. The fault is a south-side-down normal fault with a maximum
observed vertical displacement of approximately 60 m (Brigham 1971). The Dawn fault
displaces the base but not the top of the lower Devonian Detroit River Group.
Boyce and Morris (2002) speculate that the Electric and other east-west-trending faults in
southwestern Ontario are related to the Mesozoic St. Lawrence Valley system rifting that
occurred in the Mesozoic. However, the absence of displacements by the Electric and Dawn
faults of units younger than the lower Middle Devonian Detroit River Group does not support this
hypothesis.

2.5      Seismicity
Characterization of the seismicity of the region surrounding the Bruce nuclear site forms an
essential part of the assessment of the seismic hazard. The primary means of characterization
of the seismicity is use of the earthquake catalogue. The earthquake catalogue is used to
assess earthquake occurrence rates and as part of the assessment of maximum magnitudes
for earthquake sources. This section describes the development and processing of the
earthquake catalogue.
2.5.1    Development of Earthquake Catalogue
The earthquake catalogue was developed for the region extending from latitude 38ºN 50ºN
and longitude 65º W to 90º W. The primary source of data for the project catalogue is the
Seismic Hazard Earthquake Epicenter File (SHEEF) developed by the Geological Survey of
Canada (GSC) (Halchuk 2009). The GSC SHEEF catalogue was compiled for use in the 2005
Fourth Generation Seismic Hazard Maps of Canada. The catalogue was updated by the GSC
to include earthquakes through the end of 2007. The GSC SHEEF catalogue has been
supplemented for this study by downloading earthquake data for 2008 from the National
Earthquake Data Base (NEDB) of Canada (accessed on October 14, 2009).
The secondary source of earthquake data was the catalogue compiled by the U.S. Geological
Survey for development of the U.S. National Seismic Hazard Maps (Petersen et al. 2008).
This catalogue consists of earthquake data through the end of 2006. The USGS national
hazard mapping catalogue was supplemented for the years 2007 and 2008 by data from the
Advanced National Seismic Systems (ANSS) online catalogue (accessed on October 23,
2009). The USGS national catalogue was then merged with the GSC SHEEF catalogue and
duplicates were removed. Preference was given to the GSC SHEEF catalogue when selecting
parameters for earthquakes north of the Canada-United States border, and to the USGS
catalogue for earthquakes south of the Canada-United States border.
The most important data for characterizing the size of earthquakes in the pre-instrumental
period (prior to about 1920) is the level of shaking intensity. Shaking-intensity data for
earthquakes in the combined catalogue were obtained from two primary sources:
Smith (1962, 1966) and the NCEER-91 catalogue (Seeber and Armbruster 1991). These data
are used to develop the unified moment magnitudes for the earthquakes as described in
Section 2.5.2. Additional historical earthquakes were compiled from Metzger et al. (2000) and
OPG (2001).
The resulting earthquake catalogue data was then supplemented by data for specific
earthquakes provided in Ma and Atkinson (2006); Ma and Eaton (2007); Ma et al. (2008);
Lamontagne and Ranalli (1997); Dineva et al. (2004); Du et al. (2003); Faust et al. (1997);
Fujita and Sleep (1991); and Ruff et al. (1994). Nontectonic events identified in

Pomeroy et al. (1976); and the ANSS and NEDB blast lists were then removed from the
catalogue.
2.5.2    Conversion to Moment Magnitude
The magnitude scale used in the GSC is Nuttli magnitude, MN; the scale used in the USGS
catalogue is the equivalent body-wave magnitude, mbLg; and the scale used in modern
ground-motion models is moment magnitude, M. In order to provide consistency between the
earthquake occurrence parameters and the ground motion assessment in the PSHA for the
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                       - 43 -                                March 2011
nuclear site, a unified moment-magnitude estimate was developed for each earthquake
magnitude.
2.5.2.1    Direct Estimates of Moment Magnitude
Direct estimates of seismic moment were obtained from the literature for a limited number of
events. The data sources were Street and Turcotte (1977); Boore and Atkinson (1987);
Du et al. (2003); Atkinson and Boore (2006); Johnston (1996a, 1996b); Bent (1992, 1996); the
St. Louis University Earthquake Center website; and the Harvard Moment Tensor Catalog.
Three studies provided approximate moment magnitudes for earthquakes in the study region.
Boatwright (1994) inverted vertical recordings from the Eastern Canadian Telemetered
Network to obtain estimates of earthquake source spectra, including seismic moment. Figure
2.24 compares Boatwright’s (1994) estimates of moment magnitude with moment magnitudes
obtained from standard waveform inversion. The moment-magnitude values obtained by
Boatwright (1994) are close to reported moment magnitudes for values of M below 3.5 and
tend to slightly underestimate the value of M at larger values. A locally weighted, least-
squares fit, to the data shown on Figure 2.24 was used to correct the moment magnitudes
reported in Boatwright (1994) to values of M used in this study.
Macheridas (2002) developed estimates of moment magnitudes for northeastern U.S.
earthquakes using a coda wave technique. Figure 2.25 compares her estimates with moment
magnitudes obtained from standard waveform inversion. The moment-magnitude values
obtained by Macheridas (2002) are close to reported moment magnitudes, albeit with
considerable scatter. A least-squares fit to the data shown on Figure 2.25 was used to correct
the moment magnitudes reported in Macheridas (2002) to values of M used in this study.
Atkinson (2004) developed estimates of moment magnitudes for eastern Canada earthquakes
based on analysis of Fourier spectra. Figure 2.26 compares her estimates with moment
magnitudes obtained from standard waveform inversion. The moment-magnitude values
obtained by Atkinson (2004) are close to reported moment magnitudes for values of M above
magnitude 4, overestimating M by about 0.2 units for smaller values. A locally weighted
least-squares fit to the data shown on Figure 2.26 was used to correct the moment magnitudes
reported in Atkinson (2004) to values of M used in this study.
2.5.2.2    Conversion from Other Size Measures
Moment-magnitude estimates for the remaining earthquakes in the catalogue were based on
empirical relationships between the available size measures and M.
The GSC SHEEF catalogue reports values of local magnitude, ML, for most of the earthquakes
in the historical period (prior to about 1920). However, comparison of these magnitudes with
values of maximum intensity reported in Smith (1962, 1966) suggests that these values of ML
are based on the relationship ML = ⅔ I0 + 1 developed by Gutenberg and Richter (1958) for
California earthquakes. Therefore, a more direct estimate of M was made by developing an
empirical relationship between I0 and M. Figure 2.27 shows the data set of earthquakes with
reported values of I0 and M. This data set includes earthquakes with values of M estimated
from the data in Boatwright (1994); Macheridas (2002); and Atkinson (2004). Shown on Figure
2.27 is the relationship between I0 and M developed by Johnston (1996b) using a worldwide
data set of stable continental region (SCR) earthquakes, primarily for values of I0 5 and larger.
The Johnston (1996b) relationship overestimates the values of M at intensities less than 8.

The red curve shows the locally weighted least-squares fit to the data used to provide
estimated values of M from I0.

        relationship used to adjust M_Boatwright to values of M used in this study.
  Figure 2.24: Comparison of Moment Magnitude Estimates with Reported Values of M
The other size measure used for historical earthquakes is the natural log of the felt area (lnFA).
Figure 2.28 compares the available data for earthquakes with reported values of lnFA and M
with the relationship developed by Johnston (1996b). The limited data are consistent with the
Johnston (1996) relationship and were used to develop values of M.

        Notes: Moment magnitude estimates are from Macheridas (2002). Red curves indicate
        relationship used to adjust M_Macheridas to values of M used in this study.
   Figure 2.25: Comparison of Moment Magnitude Estimates with Reported Values of M
The majority of earthquake magnitudes reported in the GSC SHEEF catalogue are in the
body-wave MN magnitude scale. Relationships between MN and M have been developed by
Atkinson and Boore (1995) and Sonley and Atkinson (2005). The MN-M data shown on the
figure were assembled by Bent (2010). As suggested by Bent (2010), a simple relationship of
the form M = MN + C provides as good a fit as the other published relationships within the
range of the data. Bent (2010) also reports an apparent change in the scaling between MN and
M that occurs for the years after about 1995, such that the constant offset changes from about
-0.4 to about –0.5. The MN-M data were analysed, and the change in scaling from -0.41 to
-0.57 was determined to be statistically significant. Therefore, the conversion from MN to M
used for the project catalogue consisted of M = MN – 0.41 for years before 1998 and M = MN –
0.57 for 1998 and after, with a standard error of 0.18 magnitude units.
The other body-wave magnitudes reported for earthquakes in the catalogue are in the mbLg
scale. This scale is generally similar to the MN scale but is typically based on recordings on a
different type of instrument. Figure 2.29 compares the available mbLg-M data from the project
catalogue with two published relationships and the MN-M conversion used in this study. The
relationship developed by Johnston (1996a) appears more consistent with the data, thus it was
used to develop estimates of M from reported values of mbLg.

        Notes: Moment magnitude estimates are from Atkinson (2004). Red curves indicate relationship
        used to adjust M_Atkinson to values of M used in this study.
  Figure 2.26: Comparison of Moment Magnitude Estimates with Reported Values of M
The earthquake catalogue contains three other magnitude measures: local magnitude ML,
coda magnitude MC and duration magnitude MD. Figure 2.30 compares the available ML-M
data pairs from the project catalogue to the relationship published by Johnston (1996a). The
data do not appear consistent with the Johnston (1996a) ML-M relationship. Therefore, the
least-squares fit to the data shown on Figure 2.30 was used to develop estimates of M from
ML. Figure 2.31 compares MC and MD magnitudes to MN magnitudes for earthquakes in the
project catalogue. These magnitudes appear to be equivalent to MN, and the MN to M
conversion developed above for the years before 1998 was used to estimate M from MC and
MD magnitudes.
Finally, Johnston et al. (1994) report values of M for several earthquakes in the project
catalogue developed from empirical relationships between the area with various shaking
intensity isoseismals and moment magnitude. These magnitudes and their uncertainties were
adopted for use in the project catalogue.

2.5.2.3    Uniform Magnitude Scale
A uniform moment magnitude was computed for all events using the formulation presented in
EPRI-SOG (1988). The appropriate conversion relations are applied to each earthquake in the
catalogue to obtain a value of M and its prediction uncertainty  P given by the equation:
                                              P   res    2
                                                                E2 [ M X ]                              (2.1)
where    E[M X ] is the uncertainty in the mean of M given the value of the independent variable
X and  res is the residual standard error. These values are either computed from the
regression analyses described above or taken from the published relationships used in the
conversion. If a measured value of M is available for an event, it is taken as the expected
value of M, and a standard deviation of 0.1 is assigned as an average uncertainty in estimating
M unless one is given in the data source.
For the majority of events, the value of M is estimated from the other available size measures.
Given multiple measures of the earthquake size, the expected value and variance of M are
calculated as in EPRI-SOG (1988) using Equations 2-2 and 2-3:

where X̂ is the vector of different earthquake size measures, X̂ i is a single member of X̂ , r is
the number of earthquake size measures and β =bln(10). The b-value was set at an initial
estimate of 1.0. After one pass through the process of assessing completeness and seismicity
parameters, an average b-value near 0.9 was determined.
As discussed in EPRI-SOG (1988), uncertainty in the magnitude estimates and its propagation
through the magnitude conversion process introduces a bias in the estimated earthquake
occurrence rates. This bias is corrected by using an adjusted magnitude M* for each
earthquake and then computing the earthquake recurrence parameters by maximum likelihood
using earthquake counts in terms of M*. The adjusted magnitude is defined by the relationship
                                        M *  M   M2 M instrumental / 2                                (2.4)
when M is based on instrumentally recorded moment magnitudes and by the relationship
                                             M *  M   M2 X / 2                                        (2.5)
when M is based on other size measures X, such as maximum intensity I0 or other magnitude
measures, such as MN. The change in sign in the correction term from negative in
Equation 2.4 to positive in Equation (2.5) reflects the effects of the uncertainty in the
conversion from size measure X to M.

2.5.3    Identification of Independent Earthquakes
The PSHA formulation used to assess the earthquake hazard at the Bruce nuclear site is
based on the Poisson model for the occurrence of independent earthquakes. Therefore,
dependent earthquakes (foreshocks and aftershocks) must be identified and not included in
the earthquake statistics. Dependent earthquakes were identified by applying the declustering
algorithm developed by EPRI-SOG (1988). The standard method of creating a catalogue of
independent earthquakes developed by Gardner and Knopoff (1974) is to remove all smaller
earthquakes within a fixed time and distance window about a large earthquake. In contrast,
the approach developed by EPRI-SOG (1988) is to perform a statistical test of the rate of
earthquakes in the immediate time and distance interval about a large earthquake. If the rate
of earthquakes is significantly higher than a background rate in the local neighborhood of the
main event, then earthquakes are removed until the rate becomes consistent with the
background rate. The dependent earthquakes identified with this procedure are indicated in
the earthquake catalogue listed in Appendix A.

2.5.4     Earthquake Catalogue Completeness
Assessment of earthquake occurrence rates requires an evaluation of the completeness of the
earthquake catalogue. The standard technique for maximum likelihood estimation of
earthquake rates (e.g., Weichert 1980) is to use only the earthquake counts within the
assessed period of complete reporting in the earthquake catalogue. EPRI-SOG (1988)
extended the maximum likelihood approach to incorporate data from both the period of
complete catalogue reporting and the period of incomplete catalogue reporting. For the period
of incomplete reporting, a probability of detection, PD, is defined that represented the
probability that the occurrence of an earthquake would ultimately be recorded in the
earthquake catalogue for the region. EPRI-SOG (1988) provided estimates of PD for the
central and eastern United States and southeastern Canada. Figure 2.32 shows the
EPRI-SOG (1988) catalogue completeness regions that cover the study area.
        Note: Earthquake catalogue is from Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI 1988).
         Figure 2.32: Catalogue Completeness Regions in the Project Study Area
The values of PD were reassessed for completeness regions 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11 using the
updated earthquake catalogue and the EPRI-SOG (1988) computer program EQPARAM.
Consistent with the software application, the magnitude bins were set at a width of
0.6 magnitude units, starting at M* 3.3. Examination of the results indicated that fitting a
truncated exponential model to the full magnitude range from M 3.3 to 7.5 resulted in an
underprediction of the observed rates for the larger-magnitude earthquakes. The EPRI-SOG
(1988) approach provided for the ability to assign relative weights to the various magnitude
intervals in fitting the truncated exponential model to the observed data. The departure from
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                        - 54 -                              March 2011
the truncated exponential model at larger magnitudes may by due to a possible excess of
magnitudes in the lowest magnitude interval, 3.3 ≤ M* < 3.9. This magnitude interval is most
affected by the nonlinear I0 to M conversion. Therefore, the weight assigned to this interval
was reduced from 1.0 to values of 0.1 and 0.01.
The resulting models of catalogue completeness produced reasonable fits to the observed
rates of the larger earthquakes that are important to the assessment of the seismic hazard.
Comparisons between the observed and predicted seismicity rates are provided in Section 3.4.
Two earthquake catalogue completeness models were carried forward into the PSHA analysis:
Model A is based on a weight of 0.1 assigned to data in the magnitude interval 3.3 ≤ M* < 3.9
when fitting earthquake occurrence relationships, and Model B is based on a weight of
0.01 assigned to data in the magnitude interval 3.3 ≤ M* < 3.9. The resulting values of PD for
models A and B are listed in Table 2.2 and Table 2.3, respectively.

3.         SEISMIC SOURCE CHARACTERIZATION
A seismic source characterization (SSC) model was developed that characterises all seismic
sources (areal source zones and fault sources) that could be of significance to the hazard at
the Bruce nuclear site.
3.1        Types of Uncertainties and Logic Tree Structure
Types of uncertainties (i.e., aleatory and epistemic) and the general logic tree structure used
for seismic source characterization for the probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA)
are described in this section.
3.1.1      Aleatory and Epistemic Uncertainty
A key focus of this study is to identify and quantify the uncertainties associated with seismic
source characteristics, thus fully incorporating the current knowledge and uncertainties into the
hazard analysis. As discussed in the Senior Seismic Hazard Analysis Committee’s
Recommendations for Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis (SSHAC 1997), PSHA
incorporates both aleatory uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. Aleatory uncertainty (or
variability) is the natural randomness in a process, and epistemic uncertainty is the scientific
uncertainty in the process due to limited data and knowledge. Examples of aleatory
uncertainty are variation in the peak ground motion of individual recordings about a median
ground-motion relationship, and the location and magnitude of the next earthquake. Examples
of epistemic uncertainty are alternative models for ground motion estimation and the long-term
rate of slip on a particular fault.
In concept, epistemic uncertainties are potentially reducible with additional data, while aleatory
uncertainties are irreducible. For example, a fault’s slip rate and its associated uncertainties
could be quantified at a particular point in time, followed by a program of field data collection
and interpretation, followed in turn by another assessment of uncertainty. If properly quantified
in the first place, the second assessment should result in slip rate estimates that lie entirely
within the first range of assessments. Further, the second assessment range of possible slip
rate values may be narrower or the relative weights on the central and outlying estimates may
have changed. Thus one way to mitigate the potential for large fluctuations in seismic hazard
estimates over time is to properly quantify epistemic uncertainties. The present study was
carried out with that goal in mind.
Significant advances in the development of the methodology for quantifying epistemic
uncertainty in seismic hazard have been made during the past decades (SSHAC 1997).
These advances involve the development and weighting of alternative interpretations of
seismic source characteristics to provide a structured characterization of epistemic uncertainty
suitable for seismic hazard computation. For a PSHA, the weighted alternative interpretations
are typically expressed in logic trees.
A logic tree consists of a series of nodes and branches that describe the alternative models or
parameter values or both. At each node, there is a set of branches that represent the range of
alternative credible models or parameter values. The branch weights must sum to unity at
each node. The weights on the branches of logic trees reflect scientific judgments in the
relative confidence in the alternative models and should be consistent with the knowledge and
understanding of the informed scientific community.
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                        - 61 -                                March 2011
Epistemic uncertainty is the result of limited data (often very limited). In seismic hazard
analyses, evaluating the alternative models involves considering alternative simplified physical
models, data from analogous regions, and empirical observations. These are subjective. In
some cases, uncertainties are developed from formal statistical assessment of fitting models to
data (e.g., recurrence rate and b-value parameters obtained from fitting the truncated
exponential recurrence model to recorded seismicity).
Each pathway through the composite (across all sources) logic trees represents a complete
interpretation of the seismic sources of the site for which an aleatory seismic hazard curve is
computed. Each pathway is associated with a probability equal to the product of the
conditional probabilities of all the branches along the way. The result of computing the hazard
for all pathways is a family of hazard curves, each with an associated weight, representing the
full aleatory variability and epistemic uncertainty in the hazard at a site.
3.1.2     Logic Trees
The uncertainty assessment in this study is performed using a logic tree methodology. The
logic tree formulation for seismic hazard analysis (Coppersmith and Youngs 1986, EPRI 1988)
involves first setting out the sequence of assessments that must be made in order to perform
the analysis and then addressing the uncertainties in each of these assessments in a
sequential manner. Thus the methodology provides a convenient approach for breaking a
large, complex assessment into a sequence of smaller, simpler components that can be more
easily addressed.
The general structure of the logic tree used in this study is shown on Figure 3.1. The logic tree
is composed of a series of nodes and branches. Each node represents an assessment of a
state of nature or an input parameter value that must be made to perform the analysis. Each
branch leading from the node represents one possible discrete alternative for the state of
nature or parameter value being addressed. If the variable in question is continuous, it can be
discretised at a suitable increment. The branches at each node are intended to represent
mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive states of the input parameter. In practice, a
sufficient number of branches are placed at a given node to adequately represent the
uncertainty in the parameter estimation.
Probabilities assigned to each branch represent the relative likelihood or degree of belief that
the branch represents the correct value or state of the input parameter. These probabilities
are assessed conditional on the assumption that all the branches leading to that node
represent the true state of the preceding parameters. Because they are conditional
probabilities for an assumed mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive set of values, the
sum of the conditional probabilities at each node is unity. The probabilities are usually based
on scientific judgments because the available data are too limited to allow for objective
statistical analysis, and because scientific judgment is needed to weigh alternative
interpretations of the available data. The logic tree approach simplifies these assessments
because the uncertainty in a single parameter is considered individually with all other
assessments leading up to that parameter assessment assumed to be known with certainty.
Thus the nodes of the logic tree are sequenced to provide for the conditional aspects or
dependencies among the parameters and to provide a logical progression of assumptions from
the general to the specific in defining the input parameters for an evaluation.
In most cases, the probabilities (relative weights) assigned to the branches at a node are in
units of tenths unless there is a basis for finer-scale resolution. The weights represent one of
two types of probability assessments. In the first, the branches at a node of the logic tree

define the range of possible parameter values, and the associated weights assigned to the
branches define the probability distribution. For example, an estimate of the slip rate on a fault
is uncertain because of uncertainties in the amount of displacement of a particular geologic
unit across the fault and the age of the unit. The resulting slip rate is usually represented by a
preferred value and a range of higher and lower values, similar to a normal or lognormal
statistical distribution.
                     Figure 3.1: General Logic Tree Structure Used in PSHA
In some instances, this type of uncertainty in parameter assessment can be estimated using
formal statistical techniques. In these cases, continuous parameter distributions developed
from statistical estimation procedures can be discretised for use in a logic tree formulation.
Such an approach will be used to develop discrete distributions for earthquake recurrence
parameters and maximum magnitudes in Section 5.
A second type of probability assessment to which logic trees are particularly well suited
involves indicating a relative preference for, or degree of belief in, two (or more) alternative
hypotheses. For example, the sense of slip on a fault may be uncertain; two possible

alternatives might be strike-slip or reverse-slip. Based on the pertinent data, a relative
preference for these alternatives can be expressed by the logic tree weights. A very strong
preference for one over the other is usually represented by weights such as 0.9 and 0.1 for the
two alternatives. If there is no preference for either hypothesis, they are assigned equal
weights (0.5 and 0.5 for two hypotheses). Increasing the weight assigned to one of the
alternatives from 0.5 to 0.9 (or more) reflects an increasing preference for that alternative,
given the available data. Because the relative weights are ultimately scientific judgments
based on available information, it is important to document the data and interpretations that led
to the assessment of parameter values and to the assignment of relative weights in order that
the process can be reviewed by others.
Figure 3.1 lays out the logic tree structure that will be used in this PSHA. The logic tree is
schematic in that only the general levels of the logic tree are indicated. The first level of the
logic tree addresses the uncertainty in defining the appropriate ground-motion attenuation
model. Although uncertainty in identifying and characterizing seismic sources is the focus of
this study, the uncertainty in ground motion characterization will be included in the analysis in
order to indicate its relative importance in the overall uncertainty in the seismic hazard.
The second level of the generalised logic tree addresses the uncertainty in the appropriate
approach for regional seismic source zonation. The importance of this level of the logic tree is
that alternative approaches to regional seismic zonation may lead to the definition of different
seismic sources. Section 3.2 discusses the various methods that have been used to identify
seismic sources in the region and describes the basis for the seismic sources.
At this point the logic tree is expanded into subtrees, one for each seismic source identified
following a particular zonation approach. (The vertical line without a node [dot] on Figure 3.1
denotes summation of the hazard from multiple independent sources.) Two types of seismic
sources are defined in this study: regional areal sources and local sources. The regional
sources are identified by 1A and 1B to indicate that different sources may be defined using
different zonation approaches. The local sources are all given the same designation to
indicate that their definition is independent of the regional zonation approach.
The next level of uncertainty addressed is the likelihood that the individual local sources are
“seismogenic” (this term is defined in Section 3.2.1). If a local source is seismogenic, then it is
considered a discrete seismic source in addition to the regional source zone. If not, then only
the regional source zone is present. This assessment is only applied to the local sources, the
regional source zones are considered to be seismogenic with certainty (probability 1.0).
The final four levels of the logic tree address the assessment of maximum magnitude and
seismicity rate parameters. For each there is an assessment of the appropriate approach and
then an assessment of the parameters following the selected approach. The approaches that
will be used for assessment of maximum magnitude and seismicity rate parameters are
discussed in Section 5.
3.2       Regional Seismic Sources
The logic structure used to define the relationships among regional seismic sources in the site
region is given in the logic tree shown on Figure 3.2. The first assessment looks at three
alternative approaches to defining the models for the spatial distribution of future seismicity:
(1) seismic source zones based primarily on geologic and tectonic bases (Plates 1 through
24); (2) seismic source zones developed by the Geological Survey of Canada
(Adams and Halchuck 2003, Figure 3.3 and Plate 25) that enclose zones of elevated
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                        - 64 -                                 March 2011
seismicity; and (3) a zoneless approach based on smoothing observed seismicity without
imposed source zone boundaries (Plate 26). The geologic/tectonically based source zones
(Plates 1 through 24) are derived primarily on the basis of mapped or interpreted major
tectonic features and have potential differences in seismicity (earthquake recurrence rate and
maximum earthquake magnitude) from those of adjoining source zones. The geologic and
tectonic bases for source zonation are strongly favoured (0.8) over the alternatives that are
based on clusters of seismicity (0.2) because they subdivide the region into zones with more
uniform crustal characteristics. Defining sources as areas of uniform seismicity rate is not
necessary because the techniques used for seismicity modeling can allow for spatially varying
rates within a source (see Section 3.4). Thus it is judged that a geologic or tectonic basis is
more relevant for identifying regions of crust with homogeneous characteristics. The
seismicity-based approaches use the pattern of observed seismicity in a literal sense to define
the future pattern of earthquakes.
A key difference between these methodologies is the degree to which the spatial pattern of
observed seismicity (both historical and instrumentally recorded earthquakes) provides an
indication of the locations of future seismicity. The methodology used for spatial smoothing of
seismicity is one that smoothes both the rate of activity (a-value of the earthquake recurrence
relationship) and the b-value. The advantages of this approach are that it does not require an
interpretation of the boundaries of sources (i.e., the spatial density differences of seismicity are
evaluated automatically as part of the procedure) and there is flexibility in the degree to which
the seismicity is smoothed. The zoneless smoothing approach is equally weighted (0.1) with
the seismicity zones approach (0.1).
The second level of the logic tree addresses the basis for zonation, given the geologic/tectonic
approach for regional source modeling. For the geologic/tectonic approach, the boundary
between the St. Lawrence rift system (SLRS) and lapetan rifted margin (IRM) is judged to be
significant to defining regional sources. The weight of 0.8 for IRM separate from the SLRS is
based on the expression of rift faults. Normal faults of the SLRS are expressed at the surface
and provide evidence for multiple stages of reactivation (Tremblay et al. 2003,
Rocher et al. 2003, Lemieux et al. 2003, Rimando and Benn 2005). The IRM seismotectonic
zone has also experienced extension associated with lower Cambrian rifting; however, these
faults are inferred to exist beneath Appalachian thrust sheets (Wheeler 1995).
The third level of the logic tree (Figure 3.2) addresses whether the Grenville province is
included in the Central Craton. The presence of pervasive structural fabric associated with the
Grenville province postdating the Superior and Southern provinces is the basis for assigning a
weight of 0.6 to the logic tree branch of separate Grenville and Central Craton provinces.
The fourth level of the logic tree (Figure 3.2) addresses the location of the IRM boundary with
the Southern Grenville (SGR) source zone. This boundary is judged to be significant to
defining regional sources, as the seismogenic potential of a stable continental region is known
to vary significantly according to the degree of extension it experienced in the past
(e.g., Johnston et al. 1994). As discussed in Section 3.2.1.4, alternative locations are
considered: one proposed for this study (designated WAU, for Western Adirondack Uplift); one
proposed by Wheeler (1995); and one proposed by Milkereit et al. (1992) (designated CMBBZ,
for Central Metasedimentary Belt boundary zone). The weights assigned in Section 3.2 are
0.5, 0.4 and 0.1, respectively. For the CMBBZ alternative, two alternative domain boundaries
(eastern and western) are assigned equal weight (CMBBZ East and CMBBZ West). The
western boundary is based on the presence of the Mississauga domain as recognised by
O’Dowd et al. (2004).

The fifth assessment in the logic tree (Figure 3.2) considers alternative locations of the
Grenville/Central Craton boundary in southeastern Michigan, southwestern Ontario, and
northwestern Ohio defined by Easton and Carter (1995) and Hinze et al. (1975).
Easton and Carter (1995) interpreted the location of the Grenville Front tectonic zone (GFTZ)
based on geopotential field data, lithological drill cores, and seismic reflection profiles (Figure
2.8). Using the interpreted location of line J of Great Lakes International Multidisciplinary
Program on Crustal Evolution (GLIMPCE) as a control point in the area of Lake Huron, they
located the GFTZ to the east of the Killarney Magmatic Belt and extending along the Detroit
River through Michigan. This location of the GFTZ is consistent with interpretations by
Lucius and von Freese (1988) of geophysical anomalies, seismic reflection lines in Lake Erie
by Forsyth et al. (1994a), and COCORP line OH-1 by Pratt et al. (1989) and
Culotta et al. (1990). The placement of the GFTZ by Easton and Carter (1995) is to the east of
the location defined by Hinze et al. (1975) in southeastern Michigan. Hinze et al. (1975) based
their interpreted location (Figure 2.11) on the distinction between areas of positive
northeast-southwest-trending gravity and magnetic anomalies characteristic of the Grenville
province. Easton and Carter (1995) question the assignment of these anomalies to the
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                       - 67 -                                March 2011
Grenville province. The eastern boundary as defined by Easton and Carter (1995) is weighted
0.75, and the western boundary as defined by Hinze et al. (1975) is weighted 0.25.
The final column of the logic tree indicates the various seismic sources that exist given the
combination of branches leading to each end point. The plate number that shows the
configuration of a given set of seismic sources is indicated. The relative weight associated
with a specific combination of assessments is the product of the probabilities on all of the
branches. For example, Plate 1 illustrates that the St. Lawrence rift is separated from the IRM
by the eastern IRM boundary, and the Grenville province is separated from the Central Craton
by the eastern Grenville boundary. (Note that local seismic sources are superimposed on
these regional source zones, based on the probability of their being seismogenic).
The logic tree shown on Figure 3.2 lists only those regional sources that are affected by the
alternative interpretations considered in the tree. The hazard analysis is conducted using all of
the sources shown on Plates 1 through 25. For each of these sources, the assessment of
seismicity parameters follows the logic tree format presented in Section 3.4.
In all cases the regional source zones are assumed to be seismogenic with a probability of 1.0.
This is because the regional sources include a large region spatially and are likely to include at
least one fault (although unknown) capable of generating a moment magnitude (M) rating of
M > 5 earthquake. Because the regional sources exist everywhere in the study region, there is
a finite potential for earthquake occurrence everywhere in the study region.
3.2.1      Geologic/Tectonic Seismic Source Zones
Regional source zones for the Bruce nuclear site based on geology and tectonics are shown
on Plates 1 through 24. These sources are described below, beginning with the zone in which
the Bruce nuclear site is located.
3.2.1.1     Southern/Northern Grenville Source Zones
The Grenville (SGR and NGR) source zones represent non-extended crust of the Precambrian
Central Craton of North America (Wheeler and Johnston 1992). Both zones are characterised
by sparse and diffuse seismicity. Basement within the two zones consists of rocks deformed
during the Proterozoic Grenville orogen, which occurred over a period of about
200 million years (m.y.) between about 1160 and 970 Ma (Rivers et al. 1989).
The Grenville Front tectonic zone (GFTZ), which is associated with northwest-directed ductile
thrusting, marks the western boundary to the Grenville source zones. The GFTZ is a major
feature that traverses the Canadian Shield for more than 1,000 km, crossing Georgian Bay and
Lake Huron and extending into central Ohio. This feature is located within about 50 km of the
Bruce nuclear site. Although the GFTZ is assessed to have a very low probability (0.01) of
activity in the study region, for completeness it is considered a local seismic source and is
described in Section 3.3.2.
3.2.1.2     Central Craton Source Zone
The Central Craton source zone (CC) comprises non-extended Precambrian crust assigned to
several basement provinces. From north to south these include portions of the Superior,
Southern (Penokean orogen), Grenville and Eastern Granite-Rhyolite provinces (see
Figure 2.2). As described in Section 2.2, the ages of the rocks in these basement provinces
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                        - 68 -                                 March 2011
range from about 3.6 to 1.5 Ga. The Midcontinent rift system (see Section 2.2.4) is located
within the CC source zone. Low rates of seismicity characterize the CC source zone.
3.2.1.3    St. Lawrence Rift System Source Zone
The St. Lawrence rift system (SLRS) source zone encompasses a terrane of known and
inferred normal faults that formed parallel to the passive margin of Laurentia during the Late
Proterozoic–Early Paleozoic opening of the Iapetus Ocean (e.g., Wheeler 1995, 1996b).
Compressional reactivation of favourably oriented Iapetan faults has been postulated as the
causal mechanism for several seismically active regions in eastern North America, including
Charlevoix and the lower St. Lawrence Valley, Quebec (Adams and Basham 1991).
The 1925 Charlevoix event (M 6.2; Bent 1992) is considered by Adams et al. (1995) to be the
paradigm earthquake for the St. Lawrence source zone, although they acknowledge that the
great depth extent of seismicity and the length of the faults suggest much larger earthquakes
are possible. The Charlevoix region (CHV on Figure 3.3) hosts several large-magnitude
historical earthquakes: M ~7 1663; M ~6 1790; M ~6 1860; M ~6.5 1870; and Ms 6.2 ± 0.3
1925 (Lamontagne and Ranalli 1997, 1996).
Doig (1990) inferred a variable recurrence rate for the Charlevoix seismic zone from silt layers
in lakes due to earthquake-induced landslides. Some silt layers in the section were correlated
with historic earthquakes from 1638, 1663, 1791, 1870 and 1925. From 320 B.C. to A.D. 800,
Doig (1991) determined a 120-year recurrence interval, 270 years between 800 A.D. and 1500
A.D., and 75 years from A.D. 1500 to the present. Filion et al. (1991) interpreted two
earthquake induced landslides by dating tree rings in the base of flow materials of dammed
lakes along the Riviere du Gouffree located within the Charlevoix seismic zone. Tuttle and
Atkinson (2010) and Tuttle (2006) provide evidence for three Holocene paleoearthquakes in
Charlevoix with M ≥ 6.2, including at least two prehistoric episodes at 5,000 and 10,000 years
ago. The absence of liquefaction features to the south in the Trois-Rivières seismic zone of
the GSC H model (TRR on Figure 3.3) suggests that large-magnitude events in Charlevoix are
spatially stationary.
Within the Charlevoix seismic zone, focal mechanisms for earthquakes of magnitude ≥3 show
reverse faulting; smaller-magnitude earthquakes indicate some strike-slip and normal faulting.
This information led Lamontagne and Ranalli (1997) to suggest that local stress conditions
affect rupture style. The distribution of spatially clustered events (doublets and triplets) within
the Charlevoix seismic zone indicate that very few events have occurred on the same fractures
with similar focal mechanisms, implying that these fault zones occur in highly fractured rocks
(Lamontagne and Ranalli 1997). Hypcentral depths for the Charlevoix seismic zone occur as
deep as 29 km, although most earthquakes occur between 8 and 15 km
(Lamontagne and Ranalli 1996). Comparing this depth distribution to rheological models of the
region, Lamontagne and Ranalli (1996) attribute earthquakes in the Charlevoix seismic zone to
a brittle-ductile transition deeper than 25 km, corresponding to higher than average geotherms,
onset of ductility for hydrated feldspar at about 350°C, high pore-fluid pressure and a low
friction coefficient, possibly related to unhealed zones of intense fracturing.
Lamontagne et al. (2003) reviewed the seismotectonic characteristics of a region they refer to
as the lower St. Lawrence seismic zone (BSL on Figure 3.3), in which a moderate earthquake
of magnitude MN 5.1 occurred under the St. Lawrence River in 1999. This localised zone of
seismicity occurs within the Precambrian basement where intersecting faults of different
orientations may be weakened by crustal fluid at depth, hydrostatic pressure, or fault gauge.

Emplacement of the Sept-Iles layered igneous complex may have further fractured this portion
of crust (Lamontagne et al. 2003).
Saguenay and Ottawa Grabens
In southeastern Canada, the IRM is associated with two failed arms, or aulacogens, that
formed transverse to the faulted edge of the ancient continental margin. These aulacogens
are oriented at a high angle to the Iapetan margin and extend into the unrifted (non-extended)
craton of Grenville crust. They comprise the Saguenay and Ottawa grabens, which are
defined by zones of approximately east-west-trending normal faults extending into the
Canadian Shield. The normal faults comprising these aulacogens have not undergone
significant total extension; however, their dimensions and earthquake depths are likely similar
to those of the Iapetan margin (Adams et al. 1996).
The Ottawa graben extends for approximately 700 km into the Canadian Shield
(Kumarapeli and Saull 1966, Kumarapeli 1985, 1993) from the Sutton Mountains salient of the
central Appalachian orogen (Rankin 1976; Plate 1). The graben is inferred to extend eastward
beneath the Appalachian thrust sheets for approximately 30 km (Kumarapeli 1993). Alkalic
intrusions within the Ottawa graben yield an early Cambrian age (approximately 565 Ma;
Kumarapeli 1985). A tholeiitic diabase dike swarm associated with the graben is dated at
590 Ma, implying that the initiation of rifting was a Late Proterozoic event (Kumarapeli 1985).
The faults defining the Ottawa graben generally strike west-northwest and offset Silurian strata
(Forsyth 1981). In addition, a Late Jurassic kimberlite dike occurs at the western end of the rift
(Poole et al. 1970).
Adams et al. (1996) consider the 1935 Timiskaming (M 6.2) event, which occurred at a depth
of 10 km near the Quebec-Ontario border, the paradigm earthquake for the Ottawa graben.
Aylsworth et al. (2000) attributed widespread landsliding and irregular subsidence along the
Ottawa River to two paleoearthquakes occurring at about 7,060 and 4,550 BP that could be as
large as the 1663 Charlevoix (>M 7) event. Doig (1991) interprets two paleo events from
earthquake induced landslide sediments within lakes near the 1935 Timiskaming event.
Results of the 1982 Canadian Consortium for Crustal Reconnaissance Using Seismic
Techniques (COCRUST) long-range seismic refraction experiment show a sharp, step-like
displacement of the Moho beneath the south shoulder of the Ottawa graben, confirming the
deep-seated nature of its faults and penetration of mantle melts into the crust
(Mereu et al. 1986). Furthermore, the COCRUST surveys show a poorly defined Moho at
unusually shallow depths beneath the graben (Mereu et al. 1986).
The Saguenay graben also represents a failed arm of the Iapetan passive margin
(Kumarapeli 1985) and extends into the Canadian Shield for approximately 300 km from the
St. Lawrence Valley (Figure 3.3). The graben margins are defined by approximately
east-west-striking faults; their extent and geometry at depth are unknown
(DuBerger et al. 1991). Syn-rift carbonatite complexes dated at 565 Ma imply an early
Cambrian age of the graben (Kumarapeli 1985). Some of the graben-bounding faults offset
Ordovician limestone by as much as 500 m and are marked by prominent topographic scarps
having 100 – 300 m of relief (DuBerger et al. 1991). Unlike the Ottawa aulacogen, there is no
evidence for Mesozoic reactivation in the Saguenay graben. The paradigm earthquake for the
Saguenay graben is the 1988 Saguenay (M 5.9) event, which occurred at a depth of 27 km
(Adams et al. 1996). Seismicity in the region was very low prior to this event
(DuBerger et al. 1991). Doig (1998) determined a recurrence interval ranging from 350 to
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                         - 70 -                                 March 2011
1000 years based on evidence of earthquake-induced landslide deposits within lakes near the
epicenter of the 1988 earthquake.
Southwestward Extension
Various authors have postulated a southwesterly midcontinent extension (i.e., aulacogen) of
the SLRS, which is now recognised as a remnant of the IRM (Wheeler 1996a). For example,
Adams and Basham (1989) postulated such an extension in the region of the New Madrid rift
in the central United States, although they later retracted this speculation, citing a lack of
evidence (Adams and Basham 1991). However, to allow for this hypothesis, we consider
possible local evidence for a southwesterly extension of the rift system in the southern Great
Lakes region.
Grier (1995) reported that brittle faulting occurs on a series of north-northeast- and
northeast-trending faults along the upper St. Lawrence Valley, from Kingston to Cornwall. The
faults in this region generally exhibit offsets of up to tens of meters, and show variable slip
directions (Grier 1995). However, the amount and timing of brittle deformation on these faults
and their relationship with the much larger faults along the St. Lawrence Valley north of
Cornwall are unknown (Grier 1995).
Gauthier and Benn (1996) identified two prominent northeast-striking faults on the Frontenac
arch in northern New York State. These faults are associated with brittle deformation and are
interpreted to be reactivated Grenville ductile structures (Gauthier and Benn 1996). The
recognition of these structures led Gauthier and Benn (1996) to suggest that other
northeast-southwest-trending lineaments along the upper St. Lawrence River may correspond
to reactivated basement structures, which may form a possible structural linkage between
Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence rift.
In an abstract, Wallach and Thomas (1996) suggested that the Carthage-Colton mylonite
zone, a sinuous, ductile structure separating the Frontenac and Central Granulite blocks within
the Grenville province, denotes the southern limit of the St. Lawrence fault zone (i.e., rift).
Wallach and Thomas (1996) further suggested that the features in the South Ontario structural
zone, which lie approximately along the southwest projection of the Carthage-Colton mylonite
zone, represent brittle reactivation of this originally ductile Grenville structure.
Faure et al. (2006) performed paleostress analysis of mesoscopic faults and emplacement of
Jurassic dikes in Quebec and New Brunswick and concluded that although Atlantic rifting was
a widespread extension event, it extended as far as 400 km into the plate. Preexisting late
Proterozoic, Taconic, Acadian, and Alleghenian structures within this zone were reactivated
during the opening of the Atlantic Ocean and are kinematically linked to faults bounding
Mesozoic basins.
Deep seismic data collected along and across the Ottawa River (e.g., Mereu et al. 1986) show
crustal-scale extension on the approximately east-west-trending, high-angle faults within the
Ottawa aulacogen. Similarly, seismic profiles collected across the St. Lawrence Valley and the
northern Appalachian front indicate step-faulting of the Grenville basement, with displacements
ranging from 200 to 1,000 m, extending eastward beneath the Appalachian thrust sheets
(St.-Julien et al. 1983). The deep seismic data collected in Lakes Ontario and Erie
(e.g., Milkereit et al. 1992, Forsyth et al. 1994a, 1994b, Zelt et al. 1994, White et al. 1994) do
not show any high-angle extensional structures or extensional deformation on the scale of the
Ottawa graben faults or the St. Lawrence Valley faults, providing very strong evidence that a
failed rift arm does not extend into the lake. The well-documented, high-angle Iapetan faults
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                           - 71 -                                March 2011
that cut Grenville basement along the St. Lawrence, Champlain, Ottawa, and Saguenay river
valleys exhibit offsets of the lower Paleozoic rocks on the order of many hundreds of meters
(e.g., Kumarapeli 1985, DuBerger 1991), whereas faulted lower Paleozoic rocks in the
northeastern Lake Ontario region (e.g., Grier 1995) generally exhibit maximum offsets on the
order of several tens of meters. Furthermore, unlike the Ottawa, Saguenay, Champlain, and
St. Lawrence river valleys, the postulated southwesterly extension of the rift system is not
delineated by elevated and persistent seismicity.
3.2.1.4     Iapetan Rifted Margin Source Zone
The Iapetan Rifted Margin (IRM) source zone extends northeast-southwest across the entire
study area and encompasses a terrane of known and inferred normal faults that formed
parallel to the passive margin of Laurentia during the Late Proterozoic-Early Paleozoic opening
of the Iapetus Ocean (e.g., Wheeler 1995, 1996b). Compressional reactivation of favourably
oriented Iapetan faults has been postulated as the causal mechanism for several seismically
active regions in eastern North America, including Charlevoix and the lower St. Lawrence
Valley, Quebec (Adams and Basham 1991); Giles County, Virginia
(Bollinger and Wheeler 1988); and eastern Tennessee (Powell et al. 1994, Wheeler 1995).
Iapetan normal faults likely decrease in size, abundance, and slip gradually and irregularly
northwestward into the North American craton over a distance of perhaps 100 - 200 km
(Bollinger and Wheeler 1988). The northwest boundary to Iapetan normal faults is based on
the northwesternmost locations of known Iapetan faults, both seismic and currently aseismic
(Wheeler 1995). This boundary coincides approximately with the northwestward transition
from a more seismically active continental rim to a generally less active cratonic interior. The
northwestern boundary of the IRM includes the Clarendon-Linden fault system as defined by
Wheeler (1995). The location of the Wheeler (1995) boundary is also reflected in the 2008
update of the U.S. national seismic hazard maps (Petersen et al. 2008).
Milkereit et al. (1992) have suggested that the CMBBZ, which lies approximately 100 km to the
west of the Clarendon-Linden fault system (see Figure 2.21), displays characteristics of an
Iapetan structure. (The CMBBZ is described by O’Dowd et al. [2004] as a 10 to 20 km wide
zone of intense structural deformation within the Grenville orogen of southeastern Canada.) A
Middle to Late Proterozoic half graben imaged from deep seismic reflection data collected across
the CMBBZ in eastern Lake Erie was interpreted to be the result of either pre-Appalachian
(i.e., Iapetan) continental rifting or terminal collapse of the Grenville orogen. This feature
involved extensional reactivation of a gently east-dipping Grenville-age thrust fault in the
CMBBZ, as opposed to cutting discordantly through the gently east-dipping boundary zone
(Milkereit et al. 1992). At the data resolution scale, the seismic data indicate that the lower
Paleozoic sediments overlying this half graben are not significantly deformed
(Milkereit et al. 1992).
In view of the uncertainty associated with the location of the western boundary of the IRM
source zone, we make an assessment of the significance of the IRM/SGR source zone
boundary. Johnston et al. (1994) note that in stable continental regions worldwide,
Precambrian rifts, such as the midcontinent rift system, are considered to be incorporated into
the craton and do not localise seismicity above background seismicity levels. Iapetan rifting
occurred from very late Proterozoic to the earliest Paleozoic (Johnston et al. 1994); thus
Iapetan rifted crust is considered a Paleozoic domain by Johnston et al. (1994).
There is widespread acceptance by the scientific community of the important differences
between rifted (or extended) and nonrifted crust with respect to seismic hazard.
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                        - 72 -                                 March 2011
Johnston et al. (1994) characterised the seismic potential of rifted vs. unrifted crust in eastern
North America using a seismic activity rate normalised to a given unit area of crust. They
concluded that the normalised rates for rifted crust in eastern North America are nearly twice
those of unrifted crust. Worldwide, normalised rates for rifted crust exceed those for unrifted
crust by a factor of 4 at M > 5, increasing to a factor of 8 at M > 6 (Johnston et al. 1994). This
implies that the western boundary of the IRM, and in fact all of the intact Iapetan rifted crust, is
significant in terms of seismic hazard.
Based on the foregoing information, we consider three alternatives for the position of the
northwestern boundary of the IRM source zone: (1) the regional IRM boundary as substantially
defined by Wheeler (1995) and Petersen et al. (2008; see Plate 1a); (2) the CMBBZ as
suggested by Milkereit et al. (1992; Plate 2a); and (3) the western limit of known Iapetan normal
faults in the Adirondack uplift (Plate 3a). For the CMBBZ boundary, two alternatives in the
vicinity of western Lake Erie are considered to be equally credible: (1) a boundary on the west
that is based on the existence of the Mississauga domain as recognised by O’Dowd et al. (2004)
and (2) an eastern boundary that does not include this domain. A low weight (0.1) is assigned to
the CMBBZ’s representing the northwest boundary of Iapetan rifting, based on the following:
    Absence of large-scale, high-angle, down-to-the-east step faults cutting through the gently
     east-dipping Grenville reflectors in the seismic data;
    Thickness (approximately 43 km) of the Grenville crust adjacent to the CMBBZ
     (Zelt et al. 1994, Forsyth et al. 1994a);
    Well-documented occurrences of post-orogenic extension due to collapse in the Grenville
     Orogen within the Canadian Shield (e.g., van der Pluijm and Carlson 1989); and
    Absence of significant early Paleozoic normal slip overlying the half graben imaged in Lake
     Erie.
We assign a weight of 0.5 to the boundary lying along the western flank of the Adirondack
uplift, and a weight of 0.4 to the boundary as defined by Wheeler (1995). The western
Adirondack boundary is given slightly higher weight because it marks the limit of known
Iapetan faults in the Lake Ontario region, and the Clarendon-Linden fault system cannot be
shown unequivocally to be an Iapetan structure.
3.2.1.5     Extended Continental Crust Source Zone
The Extended Continental Crust (ECC) source zone consists of continental crust that most
recently experienced significant extension during Mesozoic rifting associated with the separation
of the North American and African plates (Plate 1a). This zone includes exposed rift basins
along the Atlantic seaboard that are situated landward of the hinge zone of the continental
margin. This region experienced considerably less crustal thinning than did the region seaward
of the hinge zone that includes the deeper marginal sedimentary basins (Klitgord et al. 1988).
The boundaries of this zone generally coincide with the boundaries of the western part of the
Eastern Seaboard Domain as defined by Johnston et al. (1994; see Figure 2.5). This domain
includes Paleozoic basement of part of the eastern United States as well as the eastern
continental shelf. The western boundary of this domain generally follows the western edge of
the Triassic-Jurassic onshore basins or the boundaries of the structural blocks in which they
occur (Klitgord et al. (1988). As shown by Johnston et al. (1994), this zone also includes
Paleozoic basins in the northern Appalachians that resulted from post-Acadian transtensional
deformation.
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                       - 73 -                                   March 2011
The eastern boundary of this zone is defined by a basement hinge zone that separates shallow
platforms from deep marginal sedimentary basins in a series of parallel half graben structures
that deepen seaward. At the hinge zone, basement deepens steeply to the east by a series of
down-dropped fault blocks from about 2 to 4 km depth to over 8 km depth
(Klitgord et al. 1988). The character of block faulting at the hinge zone varies along the margin
and may reflect the influence of older crustal structure on the Mesozoic rifting
(Klitgord et al. 1988). Half graben structures with seaward-dipping border faults are observed
at the Georges Bank hinge zone, whereas faulted blocks with landward-dipping faults form the
hinge zone in the Baltimore Canyon trough (Klitgord et al. 1988, Trehu et al. 1989).
Seismicity within the ECC source zone is not randomly distributed, but tends to be clustered
with intervening areas exhibiting low seismicity. The largest historical events within this zone
are the earthquakes of 1755 (Cape Ann, M ~ 6.2), 1884 (Rockaway Beach/New York City,
body-wave magnitude mb = 5.2), and 1737 (New York City, mb = 5.2).
3.2.1.6     Northern Appalachians Source Zone
The Northern Appalachians (NAZ) source zone consists of a variety of Paleozoic terranes
assembled in the Taconic, Salinian, and Acadian orogenies and deformed by these events and
the subsequent Alleghenian orogeny, opening of the Atlantic Ocean, and the Great Meteor
Hotspot (see Table 2.1). Normal faulting in the late stages of the Salinian orogeny
(Tremblay and Castonguay 2002), extensional reactivation of the Ammonoosuc Fault in the
Mesozoic (Moench and Aleinikoff 2003), and the Norembega fault zone in the Late Cretaceous
(West and Roden-Tice 2003) indicate that this zone has experienced multiple phases of
extension. The Northern Appalachians is a separate tectonic block built in the Taconic and
Acadian orogenies, separately from the central and southern Appalachians and is therefore
separated from the ECC source zone. The terranes of the Northern Appalachians overrode the
Iapetan passive margin along an east-dipping zone of detachment (Grenvillian ramp), seen as a
major lateral velocity change that reaches a depth of about 25 km in the source zone
(Hughes and Luetgert 1991). This structure has not been identified as a source of recorded
seismicity. As noted by Adams et al. (1995), all earthquakes in this zone with known depths are
relatively shallow (less than 10 km).
3.2.1.7     Great Meteor Hotspot Source Zone
The Great Meteor Hotspot (GMH) source zone is adopted from the Gatineau (GAT) source
zone of the GSC (Adams et al. 1996, Adams and Halchuck 2003). Adams and Basham (1991)
have suggested that the band of seismicity north of the Ottawa River within the Western
Quebec seismic zone is due to crustal fractures that formed as the North American plate rode
over a Cretaceous hotspot (Crough 1981). As discussed in Section 2.2.15, various
interpretations exist regarding the role of the hotspot and its role in Late Cretaceous extension.
Regardless of the exact timing and mechanism, the hotspot track continues to influence rates of
seismicity. The GMH has been associated with clusters of midcrustal seismicity by
Ma and Eaton (2007). Ma and Atkinson (2006) attribute the wide hypocentral depth distribution
(2 - 25 km) for events in the western Quebec seismic zone to faults of through-going crustal
extent or of varying depths in the crust and note that the clustering of focal depths at 5, 8, 12, 15
and 22 km and may reflect layering in seismogenic properties within the crust. Subsequent work
by Ma and Eaton (2007) noted that shallow events with depths less than 8 km are randomly
distributed with reverse mechanisms attributed to glacial isostatic adjustment, earthquakes with
intermediate depths define a linear band of earthquakes, and deep earthquakes (greater than
17 km in depth) are localized as clusters at Timiskaming, Maniwaki, Mont Laurier, and
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                          - 74 -                                March 2011
Adirondack. Crustal thickness maps derived by Eaton et al. (2006) from teleseismic analysis
and results of regional seismic refraction surveys image the hotspot track northeast of the
Ottawa-Bonnechere graben as minima on these maps. The thinnest crust (34.5 - 37.0 km)
coincides with the elevated seismicity rates of the Western Quebec seismic zone, northeast of
the Ottawa Bonnechere graben. These observations led Ma and Eaton (2007) to propose that
the Western Quebec seismic zone represents blind intrusions associated with entrapment of
mantle-derived melt in the crust between the area emplaced with kimberlitic dikes and the
Monteregian intrusions.
3.2.2     Seismicity-Based Source Zones
A second approach to defining regional source zones is to delineate areas with relatively
uniform seismicity. Seismic hazard maps for Canada and adjacent parts of the United States
were prepared by the Geological Survey of Canada as part of the Canadian National
Earthquake Hazards Program (Adams and Halchuk 2003). Both aleatory and epistemic
uncertainties are incorporated into the new maps, the fourth generation of seismic hazard
maps of Canada. For eastern Canada, two models are used in Adams and Halchuk (2003).
The H model uses relatively small source zones drawn around historical seismicity clusters,
and the R model establishes larger, regional source zones. Since the tectonic elements used
to develop the R model are all considered in the geologic/tectonic source zones described
above, only the H model is used in this study (Plate 25). In this model, the seismicity zones
represent areas of uniform seismicity rate. Smaller zones are drawn about small clusters and
larger zones are drawn about more elongated clusters of seismicity. Some consideration is
given to geology and tectonics in connecting individual centers of clustered seismicity along
the axis of the St. Lawrence rift and Ottawa graben.
3.2.3     Zoneless Model of Seismicity-Based Source Zones
The zoneless approach is based on a similar concept to the seismicity based model
(Section 3.2.2): the pattern of recorded seismicity is the single most important factor controlling
the rate and spatial distribution of future earthquakes in the region. The difference is that
instead of defining zones of uniform seismicity (i.e., small zones of higher seismic activity
embedded in large zones of lower activity), a nonparametric spatial smoothing process is used
to define the spatial variation of activity rate (a-value) and b-value over the entire region. The
methodology was developed by EPRI (1988) and was used to assess earthquake catalogue
completeness in Section 2.5.4. The region is divided into cells of one degree longitude and
latitude. The seismicity parameters (a- and b-value) for each cell are estimated from the
earthquakes that have occurred within the cell using a penalised likelihood methodology that
imposes a degree of smooth variation across the entire region.
The penalised likelihood approach compares the seismicity parameters estimated in a cell with
the average of the parameters in the neighbouring cells. Large changes in the rate of activity
or b-value compared to the neighbouring cells require a large amount of data within the cell.
Cells with little data receive seismicity parameters that are similar to those in the neighbouring
cells. The zoneless model developed for the Bruce nuclear PSHA covers the region shown on
Plate 26. A low degree of smoothing (small penalty function) was applied to the a-value,
allowing for rapid changes in seismicity rates across the region. A greater degree of
smoothing was applied to the b-value estimation, reflecting the concept that large changes in
b-value are not expected with stable continental regions.

3.3        Local Seismic Sources
Two local seismic sources are potentially active within a 100 km radius of the Bruce nuclear site:
the GFTZ and the Georgian Bay linear zone (GBLZ) (see Figure 2.21). Five additional seismic
sources more than 100 km distant from the Bruce nuclear are also included in the seismic
hazard analysis. The characteristics of these sources are described below and alternative
geometries are shown on Plates 27 and 28. Some of these sources have a very low assessed
probability of activity and, therefore, minimal influence on seismic hazard in the Bruce nuclear
site region. However, each of these local sources has been identified as being potentially
significant by other researchers and therefore is included in the PSHA for completeness.
3.3.1      Seismogenic Potential
A key uncertainty in the assessment of local features is whether individual faults, lineaments,
and other interpreted tectonic features are seismogenic. Seismogenic in this context is defined
as capable of generating moderate-to-large earthquakes (MN > 5). Uncertainty in this
assessment, which is specific to each local seismic source, is represented by the relative
probabilities on the yes and no branches of the logic tree. In the hazard analysis, the “yes”
branch means that the fault or lineament will be treated as a source that localises seismicity;
the “no” branch means that the fault or lineament will not localise seismicity above the levels of
the regional source zone within which it lies. In all cases, the regional seismic source zones
are assumed to be seismogenic with a probability of 1.0. This is because the regional sources
include a large region spatially and likely include at least one fault (although unknown) capable
of generating an M > 5 earthquake. Because the regional sources exist everywhere in the
study region, there is a finite potential for earthquake occurrence everywhere in the study
region. The definition of local sources can, therefore, include the manner in which future
seismicity might be localised along particular tectonic features. The probability that any given
tectonic feature is seismogenic varies as a function of evidence for its activity, as discussed
below.
The approach used in this analysis to quantify explicitly the probability of being seismogenic is
essentially the same as that used for the EPRI seismic hazard analysis for the eastern United
States (EPRI 1988). The assessment follows three basic steps:
    Identify diagnostic criteria for assessing seismogenic potential and evaluating their relative
     value;
    Evaluate individual tectonic features relative to the criteria; and
    Combine the feature-specific evaluation of the criteria with the relative value of the criteria
     to arrive at the probability that the tectonic feature is seismogenic (note that in the EPRI
     study, this was termed the “probability of activity”).
Below, we first define and rate the criteria, followed by a discussion of the procedure for
evaluating the probability of being seismogenic. This is followed by the evaluation of the
seismic potential of local sources.
3.3.1.1     Criteria for Assessing Seismogenic Potential
Given the importance of this component of the source characterization to the hazard analysis,
it is useful to define explicitly the criteria that are used to assess whether a tectonic feature or
lineament is seismogenic, and to define the relative value that each criterion has in making the
evaluation. “Relative value,” in this sense, is an expression of the resolving power that a
particular criterion - and its associated data - has in determining whether a tectonic feature is
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                          - 76 -                                  March 2011
seismogenic. A criterion that provides a high resolving power (i.e., provides a strong indication
that a feature is seismogenic) is therefore assigned a high relative weight. For example, if a
tectonic feature is spatially associated with several MN > 5 earthquakes in the historical record,
it would have a high potential for being seismogenic (that is, capable of generating MN >5
earthquakes in the future). Some criteria may be less diagnostic and have a relatively low
resolving power for determining whether a tectonic feature is seismogenic. An example of
such a criterion might be evidence that the tectonic feature has undergone multiple episodes of
reactivation during its geologic history. Studies of earthquake occurrence within stable
continental regions worldwide have suggested that observed moderate-to-large earthquakes
commonly have been associated with multiply reactivated structures (Johnston et al. 1994).
However, these studies also have concluded that there are many more such tectonic features
not associated with observed earthquakes than ones that are associated, suggesting that this
is not an effective diagnostic criterion.
The criteria discussed below are judged to be diagnostic types of information that would
indicate whether a fault is capable of generating MN > 5 earthquakes in the future. These
criteria are best suited for potential sources with unclear evidence of activity, but would not be
used if certain evidence is well documented. For example, if a fault has been causally (not just
spatially) associated with large-magnitude historical earthquakes or shows unequivocal
evidence of repeated late Quaternary displacements (as would an active fault in a
plate-boundary tectonic setting), then that fault would be considered seismogenic with a
probability of 1.0. If, however, these most diagnostic criteria are not present for a particular
tectonic feature, then there exist uncertainties in the seismogenic potential of that feature. This
uncertainty is expressed by the probability that the feature is seismogenic and will be less
than 1.0. The criteria and their relative diagnostic value are explained below.
Spatial Association with MN > 5 Seismicity
The first criterion is the spatial association of a tectonic feature (e.g., fault or lineament) with
observed moderate-to-large earthquakes that have occurred historically or during the
instrumental period. Note that this is not a causal association (which would clearly indicate
that the feature is seismogenic), but merely the spatial distribution of observed earthquakes
relative to the feature of interest. We define spatial association as being an alignment of
seismicity along the length of a substantial portion of a given feature (i.e., a fault or lineament).
For general application, the spatial association is made in two dimensions only (map view)
because reliable hypocenter data are not generally available. Uncertainties associated with
this criterion stem from the fact that, in low-activity environments, the historical record is short
relative to the recurrence intervals of large earthquakes. As a result, the occurrence of only a
single historical event or the absence of large observed events is not uncommon. In addition,
it is difficult to associate older historical events with a particular feature because of
uncertainties in epicenter location; sometimes even instrumentally located events are not
easily associated with known faults. If available, other information, including focal depth and
focal mechanisms, is considered in the final assessment of the seismogenic potential of a
given feature. This is applied on a case-by-case basis because these data generally are not
available for most of the features being considered in this analysis. (See the discussion below
on using feature-specific data sets to “update” the assessment of seismogenic potential.)
Spatial Association with MN < 5 Seismicity
The second criterion is the spatial association of a tectonic feature with small-magnitude
(2 > MN <5) seismicity. Again, we define spatial association as an alignment of seismicity
along the length of a substantial portion of a given tectonic feature. It is common for
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                        - 77 -                                  March 2011
seismogenic faults to be associated with small-magnitude seismicity; however, the association
of a fault or lineament with such events does not necessarily indicate that the feature can also
generate larger events.
To illustrate the notion of a “spatial association” of seismicity with a tectonic feature, we
present on Figure 3.4 a range of assessments for an idealised linear tectonic feature and
idealised “observed” seismicity. The feature C displays a clear association with seismicity
aligned along its entire length. In this example the trend in the seismicity is consistent with the
trend of the feature, and the feature is assessed to be spatially associated with seismicity with
a probability of 1.0. In the example, both historical and instrumental events are present,
suggesting persistence through time and little chance that the spatial association with older
historical events is merely a matter of the coincidence of poor locations. The feature A on
Figure 3.4 has a single recorded event in close proximity to it, and although other earthquakes
occur in its vicinity, they show no tendency to align themselves along the feature. Thus feature
A on Figure 3.4 is assessed to have a low probability (0.1) of spatial association with
seismicity.
                  Figure 3.4: Examples of Spatial Association with Seismicity
The other example presented on Figure 3.4 further illustrates the definition of spatial
association. Seismicity in the vicinity of feature B on Figure 3.4 occurs primarily near one end.
This cluster, however, is part of a trend of seismicity that is perpendicular to the feature and
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                         - 78 -                                  March 2011
extends away from the feature. Seismicity that occurs near the remaining portion of the
feature is scattered and cannot be distinguished from random background activity. This
feature is assessed to have a probability of 0.2 of being spatially associated with seismicity
because the trend in the seismicity is not consistent with the trend of the feature.
For two or more features that are proximal to one another, or that intersect, we assume that
the seismicity in their vicinity can be associated with any of the features, i.e., a single
seismicity cluster that is proximal to, say, three features is considered in the individual
assessments of each of the features.
Multiple Episodes of Reactivation
The third criterion is geologic evidence for multiple episodes of reactivation. A fault that
exhibits evidence for brittle slip during distinctly different geologic time periods/tectonic phases
might be an indication that that structure is a persistent zone of weakness in the crust. For
example, in their global study of the association of M > 4.5 earthquakes with various tectonic
features, Johnston et al. (1994) found that several of the moderate-to-large earthquakes that
have occurred in stable continental regions have been associated with intracratonic rifts that
have experienced multiple episodes of reactivation. Admittedly, however, they also found that
there are many rifts displaying such evidence of reactivation that have not been associated
with seismicity. Uncertainties in applying this criterion arise from the lack of, or uncertainties
in, crosscutting relationships of brittle structures and recognizing different types of cogenetic
displacement (e.g., normal faults in the hanging wall of a thrust fault). A structure reactivated
in the present-day northeast-southwest-oriented compressional stress field would also show
evidence of activation during a previous phase of deformation.
Brittle Slip in Present Stress Regime
The fourth criterion is geologic evidence for brittle slip that is kinematically consistent with the
present tectonic stress regime. Clearly, faults and other features associated with ductile
deformation reflect a deformation episode that occurred at a tectonic level below the
seismogenic zone of the crust. Therefore, we are only considering tectonic features
associated with brittle deformation. We consider compressional deformation, i.e., strike-slip,
reverse, or oblique reverse faulting, to be an indication of slip within the present-day regional
stress field. Further, we assume that the axis of maximum horizontal compression is in the
northeastern quadrant in the study region. Seismogenic faults, by definition, are favourably
oriented relative to tectonic stresses because earthquakes are a manifestation of the release
of tectonic stresses. However, in the absence of other evidence, determination of how
favourably a fault is oriented involves knowledge of the three-dimensional geometry of the
fault, the orientations of the principle stress directions, and the rheological properties of the
rocks (Zoback 1992).
Crustal Extent
Because of the rupture dimensions associated with large earthquakes, most seismogenic
faults extend through the seismogenic crust (i.e., depths of 10 – 20 km). The fifth criterion
expresses the degree to which knowledge of the downdip crustal extent of a fault provides an
indication of whether it is seismogenic. Evidence for expression in the deep crust might
include large geophysical anomalies and gradients, the identification of a feature in deep
seismic data, and geologic/tectonic interpretations of the role that a tectonic feature represents
(e.g., continental rift faults). Crustal-scale extent is not considered an exclusively sufficient
condition for assessing seismogenic potential. That is, seismogenic tectonic features would be
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                        - 79 -                                March 2011
expected to extend to seismogenic depths, but the mere fact that a feature extends to these
depths does not provide much assurance that it is in fact seismogenic. This conclusion is
supported in many geologic environments, such as in much of the eastern United States,
where abundant, large, crustal-scale faults exist, but relatively few are believed to be
seismogenic. These features are merely the vestiges of previous tectonic deformation
episodes.
3.3.1.2     Additional Criteria
The criteria discussed above generally are applicable to the tectonic features in the Bruce
nuclear site region because of the available databases. However, additional data of potential
use to the evaluation of seismogenic potential may be available locally if special studies have
been conducted. For example, local seismic networks may provide information on the spatial
distribution of microseismicity (MN < 2), or geologic studies may identify evidence for
geologically recent faulting or evidence for paleoseismic shaking (e.g., paleoliquefaction
evidence). These observations, although not generally applicable to all local sources, are
important to certain local sources and must be taken into account in arriving at the probability
of the feature’s being seismogenic. The additional criteria are discussed here, and the
procedure for “updating” the assessment to include feature-specific additional data is
discussed in the following section.
As defined above, the criteria for “spatial association with seismicity” are based on a
two-dimensional (map view) association between observed seismicity and the tectonic feature.
In some cases, additional seismologic data may exist that could affect the assessment. These
data include information on the hypocentral distribution (such that the three-dimensional
geometry of the feature can be correlated with seismicity or the crustal extent of the feature
assessed); focal mechanisms that indicate whether the orientation of the focal planes is
consistent with the feature of interest; stress tensors that may or may not be consistent with
the kinematic indicators on the feature of interest; the spatial pattern of microseismicity
(MN < 2); and the spatial pattern of aftershock sequences that define the geometry of
coseismic rupture planes.
An additional consideration is geologic evidence for Quaternary tectonic displacement. The
Quaternary geologic record spans a much longer period than the historical record, and
typically includes evidence of large earthquakes that rupture the surface. In plate-boundary
tectonic environments, this criterion is the primary means of assessing whether particular faults
are active. Uncertainties in using this criterion in eastern North America come from
uncertainties in dating the age of slip and discerning whether displacements are tectonic or
other in origin. Given the common occurrence of geologically young glacial features and
postglacial pop-up structures in the Great Lakes region, the identification of young tectonic
deformation requires considerable care. In evaluating this criterion for a given fault or
lineament, we consider both the geologic evidence for recency of deformation associated with
that feature, and the likelihood that the evidence represents seismotectonic or other
deformation.
3.3.1.3     Procedure for Calculating Probability of Being Seismogenic
The diagnostic value of the five seismogenic criteria is shown in Table 3.1 in terms of the
conditional probability that a feature is seismogenic given a specific set of observations. The
table is laid out in the form of a matrix containing the 32 possible combinations of observing
the criteria or lack of criteria when considering a specific tectonic feature. Each box in the
matrix represents one possible set of observations for a tectonic feature. The number in the
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                        - 80 -                                   March 2011
box represents the conditional probability that the feature is seismogenic given the specific set
of observations. The table is arranged such that the upper left-hand corner is the most
favourable case for the feature’s being seismogenic (i.e., all five criteria are observed), and the
lower right-hand corner is the least favourable case for the feature’s being seismogenic (i.e., all
of the criteria are observed to be absent). The criteria are arranged in order of decreasing
diagnostic ability from left to right and from top to bottom.

The procedure used to assess the conditional probabilities is to first assess the values at the
extremes (i.e., the four corners). For example, in the case where all of the criteria are
observed to apply with certainty to a given feature (upper left-hand corner), the probability that
these observations indicate that the feature is seismogenic is judged to be very high (0.95).
The reason it is not certainty (1.0) stems from the fact that these observations do not
demonstrate unequivocally a causal relationship between the feature and earthquakes. In the
case where none of the three geologic criteria are observed for a given feature, yet the feature
is spatially associated unequivocally with both large- and small-magnitude seismicity (upper
right-hand corner), the probability that the feature is seismogenic is also judged to be very high
(0.85).
The bottom row of the matrix in Table 3.1 contains the cases where no spatial association of a
tectonic feature with small-magnitude or moderate-to-large earthquakes is observed. The
lower right-hand corner is the case where none of the geologic criteria are observed to be
present. In this instance, it is judged very unlikely (probability <0.001) that the feature is a
localiser of seismicity. Again, the probability is not set to certainty (0) because of our imperfect
knowledge of the processes controlling the occurrence of earthquakes in eastern North
America. In the case where a feature exhibits unequivocally all of the geologic criteria but
shows no spatial association with earthquakes (lower left-hand box), the probability of the
feature’s being seismogenic is judged to be only 0.1. This probability reflects our judgment
that, in the low-strain tectonic environment of eastern North America, the geologic criteria
alone are not strong indicators of the potential of a feature to generate future earthquakes.
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                         - 81 -                                March 2011
This is indirectly supported by the widespread occurrence of known geologic structures in the
region that have not been associated with historical or instrumental seismicity.
The next stage in assessing the conditional probabilities of being seismogenic is to consider
the relative importance of adding (or subtracting) the observation of one of the criteria.
Considering the top row of Table 3.1 (spatial association of both moderate-to-large and small
earthquakes with a feature), the diagnostic power of observing that the feature has deep
crustal extent (an increase in conditional probability from 0.85 to 0.87) is judged to be less than
the diagnostic power of observing brittle slip (an increase in conditional probability from 0.85 to
0.90), and the diagnostic power of observing multiple reactivations is judged to be greater (an
increase in conditional probability from 0.85 to 0.92). Deep crustal extent is judged to be the
least diagnostic of the three geologic criteria because some moderate-sized earthquakes have
occurred in stable continental crust at depths shallower than 10 km. An example is the 1986
magnitude 5 Leroy, Ohio, earthquake, which occurred at a depth of about 6 km in Precambrian
basement rocks (Seeber and Armbruster 1993). The same relative importance of the three
geologic criteria is used to complete the assessments for the top row and to assess the
intermediate conditional probabilities along the bottom row.
The left-hand and right-hand columns illustrate the relative importance of observed spatial
association with moderate-to-large and small-magnitude seismicity. The assigned conditional
probabilities reflect the judgment that a spatial association with moderate-to-large seismicity is
more important than a spatial association with small-magnitude seismicity. The assigned
probabilities also signify our judgment that spatial association with seismicity is much more
diagnostic of seismic potential than the three geologic criteria. The remaining conditional
probabilities within the interior of Table 3.1 were assigned by interpolating between values
along the table margins.
The evaluation of the probability that an individual feature is seismogenic is performed by
assessing the degree to which each of the five criteria is judged to apply. For example, the
following list shows the assessments for a hypothetical feature.
Criterion:                                  Probability:
Association MN > 5                          0.1
Association MN < 5                          0.4
Multiple reactivation                       0.3
Brittle slip                                0.6
Crustal extent                              0.7
Probability of being seismogenic            0.29
The five probabilities listed above indicate the degree to which each criterion is judged to apply
to the feature. These probabilities provide a basis for assigning the likelihood that the
observed criteria match one of the 32 possible conditions in Table 3.1. The calculation
procedure is illustrated in Table 3.2. Each of the five criteria has two possible states: being
observed to apply (yes) or being observed not to apply (no). The probabilities listed above are
the probabilities that each criterion is observed (yes), as indicated in Table 3.2. One minus
these values equals the probabilities that the criteria are not observed. Assuming that the
probabilities assigned to observing the five criteria are independent, then the joint probability of
a particular set of observed criteria is obtained by multiplying the five individual probabilities.
For example, the likelihood that all five criteria are observed is 0.1×0.4×0.3×0.6×0.7 = 0.0050
(first row of Table 3.2), and the likelihood that none of the criteria are observed is
(1 0.1)×(1 0.4)×(1-0.3)×(1–0.6)×(1–0.7) = 0.0454 (last row of Table 3.2). The unconditional

assessment of the probability that the feature is seismogenic is made by multiplying the
likelihood that a particular set of criteria is observed by the conditional probability that the
feature is seismogenic (Table 3.1) and summing the result over all 32 possible sets of
observations (last column of Table 3.2). The result for the example feature is 0.29.
By disaggregating the assessment this way into its component parts, the technical basis for the
assessment is made clear. It should be noted, however, that although the assessment is
made more explicit by dissecting it into its component parts, the assessment of the probability
of the feature’s being seismogenic is still one that involves professional judgment. The
technical basis for the assessments is given for each feature in the following section.
As discussed above, in some cases additional data may exist for certain tectonic features
(e.g., focal mechanisms, geologic evidence for Quaternary tectonic slip). In those cases, the
probability of being seismogenic that is calculated for the feature—based on the five general
criteria—is “updated” to account for the additional information. For example, in the example
given above, the tectonic feature is assessed to have a probability of 0.29 of being
seismogenic based on the five general criteria. Suppose that, in addition, a local seismic
network has shown that microseismicity is aligned along a significant portion of the tectonic
feature, and focal mechanisms for several earthquakes in proximity to the feature indicate that
one nodal plane is parallel to the feature. This additional information would lend further
support to the seismogenic potential of the feature. The additional criteria are used in a formal
Bayesian update of the probability that the feature is seismogenic. The probability of 0.29
assessed from the five primary criteria is considered the “prior” assessment, P ' ( S ) . The
“posterior” probability, P ' ' ( S C ) , given the observation of criteria, C, is given by Bayes’s
Theorem:
                                                             P (C S )  P ' ( S )
                                    P' ' (S C ) 
                                                   P (C S )  P ' ( S )  P (C S )  P ' ( S )
                                                                                                                     (3.1)
where P (C S ) is the likelihood (probability) of observing criteria C given that the feature is
seismogenic, P (C S ) is the likelihood of observing criteria C given that the feature is not
seismogenic, and P (S ) is the prior probability that the feature is not seismogenic

If the relative likelihood of observing a criterion when a feature is seismogenic compared to
when it is not is defined as RL (C )  P (C S ) / P (C S ) , then Equation (3.1) can be rewritten as
                                                       RL (C )  P ' ( S )
                                  P' ' (S C ) 
                                                RL (C )  P ' ( S )  {1  P ( S )}                    (3.2)
If one judges that it is twice as likely that the criteria will be observed for a seismogenic feature
as for a nonseismogenic feature, then P"(SC) = (20.29)/(20.29+[1–0.29]) = 0.45. It should
be noted that the use of Equation (3.2) assumes that the probability of observing the additional
criteria, given that the feature is not active, is not zero; that is, the additional criteria are not
perfectly diagnostic. If they were, then P(CS) would equal zero and the posterior probability
would be 1.0 by Equation (3.1).

 3.3.2      Grenville Front Tectonic Zone
 The Grenville Front tectonic zone (GFTZ) marks the boundary between the weakly deformed
 rocks of the Superior structural province (age 2.5 gigayears, or Gyr) and the highly deformed,
 much younger rocks of the Grenville province (age 1.0 Gyr; Mereu et al. 1986). The Grenville
 Front is a major tectonic feature exposed on the Canadian Shield and has a length of
 approximately 1,900 km. Evidence has been presented that suggests the Grenville Front was
 a result of a continent-to-continent collision process (Mereu et al. 1986). Geophysical and
 geologic data indicate that the Grenville Front is highly variable in its character along the length
 of the orogen (Kellett et al. 1994).
 Aeromagnetic lineaments in southern Ontario were mapped by Boyce and Morris (2002) using
 an image-enhanced first vertical derivative map (see Figure 2.23). The GFTZ is one of several
 major northeast-trending aeromagnetic lineaments that record the presence of a Grenville-age
 terrane boundary. Other prominent northeast-trending lineaments recognised include the
 Erie-Georgian Bay lineament (located about 100 km to the east of the Bruce nuclear site) and
 the Niagara-Pickering linear zone that crosses the western end of Lake Ontario.
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                         - 86 -                                  March 2011
Carr et al. (2000) examined a geologic transect across the Grenville orogen in southern
Ontario and New York using seismic reflection and geologic data. They described the GFTZ
as the northwest limit of Grenvillian brittle-ductile deformation and an area of ductile thrusting
from 1,020 to 980 Ma. The GFTZ may have been part of a compressional system that rooted
in the mid-lower crust. Subsequently, the area cooled and was exhumed and overprinted by
younger faults up until about 600 Ma.
An analysis involving seismic refraction tomography and data from the 1992 Lithoprobe
Abitibi-Grenville Seismic Refraction Experiment was conducted by Winardhi and Mereu (1997).
Their work provided constraints on the crustal thickness and the nature of the crust-mantle
transition across the Grenville Front in the region directly to the northeast of Lake Huron. The
GFTZ is imaged as a southeast-dipping region of anomalous velocity gradients that extend
down to the Moho. The character of the Moho varies from a sharp discontinuity south of the
Grenville Front to a more diffuse transitional boundary to the north of the front. The Moho
depth is shallowest (34 km) on the north side of the exposed Grenville Front and is generally
deeper (39 – 43 km) to the south; also, the crust to the south of the front is 4 - 5 km thicker
than that to the north.
A seismic reflection line approximately 300 km long was located perpendicular to the Grenville
Front north of Lake Ontario as part of 1982 experiments by COCRUST (Mereu et al. 1986).
Results from the survey indicate a change in the character of the velocity gradient within the
crust, as well as significant thickening of the crust by at least 5 km at depth in the vicinity of the
Grenville Front. GLIMPCE deep seismic reflection data included an east-west-trending profile
across Lake Huron and Georgian Bay (Green et al. 1988). This line shows evidence for a
major crustal shear zone along the Grenville Front.
The deep structure of the Grenville Front in western Quebec was examined by
Kellet et al. (1994) using line 15 of the Lithoprobe Abitibi-Grenville transects, integrated with
aeromagnetic, magnetotelluric, and geologic mapping data. Kellet et al. (1994) compared the
characteristics of the Grenville Front in their study area with the results of the studies using
deep seismic reflection data across the front in central Ontario (GLIMPCE line, described by
Green et al. [1988]), and central Ohio (COCORP line, described by Culotta et al. [1990], also
above). The crustal structures revealed by each of these profiles were quite different, and
Kellet et al. (1994) therefore state that the Grenville Front is highly variable in its character
along the orogen.
Seismogenic Potential: The following table summarises the assessment of the seismogenic
potential of the Grenville Front tectonic lineament. The individual assessments are listed
below.
Criterion:                                     Probability:
Association with MN ≥ 5 seismicity             0
Association with 2 ≤ MN < 5 seismicity         0
Evidence for reactivation                      0.2
Slip favourable w/present stress regime        0.1
Seismogenic crustal extent                     1
Probability of being seismogenic               0.01
There are no earthquakes having magnitudes greater than 5 within more than 250 km of the
GFTZ; therefore, a probability of zero is assigned to the GFTZ associated with this level of
seismicity. The level of small-magnitude seismicity within about 100 km of the feature is
extremely low. Near the south end of the Erie-Huron linear zone (see Figure 2.23), a cluster of
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                         - 87 -                                   March 2011
earthquakes was recorded that Boyce and Morris (2002) interpret as coincident with the
west-east-trending Electric fault (see Figure 2.21). However, Boyce and Morris (2002) note
that the earthquake cluster is likely to be artificially induced, as the Electric fault system is
associated with several producing oil and gas fields. Based on the lack of an alignment of
seismicity associated with the GFTZ, a probability of zero is assigned to the criteria of
association with small-magnitude seismicity.
The Grenville Front is described by Carr et al. (2000) as likely originating from ca. 1,000 Ma
thrust fault that was overprinted by younger faults up until about 600 Ma. Multiple episodes of
reactivation along the GFTZ have not been identified in southern Ontario. Where the GFTZ
extends into the subsurface of Ohio, however, a younger fault with recurrent displacement
through the latest Silurian is recognised. The recurring displacement on the Bowling Green
fault is attributed by Onasch and Kahle (1991) to the GFTZ, which served to localise the
release of stress in the craton.
The Bowling Green fault has been mapped in the subsurface of Ohio and Michigan. The fault
is approximately 190 km in length and has three recognised segments (the northern segment
is also known as the Lucas-Monroe monocline/fault). The central segment of the Bowling
Green fault is well studied because of quarry exposures and is essentially coincident with the
GFTZ and the Findlay Arch (see Figure 2.3). The fault displaces the Precambrian
unconformity surface west-side-down (Baranoski 2002) and has had at least six episodes of
displacement through the Middle Silurian (Hauser 1996). As exposed in the Waterville quarry
in southern Lucas County, the fault is a 10 m wide near-vertical zone of highly sheared rock
striking N10° to 20°W, with secondary faulting extending out 10 – 90 m on either side
(Onasch and Kahle 1991). Onasch and Kahle (1991) speculate that adjacent fault-parallel,
east-dipping thrust faults having maximum displacements of less than 5 m are consistent with
the contemporary stress field, and if related to contemporary stresses, the Bowling Green fault
is Late Cretaceous or younger. Onasch and Kahle (1991) suggest that the location of the fault
and recurrent displacement through latest Silurian on the fault are controlled by the Grenville
Front and Paleozoic orogenic activity to the east, including possibly the Carboniferous to
Permian Alleghenian event. Based on these data, a weight of 0.2 is assigned to the criteria of
geologic evidence for multiple episodes of reactivation.
There is no documented evidence for Quaternary deformation on the Bowling Green fault.
Given the evidence for possible post-Alleghenian thrust faulting, however, the possibility that
the fault—and consequently the GFTZ—is active cannot be ruled out. Therefore, the geologic
evidence for brittle slip in the present tectonic stress regime is assigned a weight of 0.1.
Deep seismic reflection and refraction profile data clearly indicate that the GFTZ extends down
to the Moho (Winardhi and Mereu 1997, Mereu et al. 1986, Kellett et al. 1994). Given this
deep crustal structure, a very high probability (1.0) is assigned to the GFTZ’s extending to
seismogenic depths.
Given the assessments above, the probability that the GFTZ is seismogenic is 0.01.
3.3.3      Georgian Bay Linear Zone
The Georgian Bay linear zone (GBLZ) was identified by Wallach and Mohajer (1990) on the
basis of parallel, discontinuous, linear aeromagnetic, and gravity anomalies. The feature is an
approximately 50 km wide zone extending from the northeast corner of Georgian Bay to
possibly as far south as western New York state (see Figure 2.22). The linear zone is
approximately coincident with the straight east coast of Georgian Bay. Wallach (1990)
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                         - 88 -                                 March 2011
interpreted the differently expressed lineaments of the GBLZ as a major Precambrian
structural zone. The location of the GBLZ can be interpreted on the GLIMPCE line J seismic
reflection profile between shots 700 and 1000. At this approximate location,
Green et al. (1988) imaged strong, east-dipping reflections to depths of approximately 30 km.
These reflections coincide with the wide belt of ductile strain associated with the GFTZ as it
deepens to the east (Green et al. 1988). A physiographic lineament along the trend of the
GBLZ was interpreted by Sanford et al. (1985) as a fault block boundary, tectonically active at
least during the early Paleozoic. The Laurentian channel, a pre-glacial outlet of the upper
Great Lakes to the St. Lawrence River (Eyles et al. 1993), also lies along the trend of the
GBLZ.
Based on interpretations of aeromagnetic and gravity data in southern Ontario, Roest (1995)
reported the existence of the GBLZ to be very questionable. Using an image-enhanced first
vertical derivative map, however, Boyce and Morris (2002) mapped aeromagnetic lineaments
in the region and identified the GBLZ as the most prominent northwest magnetic trend in the
region. Boyce and Morris (2002) noted that first vertical derivative filtering significantly
improves the resolution of this feature, although they also state that the northwest-trending
lineaments are generally lower in amplitude and less prominent than northeast-trending
lineaments. The origin of the northwest-trending magnetic boundaries such as the GBLZ is not
well established but may record extension into the midcontinent of transform faults formed
initially during Iapetan rifting. Boyce and Morris (2002) show the GBLZ as extending from
Georgian Bay to north of Lake Ontario, where it appears to be truncated by the
Niagara-Pickering lineament northwest of Pickering.
Wallach and Mohajer (1990) reported that a zone of earthquakes trending north-northwest
extends from western New York State to near the northeast corner of Georgian Bay and
outlines a linear belt that lies within and parallels the elements of the GBLZ. Among these
earthquakes are the 1857 Lockport event (~M 5.0), which has since been relocated southwest
of Buffalo and downgraded to M ~ 4, and the 1929 Attica event (mb 5.2), which occurred near
the intersection of the GBLZ and the Clarendon-Linden fault system. Two mesoscopic brittle
faults observed in lower Paleozoic rocks in the vicinity of the GBLZ are thought to be
associated with this feature (Wallach and Mohajer 1990). These faults are oriented
approximately parallel to the zone and have normal displacement, with one dipping 75 degrees
northeast and the other dipping 75 degrees southwest (Wallach and Mohajer 1990).
Seismogenic Potential: There are uncertainties associated with whether the GBLZ extends
south into the subsurface below Lake Ontario. Because whether the linear zone is truncated
affects the assessment of seismogenic potential, two separate assessments are made for the
GBLZ: (1) the linear zone is truncated by the Niagara-Pickering lineament to the north of Lake
Ontario, and (2) the linear zone extends south into New York. Based on the available data,
particularly the work of Boyce and Morris (2002), we consider the likelihood that the GBLZ is
truncated to be twice that of the alternative that it extends into New York State.
The following lists summarise the assessments of the seismogenic potential of the GBLZ. The
individual assessments are discussed below.
Assuming truncation at the Niagara-Pickering Lineament:
Criterion:                                   Probability:
Association with MN ≥ 5 seismicity           0
Association with 2 ≤ MN < 5 seismicity       0.1

Evidence for reactivation                    0.1

Seismogenic crustal extent                   0.1
Probability of being seismogenic             0.05
Assuming extension into New York State:
Criterion:                                   Probability:
Association with MN ≥ 5 seismicity           0.1
Association with 2 ≤ MN < 5 seismicity       0.1
Evidence for reactivation                    0.1
Slip favourable w/present stress regime      0.1
Seismogenic crustal extent                   0.1
Probability of being seismogenic             0.12
The 1929 mb 5.2 Attica, New York, earthquake is located at the southeast end of the GBLZ,
and most interpretations associate this event with the Clarendon-Linden fault system
(Herrmann 1978, Seeber and Armbruster 1993, Tuttle et al. 2002). However, given the error
(less than 50 km) associated with the epicentral location of the Attica event, it could be
associated with the GBLZ. There is also uncertainty in the epicentral location and magnitude
of the 1857 Lockport event: the most recent interpretation revises its magnitude downward and
places it southwest of Buffalo; its previous location placed it within the GBLZ. When the GBLZ
is assumed to extend into New York State, given the possibility of a spatial association with the
1929 Attica event, we assign a very low probability (0.1) to the GBLZ associated with mb ≥5
seismicity. In light of the recent reinterpretation of the 1857 Lockport event, we do not
consider it to be spatially associated with this zone. When the GBLZ is assumed to be
truncated, there is no association with mb ≥ 5 seismicity.
Wallach and Mohajer (1990) reported that at least eight small-magnitude earthquakes, both
historical and instrumentally recorded events, define a line that extends along the GBLZ from
northwestern New York State to the northeastern corner of Georgian Bay. Several
small-magnitude events are located within the mapped trace of the GBLZ in the Lake Ontario
vicinity, and numerous others occur adjacent and proximal to it in the northeast. The
northwest-trending gravity gradient south of Lake Ontario near the Clarendon-Linden fault
system appears to be spatially associated with some seismicity. However, the small-
magnitude seismicity that is spatially associated with the GBLZ occurs as small, isolated
clusters in parts of the zone, does not define a continuous alignment along it, and consists of
relatively few events such that the number of events within the zone is not greatly different
from that occurring outside of it. Given the rather weak spatial association of some events with
this feature and the absence of a linear alignment along it, a very low probability (0.1) is
assigned to the GBLZ associated with small-magnitude seismicity.
There are no data to directly evaluate the downdip extent of the GBLZ. Furthermore, unlike
the Niagara-Pickering linear zone and the Clarendon-Linden fault system (described below),
no major tectonic boundary has been defined by Rankin et al. (1993) that is spatially coincident
with this feature. The relatively weak, discontinuous geophysical expression of the GBLZ
suggests it is not a prominent crustal structure. The northwest-trending transfer zones among
the north-south-striking Clarendon-Linden faults could be considered analogous to
hypothesised features that compose the GBLZ. However, these northwest-trending structures
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                        - 90 -                                March 2011
occur in the Paleozoic cover, and do not unequivocally extend to seismogenic depths. Given
the weak geophysical expression of this feature relative to the other geophysical lineaments in
the region, and its discontinuous nature, we assign a low probability (0.1) to the GBLZ’s
extending to seismogenic depths.
Wallach (1995) reported that a northwest-trending linear feature, several hundred meters long
was recognised in the glacio-lacustrine sediments of Georgian Bay. This feature occurs
parallel to the GBLZ and was interpreted as resulting from degassing or dewatering, which
suggests the presence of an open fracture or active fault. While the orientation of this feature
is considered favourable for reactivation in the current tectonic stress regime, there is no
evidence that the feature is accompanied by brittle tectonic displacement. Given the
uncertainty in the origin of this feature and the ambiguous association of this feature with the
GBLZ, we assign a very low probability (0.1) to the GBLZ’s having evidence for brittle slip
consistent with the contemporary tectonic stress regime.
Wallach and Mohajer (1990) reported evidence of brittle deformation in both the Precambrian
and Paleozoic rocks within the GBLZ. Two small-displacement northwest-striking normal faults,
whose ages are unknown, occur in lower Paleozoic rocks along the trend of the GBLZ and are
postulated to be associated with it (Wallach and Mohajer 1990). There is no evidence indicating
a structural association of these local outcrop-scale faults with the postulated basement
structures underlying the GBLZ, other than the similarity in their trends. Small-displacement
faults occur in the lower Paleozoic rocks throughout southern Ontario; these structures have not
been studied systematically to determine whether they are anomalous in the vicinity of the
GBLZ.
The northwest-trending fault zones associated with the Clarendon-Linden fault system were
active in the Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian (Jacobi and Fountain 2002), and it is possible
that these faults could be considered analogous to hypothesised structures in the GBLZ.
Eyles et al. (1993) suggested that the position of the Laurentian channel, a northwest-trending
pre-glacial outlet between Georgian Bay and Lake Ontario, is controlled by a basement
structure, i.e., the GBLZ. The foregoing information is considered possible evidence of
reactivation of hypothesised structures that compose the GBLZ. However, given the
geophysical evidence suggesting that the GBLZ is not a Grenville crustal structure
(e.g., Boyce and Morris 2002), we assign a very low probability (0.1) to the GBLZ’s having
multiple episodes of reactivation.
Considering all of the information above, the probability that the truncated GBLZ is
seismogenic is 0.05. If the feature extends into New York State, we arrive at a probability of
0.12 that the GBLZ is seismogenic.
3.3.4      Niagara-Pickering Linear Zone
The Niagara-Pickering linear zone (NPLZ) is a north-northeast-trending feature defined by a
prominent linear aeromagnetic anomaly, a less well-defined Bouguer gravity anomaly, and
linear physiographic features (Wallach and Mohajer 1990). This linear zone is the most
prominent northeast-trending magnetic boundary identified in the region by
Boyce and Morris (2002) in their mapping of aeromagnetic lineaments using image-enhanced
first vertical derivative maps. The NPLZ is reported by some (e.g., Easton and Carter 1995,
Wallach et al. 1998) to coincide with the southward projection of the CMBBZ, which is exposed
in the Grenville province and extends southward from the Canadian Shield. Based on deep
seismic reflection profiling, however, O’Dowd et al. (2004) propose that the buried extension of
the CMBBZ is located along the western shoreline of Lake Ontario, west of the Mississauga
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                        - 91 -                                  March 2011
domain (see Figure 2.15), and therefore is not coincident with the NPLZ. South of Lake
Ontario, the magnetic anomaly associated with the NPLZ is postulated to connect with the
Akron magnetic boundary (Wallach 1990, Mohajer 1993).
The depth to the magnetic sources along strike of the NPLZ gradually increases from 2 km in the
north to 4 km in the south, consistent with the southward thickening of the Paleozoic cover
(Roest 1995). Roest (1995) reports that the magnetic field data indicate that the Niagara-Pickering
magnetic lineament is not an isolated feature. He describes it as a series of more or less
en-echelon, curvilinear anomalies within a zone (i.e., the CMBBZ) that widens to the north and
south of the northern Lake Ontario shoreline. Roest (1995) also reports that it is not the
highest-amplitude anomaly over Lake Ontario, and that the associated gravity signature is
relatively subtle.
Wallach (1995) reports that outcrop-scale faults and fractures within Grenvillian and upper
Middle Ordovician rocks within and adjacent to the NPLZ/CMBBZ provide unequivocal
evidence for three separate phases of brittle reverse, normal, and strike-slip faulting along the
NPLZ/CMBBZ and a zone at least 30 km wide to the east. However, Wallach (1995) does not
report on the amount or timing of faulting or the full extent of the area affected. Wallach (1995)
also reports evidence of macro-scale faulting along the NPLZ/CMBBZ, based on an apparent
right-lateral separation of lower Paleozoic rocks shown on a bedrock geology map of Ontario
(Ontario Geological Survey 1991). Wallach and Mohajer (1990) suggest that the possible
spatial association of historical earthquakes with the NPLZ, including the 1853 modified
Mercalli (MM) intensity V event and possibly the 1873 MM intensity VI event, may indicate that
the NPLZ may be seismically active.
Mereu et al. (2002) report that in the western Lake Ontario area, the earthquake pattern from
the Southern Ontario Seismic Network is significantly different from the past earthquake
patterns obtained when the instrument coverage was poor. Based on analyses by
O’Dowd et al. who also cite the work by Mereu et al. (2002), seismicity trends and implied
basement faults are oblique to and offset from the NPLZ (O’Dowd et al. 2004).
Dineva et al. (2004) relocate hypocenters from earthquakes occurring between 1990 and 2001
that delineate clusters of events beneath Lake Ontario. They report that their clusters A and B
cross the Niagara-Pickering lineament, but the trends of the clusters are rotated by about
30 degrees and thus do not appear to be associated with the NPLZ.
Seismogenic Potential: There are uncertainties associated with whether the NPLZ is
structurally related to the Akron magnetic boundary. Because this possibility affects the
assessment of seismogenic potential, two separate assessments are made for the NPLZ:
(1) no association with the Akron magnetic boundary, and (2) an association with the Akron
magnetic boundary.
It has been postulated that the CMBBZ/NPLZ and the Akron magnetic boundary may
represent the same Grenville terrane boundary, based on similarities in their magnetic
attributes (Rankin et al. 1993) and the observation that the lineaments appear to curve towards
one another (Wallach 1995). Wallach (1995) notes that the apparent curvature evident in the
magnetic field map also is evident on the gravity map of the region. Rankin et al. (1993) have
interpreted the Akron magnetic boundary as a major Grenville terrane boundary, and they
have mapped the northern extension of the Akron magnetic boundary north of Lake Erie as a
continuous feature that appears to coincide with the CMBBZ (Figure 2.14).
Carter and Easton (1990) and Easton (1992), however, have not interpreted the magnetic
features as representing the same structural boundary. Carter and Easton (1990) used both
magnetic and limited borehole data in southern Ontario to extend the CMBBZ beneath the
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                        - 92 -                                March 2011
Paleozoic cover as far south as northeastern Pennsylvania (Figure 2.8 and Figure 2.12).
Forsyth et al. (1994a) also used structural constraints, along with magnetic data, to interpret
the southerly continuation of the CMBBZ beneath western Lake Ontario and eastern Lake Erie
and into northeastern Pennsylvania (Figure 2.13), approximately coincident with the
interpretation of Carter and Easton (1990).
O’Dowd et al. (2004) state that the Niagara-Pickering lineament ends abruptly south of Lake
Ontario and interpret the CMBBZ to be located along a magnetic high near the western end of
Lake Erie (see the discussion below of the Mississauga magnetic domain source zone). The
Akron magnetic boundary is distinct from the NPLZ on the map of interpreted aeromagnetic
and gravity lineaments developed by Boyce and Morris (2002).
Based on the available data, we consider the likelihood of the model that considers the
CMBBZ and the Akron magnetic boundary to not be the same tectonic feature to be twice that
of the model that says they are the same tectonic feature. In the case where the two features
are assumed to be connected (i.e., the same tectonic feature), the geometry of the Akron
magnetic boundary is assumed to be consistent with the geometry of the NPLZ/CMBBZ as
imaged in the deep seismic data (e.g., White et al. 1994).
The following lists summarise the assessments of the seismogenic potential of the NPLZ. The
individual assessments are characterised below.
Assuming no association with the Akron Lineament:
Criterion:                                  Probability:
Association with MN  5 seismicity          0
Association with 2  MN < 5 seismicity      0.1
Evidence for reactivation                   0.5
Slip favourable w/present stress regime     0.2
Seismogenic crustal extent                  1.0
Probability of being seismogenic            0.08
Assuming an association with the Akron magnetic Lineament:
Criterion:                                  Probability:
Association with MN  5 seismicity          0.2
Association with 2  MN < 5 seismicity      0.25
Evidence for reactivation                   0.5
Slip favourable w/present stress regime     0.2
Seismogenic crustal extent                  1.0
Probability of being seismogenic            0.30
The 1929 mb 5.2 Attica, New York, event and the 1986 mbLg 5 Leroy, Ohio, event are the only
known mb 5 earthquakes in the region that could have occurred on the NPLZ. The epicentral
location of the Attica event is well constrained and lies 80 km to the southeast of the NPLZ.
Given the error in the epicentral location of the Attica event (less than 50 km), it cannot be
associated with the NPLZ. The Leroy event is located well over 100 km from the NPLZ. When
the NPLZ and the Akron magnetic boundary are not connected, a probability of zero is
assigned to the NPLZ associated with M > 5 seismicity. The epicentral location of the mbLg 5
Leroy event is well constrained and appears to be spatially associated with the Akron magnetic
boundary (Seeber and Armbruster 1993, 1995). Two additional mb > 5 events (one historical,
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                        - 93 -                                March 2011
the other recorded) occur proximal to the Akron magnetic boundary in southern Ohio
(Plate 11). Therefore, when a connection between the NPLZ and the Akron magnetic
boundary is assumed, a low probability (0.2) is assigned to the NPLZ’s being associated with
mb > 5 seismicity.
A cluster of historical and instrumentally recorded small-magnitude seismicity occurs in the
Niagara Falls area, between Lakes Ontario and Erie. Very few of the events within this cluster
are spatially coincident with the NPLZ. Along the northern portion of the NPLZ, seismicity is
much more diffuse, and even fewer instrumentally recorded small-magnitude events occur in
the vicinity of the mapped trace of the NPLZ/CMBBZ. Deep seismic data
(e.g., Forsyth et al. 1994a) indicate that the CMBBZ is a gently east-dipping structure.
Considering this geometry and the depth distribution of earthquakes in the western Lake
Ontario region, events located near the surface trace that occur deeper than about 5 km are
likely not associated with this feature. East of the mapped trace (i.e., downdip), seismicity is
diffuse and cannot be distinguished from random background activity. For the case when
there is no connection between the NPLZ and the Akron magnetic boundary, we assign a very
low probability (0.1) to the NPLZ associated with small-magnitude seismicity. This assessment
reflects the observation that very few events are spatially associated with the NPLZ, and there
is no associated linear alignment of small-magnitude seismicity along it.
A relatively dense cluster of small-magnitude seismicity occurs in the vicinity of the Akron
magnetic boundary. A number of these events, both historical and recorded, are aligned along
the trend of the feature. Since the associated seismicity forms an alignment along only a small
portion of the entire feature, however, we assign a low probability (0.25) to the NPLZ’s being
associated with small-magnitude seismicity.
Deep seismic reflection profiles collected across the CMBBZ in Lakes Erie and Ontario show
that this gently east-dipping feature extends to the lower crust. Further, the CMBBZ is a
profound feature in the magnetic data, suggesting a deep crustal structure. Therefore, a very
high probability (1.0) is assigned to the NPLZ/CMBBZ’s extending to seismogenic depths.
Evidence for brittle slip on the NPLZ in the contemporary tectonic stress regime consists of the
mesoscale brittle reverse and strike-slip faults along the CMBBZ/NPLZ reported by
Wallach (1995), and an apparent right-lateral separation of the upper Middle Ordovician rocks
at Lake Scugog shown on the bedrock geology map of southern Ontario
(Ontario Geological Survey 1991). The apparent right-lateral separation at Lake Scugog is not
compelling evidence of brittle faulting. Much of the regional bedrock distribution was
determined from water well records, and data coverage in this area is very limited
(Eyles et al. 1993). Further, there is no corresponding right-lateral offset in the Middle
Ordovician outcrop belt to the north (Ontario Geological Survey 1991). Hence the mapped
bedrock distribution, if true, could be explained simply by glacial erosion.
Sanford (1993) examined the Middle Ordovician rocks along the Precambrian/Paleozoic
contact at the western boundary of the CMBBZ and found no evidence of brittle faulting at this
location. Sanford (1993) did document normal faulting at several locations to the east of this
area. The faults were predominantly northwest-striking and generally exhibited vertical offsets
of less than one meter. Sanford (1993) noted minor northwest-striking strike-slip faults at one
location and a normal fault with a vertical displacement of several tens of meters at another
location. Sanford (1995) and McQuest Marine (1995) also interpreted possible faults beneath
Lake Ontario in the vicinity of the intersection between the NPLZ and the Hamilton-Presqu’ile
lineament. However, these interpreted faults are oriented approximately parallel to the
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                        - 94 -                                 March 2011
Hamilton-Presqu’ile lineament, and therefore, we consider an association of these features
with the NPLZ to be unlikely.
Lewis et al. (1995) documented numerous small-displacement (0.5 m) normal faults in this
area; however, these structures were limited to a package of stratified sediment and did not
penetrate bedrock. Lewis et al. (1995) suggest the structures may have formed due to
differential settling of the underlying sediments. Lewis et al. also documented numerous
sediment depressions in the vicinity of the NPLZ, the margins of which resemble monoclines.
These features were attributed to sediment drape into a depression, rather than displacement
of sediment after deposition, based on continuous and undisturbed reflection data. The
depressions could not be correlated to deeper sedimentological or bedrock features, which
strongly suggests a nontectonic origin (Lewis et al. 1995). Lewis et al. (1995) note that these
features are widely distributed in the basin and are spatially unrelated to the various underlying
geophysical lineaments. Based on the available evidence, which includes the local reverse
and strike-slip faults in the Middle Ordovician rocks reported by Wallach (1995) and the minor
strike-slip faults in the vicinity of the NPLZ documented by Sanford (1993), we assign a low
probability (0.2) to the NPLZ’s having evidence of brittle slip in the present tectonic stress
regime.
Wallach (1990, 1995) reports observations of outcrop scale structures in both Precambrian
and Paleozoic rocks and suggests that the NPLZ/CMBBZ has undergone several episodes of
brittle reactivation. Deep seismic reflection data collected in eastern Lake Erie indicate that the
CMBBZ was reactivated once in extension (Milkereit et al. 1992). Eyles et al. (1993) present
evidence suggesting a possible relationship between the CMBBZ and a relict drainage system
cut across the lower Paleozoic cover in the western Lake Ontario region. Eyles et al. (1993)
suggest that the position of a northeast-trending channel on the Niagara Peninsula, along with
another northeast-trending channel north of Lake Ontario, indicates the upwards propagation
of fractures associated with reactivation of the CMBBZ. Wallach and Mohajer (1990) also note
that northeast-trending linear lakes and swamps parallel the CMBBZ/NPLZ.
Sanford (1993) and Rutty and Cruden (1993) documented surface lineaments trending
north-northeast as well as northeast and northwest along the CMBBZ/NPLZ in both the lower
Paleozoic rocks and the exposed Grenville rocks. The origin of the north-northeast-trending
surface lineaments is questionable, and it is not known whether they are geographically limited
to the CMBBZ/NPLZ (Sanford 1993, Rutty and Cruden 1993). North-northeast-trending joints
and fractures have been documented in numerous other areas around Lake Ontario
(e.g., McFall 1993, Mohajer et al. 1992). Rutty and Cruden (1993) also report that
northwest-trending pop-ups are the only neotectonic structures present within the Paleozoic
rocks immediately south of the exposed CMBBZ, and their orientations suggest they are
genetically unrelated to recent reactivation of the CMBBZ.
From the deep seismic data it is clear that the CMBBZ has undergone at least one episode of
reactivation. The spatial association of the relict Paleozoic drainages and the CMBBZ also
suggests possible reactivation, though it is not as compelling as the seismic data. It is not
clear whether the local brittle faulting in the Grenvillian and lower Paleozoic rocks reported by
Wallach (1995) and Sanford (1993) is associated with reactivation of the CMBBZ or other
processes, such as isostatic depression and rebound. Sanford (1993) suggests that periodic
uplift of the regional basement-cored arches during the various Phanerozoic compressional
and extensional tectonic regimes could be responsible for the small-scale deformation
observed in the lower Paleozoic rocks throughout the southern Ontario region. Small-scale
faulting occurs throughout the Ordovician outcrop belt north of Lake Ontario, and these fault
structures have not been systematically analyzed to determine whether they are anomalous in
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                       - 95 -                               March 2011
the vicinity of the NPLZ. Considering the foregoing information, we assign a moderate
probability (0.5) to the NPLZ/CMBBZ’s having evidence of multiple episodes of reactivation.
We arrive at a probability of 0.08 that the NPLZ is seismogenic. If a connection between the
NPLZ and the Akron magnetic boundary is assumed, we arrive at a probability of 0.30 that the
NPLZ is seismogenic; this assessment is updated to a probability of 0.35, however, based on
the following additional information.
Additional Information: Additional information exists that is pertinent to the assessment of
the seismogenic potential of the NPLZ. Aftershock hypocenters of the 1986 mbLg 5 Leroy,
Ohio, event suggest a northeast-striking vertical rupture about 1 km across, and place the
event at a depth of about 6 km within the Grenville basement (Seeber and Armbruster 1993,
1995). This orientation is parallel to the trend of the Akron magnetic boundary and lends
support to the possibility that the earthquake was associated with the feature. Fault plane
solutions suggest a right-lateral motion, which is consistent with the northeast-southwest
orientation of horizontal compression in the regional stress field (Seeber and Armbruster 1993,
1995).
If the NPLZ/CMBBZ and the Akron magnetic boundary are assumed to be a single source, the
geometry of the feature is assumed to be consistent with the geometry of the CMBBZ as
determined from deep seismic data (e.g., White et al. 1994, Forsyth et al. 1994a). These data
indicate that the north-northeast-trending CMBBZ comprises gently east-dipping structures
(White et al. 1994). Focal mechanisms for the Leroy event yield a northeast-striking vertical
plane, which is not consistent with the geometry of the CMBBZ. In our judgment, the relative
likelihood of observing an inconsistent focal mechanism for a given seismogenic feature
compared to a given nonseismogenic feature is estimated to be 1.25:1.
Given the additional information and using Equation (3.2), the probability that the NPLZ is
seismogenic is updated from 0.30 to 0.35 when an association with the Akron magnetic
boundary is assumed.
3.3.5     Wilson–Port Hope Magnetic Lineament
The northeast-trending Wilson–Port Hope magnetic lineament extends for approximately
80 km across central Lake Ontario, from Port Hope, Ontario, in the north, to Wilson, New York,
in the south (Mohajer 1993, McQuest Marine 1995, see Figure 2.22). It lies between and
subparallel to the NPLZ and the Clarendon-Linden fault system, along the trend of a system of
prominent subsurface fractures in the Lake Erie–Niagara Falls area identified by
Sanford et al. (1985) and McQuest Marine (1995). Mohajer (1993) shows the Wilson-Port
Hope lineament as comprising three discontinuous, slightly curvilinear segments. McQuest
Marine (1995) suggests this feature may correspond to a Precambrian basement structure.
Although recent seismic reflection data do not reveal any faults along this lineament, McQuest
Marine (1995) concluded that evidence from other studies (e.g., Sanford et al. 1985) suggests
that the Wilson–Port Hope lineament may be a currently active fault. Dineva et al. (2004)
relocate hypocenters from earthquakes occurring between 1990 and 2001 that delineate
clusters of events beneath Lake Ontario. The closest cluster of earthquakes they recognise
near the Wilson-Port Hope magnetic lineament is their cluster C, which is parallel to the
Clarendon-Linden fault system but is shifted slightly to the southeast by about 4 km.
Seismogenic Potential: The following list summarises the assessment of the seismogenic
potential of the Wilson–Port Hope lineament. The individual assessments are described
below.
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                        - 96 -                                March 2011
Criterion:                                  Probability:
Association with MN > 5 seismicity          0
Association with 2 < MN < 5 seismicity      0.1
Evidence for reactivation                   0.4
Slip favourable w/present stress regime     0.1
Seismogenic crustal extent                  0.2
Probability of being seismogenic            0.06
Both of the known mb ≥ 5 earthquakes in the region (1929 mb 5.2 Attica, New York, and 1986
mbLg 5 Leroy, Ohio) are located more than 50 km away from the Wilson–Port Hope lineament.
Similarly, the relocated epicenter of the 1857 event lies approximately 75 km southwest of the
lineament. Considering that the errors in the epicentral locations of these events are less than
50 km, a probability of zero is assigned to the Wilson–Port Hope lineament associated with MN
≥5 seismicity.
There is no obvious spatial association of the Wilson–Port Hope lineament with small-magnitude
seismicity. A few events have occurred near the northern end of the lineament, however, and
could be projected onto it. Several events also have occurred near the intersection of this
lineament with the GBLZ, and these events could be associated with either feature. Based on
the scarcity of events that have occurred near the Wilson–Port Hope lineament and the lack of
an alignment of events along this feature, we assign a very low probability (0.1) to the
Wilson-Port Hope lineament’s being associated with small-magnitude seismicity.
It is not known whether this magnetic feature corresponds to an actual structure in the
Grenville basement or whether it simply reflects variable basement lithology. It does not
appear to be defined by truncated, offset potential field anomalies; rather, it appears to be
defined by a narrow, linear, positive anomaly. Although its trend is subparallel to other known
Grenville structures in the region, a structure corresponding to this anomaly is not readily
apparent in the data of Forsyth et al. (1994a). Therefore, a low probability (0.2) is assigned to
the Wilson–Port Hope lineament’s extending to seismogenic depths.
Seismic reflection data collected across the Wilson–Port Hope lineament in southern Lake
Ontario do not reveal the presence of any faults in the lake bottom (McQuest Marine 1995).
Side-scan sonar lines collected across this lineament reveal dark linear features, some of
which are interpreted as anchor scours, and segmented dark marks that are interpreted to be
possible degassing marks along fractures (McQuest Marine 1995). The distribution of these
features does not suggest a spatial association with the lineament. McQuest Marine (1995)
also reports that a system of open fractures at least 40 km long occurs roughly perpendicular
to the southern end of the Wilson–Port Hope lineament, based on sediment-water-chemical
relationships. However, the relationship between the inferred open fracture system and the
Wilson–Port Hope lineament is ambiguous, and no explanation is offered by McQuest
Marine (1995). Given the lack of clear evidence for brittle faulting on the Wilson–Port Hope
lineament, but considering the possibility that the lake-bottom features identified by McQuest
Marine (1995) represent slip at depth and are associated with the Wilson–Port Hope
lineament, we assign a very low probability (0.1) to the Wilson–Port Hope lineament’s having
evidence for brittle slip consistent with the present-day regional stress regime.
There is no evidence that the Wilson–Port Hope lineament has undergone multiple episodes of
reactivation. Therefore, we assign a moderate probability of 0.4 to reflect the judgment that
fewer structures display evidence of multiple reactivations than those that display evidence of
no reactivation.

Based on the above assessments, the probability that the Wilson–Port Hope lineament is
seismogenic is 0.06.
3.3.6     Hamilton-Presqu’ile Lineament
The Hamilton-Presqu’ile lineament strikes east-northeast and extends for approximately
200 km, from near the western shore of Lake Ontario to Prince Edward County in the northeast
(Ontario Geological Survey 1991; see Figure 2.21). This feature was recognised by
McFall and Allam (1991) as a discontinuous aeromagnetic lineament in the Precambrian
basement beneath Lake Ontario, and was later classified as a subsurface fault by the Ontario
Geological Survey (1991). McQuest Marine (1995) reported that four faults, displacing
lake-bottom sediments estimated to be about 11,000 years old and bedrock, can be seen in
airgun seismic reflection profiles collected across this feature in the vicinity of the intersection
of the Hamilton-Presqu’ile lineament with the NPLZ. The interpreted faults are
northeast-striking and predominantly north-dipping and have apparent throws of up to 7 m.
Sanford (1995) also interpreted numerous small-displacement northeast-trending fractures
affecting the Paleozoic bedrock and post-Paleozoic sediments in this area from sleeve airgun
profiles. Lewis et al. (1995) interpreted several small-displacement (0.5 m) normal faults in the
same general area of western Lake Ontario. The interpreted faults occur in acoustically
stratified sediment also estimated to be about 11 ka, and Lewis et al. (1995) suggest that
differential settling of the underlying sediment could be responsible for the features.
Lewis et al. (1995) also documented numerous sediment depressions in this area, and the
margins of some of these depressions resemble monoclines. These features were attributed
to sediment drape into a depression rather than displacement of sediment after deposition,
based on continuous and undisturbed reflection data (Lewis et al. 1995). The depressions
could not be correlated to deeper sedimentological or bedrock features, which strongly
suggests a nontectonic origin (Lewis et al. 1995).
Thomas et al. (1993) noted that the Hamilton-Presqu’ile lineament lies parallel to and just north
of the northern margin of the postulated southwest extension of the SLRS as illustrated by
Adams and Basham (1989). Thomas et al. (1993) thus interpreted this structure to represent
either the northern boundary of the St. Lawrence rift extension or one of a series of faults
within a rift zone wider than previously envisaged. It should be noted that, at the intersection
of the Hamilton-Presqu’ile lineament with the Niagara-Pickering linear zone, the
east-west-trending magnetic lineament associated with the Hamilton-Presqu’ile lineament
appears to be truncated by the north-northeast-trending Niagara-Pickering magnetic
lineament.
Dineva et al. (2004) relocated hypocenters from earthquakes occurring between 1990 and
2001 that delineate clusters of events beneath Lake Ontario. Their clusters A, B, and C are
situated close to the Hamilton-Presqu’ile lineament, but neither the orientation of clusters nor
the hypothetical line connecting clusters A and B are parallel to this lineament
(Dineva et al. 2004).
Seismogenic Potential: The following list summarises the assessment of the seismogenic
potential of the Hamilton-Presqu’ile lineament.
Criterion:                                   Probability:
Association with MN ≥ 5 seismicity           0
Association with 2 ≤ MN < 5 seismicity       0.15
Evidence for reactivation                    0.2
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                        - 98 -                                 March 2011
Slip favourable w/present stress regime 0.1
Seismogenic crustal extent                   0.5
Probability of being seismogenic             0.08
Both of the known MN ≥ 5 earthquakes in the region occur well over 50 km away from the
Hamilton-Presqu’ile lineament. Given that the error in the epicentral locations of these events
is less than 50 km, we assign a probability of zero to the Hamilton-Presqu’ile lineament
associated with MN ≥ 5 seismicity.
Mohajer (1993) reported that at least 10 small-magnitude earthquakes (historical and
instrumentally recorded events) are possibly associated with the Hamilton-Presqu’ile
lineament. Seven of these earthquakes occur at or near the intersection of the Mississauga
magnetic domain seismic zone (described below) and the Hamilton-Presqu’ile lineament, and
three of the events can be associated with either feature (Mohajer 1993). Seismicity that could
be spatially associated with the Hamilton-Presqu’ile lineament is relatively scattered and does
not form an alignment along the feature. A weak cluster occurs near the eastern end of the
Hamilton-Presqu’ile lineament, which is proximal to the Wilson–Port Hope lineament and could
be associated with either structure. Given the scarcity of events proximal to this feature and
the absence of an alignment of seismicity along it, we assign a low probability (0.15) to the
Hamilton-Presqu’ile lineament’s being associated with small-magnitude seismicity.
There are no data to directly evaluate the downdip geometry and extent of the
Hamilton-Presqu’ile lineament. However, based on its mapped length (200 km) and the 40 m
of displaced Paleozoic rocks across this feature, a moderate probability (0.5) is assigned to the
feature’s extending to seismogenic depths.
Evidence for brittle slip in the present stress regime consists of the displaced Paleozoic rocks
across the eastern end of the lineament and the interpreted faults on the lake bottom
(e.g., McQuest Marine 1995, Sanford 1995). The faults interpreted from seismic reflection
data of McQuest Marine (1995) exhibit a downwards decrease in displacement, which
suggests they are not tectonic structures. Further, the vertical exaggeration of the cross
section is over 60 times, which grossly distorts the actual relief of the reflectors. Sanford
(1995) interpreted numerous apparent block faults affecting bedrock and overlying
post-Paleozoic sediments along the trend of the Hamilton-Presqu’ile lineament in western Lake
Ontario. However, the timing and sense of movement on these structures could not be
precisely established (Sanford 1995). Although the northeast orientation of the faults
interpreted by McQuest Marine (1995) is considered favourable for reactivation in the present
tectonic stress field, their normal sense of displacement is not consistent with
northeast-southwest-oriented compression. Furthermore, their apparent downdip decrease in
offset strongly suggests a nontectonic origin. The normal sense of displacement of the
Paleozoic rocks across the east end of the lineament also is considered inconsistent with
regional northeast-oriented compression. The origin, age, and sense of displacement of the
features interpreted by Sanford (1995) are questionable; however, their orientations suggest a
possible association with the Hamilton-Presqu’ile lineament. Based on the available evidence,
we assign a very low probability (0.1) to the Hamilton-Presqu’ile lineament’s having evidence
of brittle faulting compatible with the present-day regional tectonic stress regime.
McFall and Allam (1991) originally defined this structure on the basis of aeromagnetic data,
which implies that it lies within the Grenville basement because the overlying Paleozoic cover
has relatively no magnetic signal (McFall 1993). Ordovician rocks displaced 40 m down to the
north across the eastern end of the Hamilton-Presqu’ile lineament are considered potential
evidence for an episode of reactivation of this structure. Additional evidence of brittle
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                        - 99 -                               March 2011
reactivation of the Hamilton-Presqu’ile lineament consists of the interpreted lake-bottom faults
along the trend of the lineament in western Lake Ontario. Sanford (1995) interpreted block
faulting of the Ordovician rocks in this area and suggested that some of these faults may have
moved in post-Paleozoic time. It is unknown, however, whether these structures are
associated with the Hamilton-Presqu’ile lineament. None of the faults interpreted by Sanford
(1995) can be shown unequivocally to displace the recent lake-bottom sediments. Based on
this information, a low probability (0.2) is assigned to the Hamilton-Presqu’ile lineament’s
having evidence of multiple episodes of reactivation.
Based on the above assessment, we arrive at a probability of 0.08 that the Hamilton-Presqu’ile
lineament is seismogenic.
3.3.7     Clarendon-Linden Fault System
The Clarendon-Linden fault system is a broad zone of small faults with small displacements in
the lower Paleozoic bedrock. The fault system is at least 77 km long and 7 – 17 km wide; it is
spatially coincident with a north-trending geophysical (combined aeromagnetic and gravity)
lineament within the basement rock (Fakundiny and Pomeroy 2002). The fault system may
extend for approximately 150 km from just north of the Pennsylvania border
(Jacobi and Fountain 1993) to the north shore of Lake Ontario (Hutchinson et al. 1979; see
Figure 2.22). Closely spaced, small-offset step faults characterise the Clarendon-Linden fault
system in outcrops of Devonian rocks (Jacobi and Fountain 1993, 2002). By integrating
surface stratigraphy, structure, soil gas and lineaments, Jacobi and Fountain (2002) could
recognise the location of as many as 10 parallel, segmented faults across the fault system in
southwestern New York state. The main strand of the Clarendon-Linden fault system is highly
segmented, steeply east-dipping in the north and west-dipping in the south, and displays a
maximum vertical displacement of about 80 m (Jacobi and Fountain 1993). Cumulative offset
across the Clarendon-Linden fault system is as high as ~170 m, based on well log, outcrop,
and seismic data (Jacobi and Fountain 2002). Forsyth et al. (1994b) have suggested that the
Clarendon-Linden fault system is part of a wider zone of small Paleozoic faults that lie above
the crestal area of a northeast-trending Precambrian bedrock high, termed the Iroquoian high.
Crone and Wheeler (2000) identify the Clarendon-Linden fault zone in New York as a Class C
tectonic feature.
Deep seismic reflection data suggest that the Clarendon-Linden fault system is coincident with
structures associated with the Elzevir-Frontenac terrane boundary zone of the Grenville
province (Forsyth et al. 1994b). Seismic reflection profiles clearly show the gently east-dipping
ductile thrusts of the Elzevir-Frontenac boundary zone extending up to the
Precambrian/Paleozoic contact in the region of the Clarendon-Linden fault system
(Forsyth et al. 1994, Jacobi and Fountain 2002). The Salmon River fault, which is exposed
approximately 30 km north of Lake Ontario, is believed to be the northern extension of the
Clarendon-Linden fault system (McFall 1993).
Farther north, the projection of the Clarendon-Linden fault system and Salmon River faults
coincide with the Robertson Lake mylonite zone in the Canadian Shield (McFall 1993). The
surface continuity of inferred faults constituting the Clarendon-Linden fault system is not
strongly supported by the reprocessed seismic data examined by
Ouassaa and Forsyth (2002). From this same study it was noted that north- to
northeast-trending curvilinear magnetic and gravity anomalies parallel, but are not restricted to,
the principal trend of the postulated Clarendon-Linden fault system
(Ouassaa and Forsyth 2002).
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                        - 100 -                               March 2011
Dineva et al. (2004) relocate hypocenters from earthquakes occurring between 1990 and 2001
that delineate clusters of events beneath Lake Ontario. They report that their cluster C is
parallel to the Clarendon-Linden fault system but shifted slightly to the southeast by about
4 km. During the 1990–2001 recording period for their analysis, Dineva et al. (2004) note that
little seismic activity occurred along the Clarendon-Linden fault system, with only two events
near the southern end.
A paleoliquefaction study of the Clarendon-Linden fault system was conducted by
Tuttle et al. (2002); their investigations indicated a lack of earthquake-induced liquefaction
features in geologic units that suggest the fault system did not generate large M >6
earthquakes during the past 12,000 years. Tuttle et al. (2002) conclude that the fault system
could have produced small and moderate earthquakes, but probably not large events during
the Late Wisconsinan and Holocene.
The Clarendon-Linden fault system probably represents brittle reactivation of a major Grenville
structure (Hutchinson et al. 1979, Seeber and Armbruster 1995). The detailed map pattern of
the Clarendon-Linden fault system shows that the north-south-trending faults comprise
numerous short segments connected by oblique northwest-trending transfer faults, similar to
those in rift settings (Jacobi and Fountain 2002). Culotta et al. (1990) have correlated the
Clarendon-Linden fault system with a continental-scale magnetic lineament, the Amish
anomaly, which extends from New York to Alabama (Culotta et al. 1990). This feature is
interpreted as a major Grenville terrane boundary that separates the Elzevir and Frontenac
tectonic blocks (Culotta et al. 1990). Wheeler (1995) placed the northwestern boundary of the
Iapetan rifted margin along the Clarendon-Linden fault system, which implies it is a potentially
seismogenic structure. The probability of this lineament’s being seismogenic is 0.25.
Seismogenic Potential: The following list summarises the assessment of the seismogenic
potential of the Clarendon-Linden fault system. The individual assessments are described
below.
Criterion:                                    Probability:
Association with MN ≥ 5 seismicity            0.1
Association with 2 ≤ MN < 5 seismicity        0.25
Evidence for reactivation                     1.0
Slip favourable w/present stress regime       0.1
Seismogenic crustal extent                    0.6
Probability of being seismogenic              0.25
The Clarendon-Linden fault system is associated with a well-defined cluster of seismicity,
which is referred to as the Attica seismic zone (Seeber and Armbruster 1995). This zone
contains the 1929 mb 5.2 Attica earthquake, numerous natural small-magnitude events, and
several induced events associated with salt brine recovery at Dale, New York
(Fletcher and Sykes 1977). Seeber and Armbruster (1995) suggest it also is possible that the
1929 event may have been artificially triggered, as the brine fields in Dale were already active
in 1929. Seismicity appears to be spatially associated and possibly aligned with the gravity
gradient that marks the approximate location of the Clarendon-Linden fault system. However,
while seismicity does appear to be spatially associated with a segment of the Clarendon-
Linden fault system, it does not form an alignment along a significant portion of the structure.
Given the observation that the 1929 Attica earthquake occurred within 50 km of the
Clarendon-Linden fault system and is the only known mb ≥ 5 event in the area, a low
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                        - 101 -                                March 2011
probability (0.1) is assigned to the Clarendon-Linden fault system associated with mb ≥5
seismicity.
Based on the cluster of small-magnitude seismicity that is spatially associated and partially
aligned with a short segment of the Clarendon-Linden fault system, but that does not form a
continuous alignment along the length of the feature, a relatively low probability (0.25) is
assigned to the Clarendon-Linden fault system’s being associated with small-magnitude
seismicity.
Deep seismic reflection profiles and geophysical data suggest that the Clarendon-Linden fault
system is associated with basement structures that extend to seismogenic depths
(Forsyth et al. 1994b; Culotta et al. 1990). Although these basement structures cannot be
directly linked to individual Clarendon-Linden faults, the available evidence suggests that a
structural linkage between the features is likely. We therefore assign a moderate probability
(0.6) to the Clarendon-Linden fault system’s extending to seismogenic depths.
There is no clear evidence of brittle slip on the Clarendon-Linden fault system during the
present tectonic stress regime. Jacobi and Fountain (1993) report that gas seeps along the
southern part of Clarendon-Linden fault system were initiated during or shortly after the 1988
Saguenay (mbLg 6.5) earthquake. The source of the gas seeps was inferred to be Devonian
shales at a depth of about 300 m (Jacobi and Fountain 1993). Jacobi and Fountain (1993)
suggest that fractures within the fault zone were opened as a local response to the Saguenay
event. While the opening of fractures and the emission of deep gases from the
Clarendon-Linden fault system suggests recent activity, there is no evidence to suggest that
this activity was accompanied by brittle tectonic displacement at depth. There is no evidence
of recent tectonic deformation at the ground surface. Based on the foregoing information, a
very low probability (0.1) is assigned to the Clarendon-Linden fault system’s having evidence
of brittle slip in the present-day regional tectonic stress regime.
Well data indicate that the Clarendon-Linden fault system was reactivated twice during the
Paleozoic, once in extension and once in compression (Van Tyne 1975). From Early to Middle
Ordovician time, the Clarendon-Linden fault system was periodically active as a normal fault
while its post-Devonian sense of displacement was reverse (Van Tyne 1975, Jacobi and
Fountain 1993). Jacobi and Fountain (2002) have also presented seismic reflection data that
indicate multiple periods of Paleozoic reactivation of the Clarendon-Linden fault system.
Based on this information, a very high probability (1.0) is assigned to the Clarendon-Linden
fault system’s having multiple episodes of reactivation.
Based on our assessment, we arrive at the probability of 0.25 that the Clarendon-Linden fault
system is seismogenic. Given the additional information described below, however, the
probability is updated to 0.40.
Additional Information: Additional information exists regarding the seismogenic potential of
the Clarendon-Linden fault zone. Herrmann (1978) reported that focal mechanism studies of
two shallow (2 – 3 km) earthquakes in 1966 and 1967 in the Attica area suggested that
seismicity occurs along approximately north-northeast-trending Clarendon-Linden faults. The
1966 event (mb = 4.6) yielded solutions with one nodal plane striking north-northeast and
dipping steeply to the east, and a second striking west-northwest and dipping steeply to the
south. If the north-northeast solution is accepted, then the fault motion was primarily
right-lateral strike-slip with a reverse component. The 1967 event (mb = 4.4) yielded solutions
with one nodal plane striking north-northeast and dipping steeply to the east, and a second
west-northwest-striking plane dipping moderately to the south. Again, accepting the
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                      - 102 -                                 March 2011
north-northeast solution indicates right-lateral and reverse slip on the fault. Herrmann (1978)
selected the north-northeast nodal plane as the most likely fault plane solution, in light of the
well log data (Van Tyne 1975) indicating north-northeast-trending Clarendon-Linden faults. He
noted, however, that the west-northwest trend could not be totally discounted.
The focal mechanisms derived from these two events yield solutions that are consistent with
the geometry (both strike and dip) of the Clarendon-Linden faults as determined from both
geologic and seismic data. We judge that it is twice as likely that a consistent focal
mechanism will be observed for a given seismogenic feature than for a given nonseismogenic
feature (relative likelihood 2:1).
Considering this additional information and using Equation (3.2), the probability that the
Clarendon-Linden fault system is seismogenic is updated from 0.25 to 0.40.
3.3.8     Mississauga Magnetic Domain Seismic Zone
This local source zone is named after the Mississauga domain identified by
O’Dowd et al. (2004) on the basis of magnetic anomalies expressed in the subsurface of
western Lake Ontario (see Figure 2.15). The source corresponds with the southern part of a
major lithotectonic domain defined within the Precambrian basement rocks by
Easton and Carter (1995) and named the Fishog domain (see Figure 2.12).
The Mississauga magnetic domain source is approximately coincident with magnetic
lineaments described by Thomas et al. (1993) and Mohajer (1993). Thomas et al. (1993)
identified a magnetic lineament extending for at least 65 km from Burlington to Toronto,
offshore of and parallel to the northeast-trending coastline of western Lake Ontario (see Figure
2.22). This lineament, known as the Burlington-Toronto magnetic lineament
(Thomas et al. 1993), and a parallel magnetic lineament to the west together form a 20 km
wide zone termed by Mohajer (1993) as the Toronto-Hamilton seismic zone. Mohajer (1993)
reported that more than 80 percent of the best-located earthquakes in the western Lake
Ontario region are confined to the Toronto-Hamilton seismic zone. Thomas et al. (1993)
interpreted anomalous lake-bottom features (i.e., dark linear patterns and plumose structures)
and bedrock pop-ups observed in the vicinity of the Burlington-Toronto magnetic lineament as
evidence of neotectonic activity.
Mereu et al. (2002) report that in the western Lake Ontario area, the earthquake pattern from
the Southern Ontario Seismic Network is significantly different from the past earthquake
patterns obtained when the instrument coverage was poor. The new, post-1991 pattern
indicates that most of the events are confined to the lake or just to the southeast of the lake.
The investigators believe that water may be playing a major role in the cause of seismicity in
the region, perhaps related to water flows along fissures below the lake.
Dineva et al. (2004) relocate hypocenters from earthquakes occurring between 1990 and 2001
that delineate clusters of events beneath Lake Ontario. The correlation of these events to
linear trends in magnetic data or linear physiographic features indicates that these events are
offset to the southeast by about 7 – 8 km (cluster A) or 30 km (cluster B) from the
Toronto-Hamilton seismic zone of Mohajer (1993).
Seismogenic Potential: The following list summarises the assessment of whether the
Mississauga magnetic domain seismic zone is seismogenic. The individual assessments are
described below.
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                      - 103 -                                March 2011
Criterion:                                     Probability:
Association with MN 5 seismicity              0
Association with 2  MN < 5 seismicity         0.3
Seismogenic crustal extent                     0.9
Slip favourable w/present stress regime        0.1
Evidence for reactivation                      0.4
Probability of being seismogenic               0.16
The only known historical MN > 5 earthquakes in the region are the 1929 mb 5.2 Attica, New
York, event and the 1986 mbLg 5 Leroy, Ohio, event. The 1857 M ~ 5 Lockport, New York,
event also occurs in the region; however, there is uncertainty as to both its epicentral location
and magnitude. Seeber and Armbruster (1993) recently relocated the 1857 event southwest of
Buffalo, along the south shore of Lake Erie. Previous interpretations placed this event near
Lockport, in upper New York state. In addition to its relocated epicenter,
Seeber and Armbruster (1993) revised the magnitude of the Lockport event to M 4.
The locations of both the Leroy and Attica earthquakes are well constrained, and the error in
their epicentral locations is less than 50 km (Seeber and Armbruster 1993). Both events occur
well over 50 km away from the Mississauga magnetic domain seismic zone, and therefore a
probability of zero is assigned to the Mississauga magnetic domain seismic zone associated
with MN >5 seismicity.
There is a concentration of small-magnitude seismicity in the western Lake Ontario region
relative to the surrounding areas. The depth distribution of instrumentally recorded
earthquakes in this region indicates that more than half of the events are located at depths of
5 – 20 km (Mohajer 1993). Mohajer (1993) reports that 8 of the best instrumentally located
earthquakes in this region are spatially associated with the Burlington-Toronto magnetic
lineament, and that at least 13 earthquakes are spatially associated with the lineament that
defines the western boundary of the zone. However, three of the events associated with the
Burlington-Toronto magnetic lineament are just as likely to be associated with the
Hamilton-Presqu’ile fault, which intersects the zone to the south (Mohajer 1993). Earthquakes
within the Mississauga magnetic domain seismic zone form small clusters that lie partially on
and adjacent to the mapped traces of the zone-bounding lineaments. Seismicity within the
south-central part of the zone appears to trend north-south, oblique to the northeast trend of
the zone. The Southern Ontario Seismic Network (Mereu et al. 1996) has recorded nine
events (mb > 1) within the southern part of the zone since the network began operation in
1991. A number of these events form a northeast-trending alignment that lies within and
approximately parallel to the southern part of the Mississauga magnetic domain seismic zone.
As discussed in Section 2.2, improved station coverage has resulted in a concentration of
epicenters in a 32 km trend of seismicity near the Hamilton area (Asmis et al. 2001).
O’Dowd et al. (2004) have suggested that this cluster of earthquakes in western Lake Ontario
appear to be aligned parallel to the east-northeast-trending magnetic anomalies that
characterise the surrounding rock, and they propose a revised location for the CMBBZ that
trends parallel to and west of the shoreline of Lake Ontario, instead of across western Lake
Ontario, as was previously interpreted by some. Despite the potential viability of this
interpretation, small-magnitude seismicity is found in the vicinity of the Mississauga magnetic
domain seismic zone and must be included in the assessment of its seismogenic potential.
Given the concentration of small-magnitude seismicity in this region, and the partial alignment
of seismicity along the south-central part of the Mississauga magnetic domain seismic zone,
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                        - 104 -                               March 2011
we assign low-to-moderate probability (0.3) to the Mississauga magnetic domain seismic
zone’s being associated with small-magnitude seismicity. Mohajer (1993) has also recorded
small-magnitude seismicity in the area.
It is unknown whether the Mississauga magnetic domain seismic zone is correlative to a
structure at depth. Deep seismic data collected in Lake Ontario (e.g., Forsyth et al. 1994a) did
not cross this feature. Eyles et al. (1993) suggest that the zone coincides with the
Fishog-Cambridge terrane boundary within the Grenville basement, though Carter and Easton
(1990) interpret this boundary to lie considerably west of Lake Ontario. Instrumentally
recorded seismicity within the Toronto-Hamilton seismic zone does extend to a depth of about
20 km (Mohajer 1993). Given the prominent magnetic signature of the feature and the deep
extent of the seismicity, a very high probability (0.9) is assigned the Mississauga magnetic
domain seismic zone’s extending to seismogenic depths.
There is no clear geologic evidence for brittle tectonic faulting within the Mississauga magnetic
domain seismic zone in the present tectonic stress regime. Although west-northwest-trending
pop-up structures in the vicinity of the Burlington-Toronto magnetic lineament indicate buckling
of strata on the bedrock surface consistent with the contemporary northeast-oriented horizontal
compressive stress, these features are not considered to be spatially or structurally associated
with the Mississauga magnetic domain seismic zone. Lewis et al. (1995) have shown that
these features are widely distributed on the flanks of the Lake Ontario basin and are spatially
unrelated to the Burlington-Toronto magnetic lineament and the various other geophysical
lineaments beneath the lake. Thomas et al. (1993) also observed plumose structures and dark
linear features on the bottom of western Lake Ontario and interpreted these features as
indicators of neotectonic activity. They suggested that the plumose structures represent the
surface expression of fracture or fault propagation, and that the dark linear patterns result from
structurally controlled gas injections into the lake-bottom sediments (Thomas et al. 1993).
While processes of this type could indicate the presence of open joints or fractures in the
underlying bedrock, they would not necessarily imply recent brittle tectonic faulting. Lewis et
al. (1995) have reported that the distribution and character of both the linear patterns and
plumose structures do not fully support tectonic origins for the features. Furthermore, Lewis et
al. (1995) have suggested anthropogenic origins for both sets of features, namely, the plumose
structures represent anchor drag marks, and the dark linear patterns may represent steamship
ash debris trains. Considering the lack of clear evidence for brittle tectonic faulting within the
Mississauga magnetic domain seismic zone, we assign a very low probability (0.1) to this
criterion.
No direct data can be used to assess whether multiple episodes of brittle reactivation occurred
in the Mississauga magnetic domain seismic zone. However, the zone appears to be
coincident with a major terrane boundary, and, based on other studies it is judged that such
boundaries can be associated with multiple episodes of reactivation. Therefore, we assign a
moderate probability of 0.4 to reflect this judgment.
Based on our assessment, we arrive at the probability of 0.16 that the Mississauga magnetic
domain seismic zone is seismogenic (See Section 3.2.1 for calculation procedure).
3.4        Seismicity Parameter Characterization for Seismic Sources
The approaches used to model the seismicity parameters are discussed below. The
parameters necessary are the maximum magnitude of earthquakes that can occur associated
with each source and the parameters that define the rate of occurrence and size distribution of
future earthquakes.
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                         - 105 -                                   March 2011
3.4.1     Maximum Magnitude
The primary approach used for assessing the maximum magnitude for a seismic source is the
Bayesian approach developed by Johnston et al. (1994). The process is illustrated on Figure
3.5. With this approach, a prior distribution for maximum magnitude is specified based on
regional knowledge. The prior distribution is then updated with a likelihood function for various
maximum-magnitude values that is based on the catalogue of earthquakes that have occurred
in the seismic source. The resulting posterior distribution is then discretised for use in a logic
tree format.
      Figure 3.5: Illustration of the Bayesian Approach for Assessment of Maximum
                                              Magnitude
The likelihood function for maximum magnitude is derived from the form of the magnitude
distribution used. The likelihood function is based on the premise that the maximum possible
earthquake must be equal to or larger than the maximum size that has already been observed.
For the truncated exponential distribution used in this study, the likelihood function for the
upper-limit magnitude, mu, is:
                                           0                      for m u m observed
                L[m u ]                                                         max
                          1  exp b ln(10)(m u
                                                    m0 )N
                                                                  for m u m observed
                                                                                 max
                                                                                                  (3.3)
where b is the Gutenberg-Richter b-value and N is the number of recorded earthquakes with
                                                          observed
magnitudes larger than a minimum value m0, and mmax                is the largest recorded earthquake.
Figure 3.5 shows an example of this likelihood function. The function has a small peak near
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                         - 106 -                                 March 2011
the maximum observed and then is very flat, indicating that the likelihood is nearly the same
for a large range of values of mu.
Johnston et al. (1994) developed prior distributions for maximum magnitude from a study of
large earthquakes in stable continental regions (SCR). The study led to the development of a
worldwide database of large SCR earthquakes. The SCR crust was subdivided into domains
on the basis of crustal characteristics (e.g., age, type of crust, stress state, and tectonic
history). By pooling like domains, the investigators were able to obtain sufficient numbers of
earthquakes within each “super” domain such that estimates of the maximum magnitude for
each domain type could be made. From these data, Johnston et al. (1994) developed two
types of general prior distributions for mu. Their first approach is based on a simple division of
the SCR into extended and non-extended crust. The statistics of the values of mu for the super
(pooled) domains in each group were used to define a normal distribution for mu. Their second
approach was to develop a regression model relating mu to the characteristics of the super
domains. However, the regression model did not provide much predictive improvement over
the simple statistics. Therefore, only the prior distributions based on the categories of
extended crust and non-extended crust were used to develop maximum magnitude
distributions for this study.
An additional approach was used in this study to assess maximum magnitudes for the local
sources. The maximum dimensions of possible fault ruptures were combined with an empirical
relationship relating fault rupture dimensions to earthquake magnitude. Mohajer (1995)
provided estimates of rupture length for features in the region, and these were used to derive a
distribution for maximum magnitude that is used for the local sources.
3.4.2     Earthquake Occurrence Rates
The frequency of occurrence of earthquakes associated with a source was computed from the
statistics of the earthquake catalogue for the source. For source zones, the standard
truncated exponential magnitude distribution was used to define the relative frequency of
various sizes of earthquakes. This occurrence model contains three parameters: (1) the
annual rate for earthquakes above a specified minimum, N(m0); (2) the Gutenberg-Richter
b-value and (3) the maximum magnitude. The parameters N(m0) and b are estimated from the
earthquake counts in the seismic source zone using the maximum likelihood formulation
developed by Weichert (1980). In this approach, the input data are the period of complete
catalogue reporting and the number of earthquakes for a range of magnitude intervals. As
discussed in Section 2.3.4, the catalogue completeness assessment for the study region
assessed the probability of detection of earthquakes as a function of time. EPRI (1988)
extended the Weichert (1980) approach to incorporate partial catalogue reporting. The
process used is to count all of the earthquakes within the usable portion of the catalogue and
then define an equivalent period of completeness, TE, as:
                                          TE (m)   Ti  Pi D (m)                             (3.4)
                                                     i
where Ti is the length of the i th time interval and PiD(m) is the probability of detection of
earthquakes in magnitude interval m in the i th time interval.
EPRI (1988) also extended the Weichert (1980) formulation to include a prior distribution for
the b-value. This is useful to stabilise the assessment in regions with limited data.

Once the values of N(m0) and b are obtained, a range of possible N(m0) – b pairs are defined
based on the uncertainty estimates for the two parameters. The modified Weichert (1980)
likelihood function is then used to compute the relative likelihood that the observed catalogue
of earthquakes was produced by these N(m0) – b pairs. These relative likelihoods are then
normalised to produce a discrete joint distribution for N(m0) and b that accounts for the
correlation between the two parameters. The process is repeated for each assessed
maximum magnitude for the source to include the effect of mu on the joint N(m0) – b
distribution. Figure 3.6 shows an example of the distribution of earthquake occurrence
computed for a source zone. The observed rate of earthquakes for various magnitude
intervals and the uncertainty in these values are shown by the solid points and vertical error
bars. The discrete set of earthquake occurrence models is shown on the left-hand plot (a),
and the resulting distribution for earthquake occurrence rates is shown on the right-hand plot
(b).
The zoneless approach (Section 3.2.3) uses a somewhat different approach. Based on the
statistics of seismicity across the entire region, 25 bootstrap samples of cell-by-cell seismicity
parameters for each are drawn, in essence, 25 maps of a-values and b-values. These 25 sets
of parameters are used to characterise the uncertainty in seismicity rates for the entire region.
The difference between the two approaches is that in the methodology applied to the zoneless
approach, the b-value is allowed to vary within the source, while in the methodology defined in
Figure 3.6, the b-value is assumed to be the same throughout the source.

3.4.3     Seismicity Parameters for Regional Sources
Figure 3.7 shows the logic tree for the geologic/tectonic regions regional source zones defined
on Plates 1 through 24. As discussed in Section 2.5.4, two alternative catalogue

completeness models were developed that reflect differences in the weight assigned to the
magnitude interval 3.3 ≤ M* < 3.9 in fitting the truncated exponential recurrence model to the
seismicity data: Model A assigns a weight of 0.1 to this magnitude interval, and Model B
assigns a weight of 0.01 (essentially ignoring the data in this interval). These models are given
equal weight in fitting the seismicity parameters, as they both produce similar fits to the
observed occurrence rates for the larger magnitudes of primary interest in assessing the
hazard.
       Figure 3.7: Logic Tree for Geology-Based Source Zone Seismicity Parameters
Following this global branch, seismicity parameter assessments are made for each regional
source zone. The regional sources are all modeled as source zones: the truncated
exponential recurrence model is used to represent the size distribution of earthquakes, and the
ruptures of future earthquakes are assumed to have a random orientation.
The Bayesian methodology (Johnston et al. 1994) is used to estimate maximum magnitude,
resulting in a distribution for maximum magnitudes such as the one shown on Figure 3.5. Two
alternatives for a prior distribution are used. The first is the prior developed by
Johnston et al. (1994) based on crustal category, either mean Mmax M 6.3, σMmax 0.5 for
non-extended crust, or mean Mmax M 6.4, σMmax 0.84 for extended crust. The second is the
same prior with the lower tail truncated at magnitude M 6. The lower tails of the
Johnston et al. (1994) prior distributions extend down to –. A review of the literature,
however, indicates that applying small maximum magnitudes to regional-scale sources does
not reflect the current scientific interpretation of the earthquake potential in central and eastern
North America. This truncated prior is slightly favoured (0.6) over the untruncated prior. The
likelihood function used to update the priors is defined based on the largest observed
earthquake in each source zone. Table 3.5 lists the resulting maximum-magnitude
distributions.

The approach illustrated on Figure 3.6 is used to define the distributions of seismicity
parameters for the zone, and a truncated exponential magnitude distribution is used. The joint
distribution of seismicity parameters is defined by 25 pairs of a-values and b-values.
Two alternative spatial density models for the variation in a-value are used: a uniform spatial
density and a kernel density estimate. The kernel density estimate is strongly preferred (0.9)
to the uniform model (0.1) because most of the zones exhibit evidence of clustering of the
seismicity. A Gaussian kernel was used to model the spatial distribution. Selection of the
kernel-size parameter h controls the balance between accurately portraying the areas of high
seismicity without introducing areas of unrealistically low seismicity in areas of sparse
seismicity. The need to balance these two objectives arises in part from the use of a fixed
kernel size in all parts of the region. Stock and Smith (2002) recommend that an improved
approach is to use adaptive kernel smoothing (Silverman 1986), in which the kernel size is
adjusted throughout the study region, decreasing in size in areas of higher data (earthquake)
density and increasing in size in areas of lower data density. The starting value was selected
by computing the optimum kernel size from the data (Silverman 1986). These values ranged
from 12 to 65 km for earthquakes larger than M* 3.3.
Figure 3.8 shows the logic tree for the seismicity-based source zones shown on Plate 25.
There are two differences between the logic tree and the model for the geology-based source
zones. The first is that the likelihood distribution for updating the maximum-magnitude prior
distribution is based on the largest observed earthquakes in groups of seismic sources, rather
than in each individual source. Grouping was used because the area of the majority of the
individual sources is much smaller than the geologic domains used by Johnston et al. (1994) to
create the prior distributions. The groupings were based on the location of the sources: St.
Lawrence rift system sources, St. Lawrence margin sources, southern Ontario background
region, and the southeastern Canada background region. These maximum magnitude
distributions are listed in Table 3.5. The second difference is that a uniform spatial density is
the only model used for these sources. The sources were defined in part on the basis of
differences in seismicity rate, and use of a uniform spatial distribution maintains that
distinction.
Figure 3.9 shows the logic tree for the zoneless approach. The region is assumed to have the
characteristics of a single source zone, and the Bayesian approach is used to assess the
maximum magnitude. Seismicity parameters are estimated globally for all cells of one degree

longitude and latitude. Twenty-five sets of cell-by-cell a-values and b-values are simulated
from the statistics of the regional fit to the data.

3.4.4     Seismicity Parameters for Local Sources
Figure 3.10 shows the logic tree that is used to characterise the seismicity parameter
assessments for the local sources (Plates 27 and 28). The logic tree again begins with the
global choice of catalogue completeness models. The individual local sources are then
characterized.
              Figure 3.10: Logic Tree for Local Source Seismicity Parameters
The first assessment for a local source is whether or not it is active. These assessments are
described above in Section 3.3. The next assessment is whether to consider it a concentrator
of seismicity, and thus have the characteristics of a zone, or whether to consider it a
through-going fault. The weight assigned to the concentrator (zone) model versus the
through-going fault model is dependent on the local source’s being considered. The GBLZ
and the Mississauga seismic zone appear to have no single fault-like feature, and the zone
model is strongly favoured (0.95) over that of the through-going fault model (0.05). At the
other end of the spectrum, the Clarendon-Linden fault system has been identified as a fault
system, and the through-going fault model is favoured (0.8) for this local source over the zone
model (0.2). The Grenville Front zone, the Niagara-Pickering linear zone, the
Hamilton-Presqu’ile fault, and the Wilson–Port Hope lineament do not display clear evidence of
behaviour as through-going faults in the present tectonic regime, and the zone model is
favoured (0.8) over the fault model (0.2) for these sources.

If the local source is considered a zone, then the Bayesian approach for maximum magnitude
applied to the regional zone in which the local source lies is used to define the maximum
magnitude distribution. The likelihood function used to update the maximum magnitude
distribution is based on the largest observed earthquake in the southern Ontario background
source region shown on Plate 25. The maximum magnitude distribution is listed in Table 3.5.
The seismicity parameters are determined using the approach illustrated on Figure 3.6, and
the truncated exponential magnitude distribution is used. If the local source is considered a
through-going fault, then rupture dimensions are used to assess the maximum magnitude.
The values derived from the assessments of rupture length given by Mohajer (1995) are listed
in Table 3.5. The seismicity rate parameters are assessed in the same way as when the
source is considered a zone, except that the characteristic magnitude distribution is assumed
to apply. This distribution is shown on Figure 3.11.

The seismicity data associated with any single local source is unlikely to provide a tight
constraint on the b-value. Therefore, a prior value is set equal to the value for the region
source zone and a penalised maximum likelihood technique is used to fit the data
(EPRI 1988). Two options are considered for the penalty (weight) assigned to the prior. A
strong prior produces a b-value very similar to the regional value with a similar degree of
uncertainty. A weak prior allows greater variation from the regional b-value and results in
greater uncertainty in the b-value for the local source. These two options are given equal
weight in the hazard model. The spatial distribution of seismicity is assumed to be uniform
along the length of the local source.
The assessment of earthquake occurrence rates is based on the observed rate of earthquakes
obtained from the earthquake catalogue. Following the approach used in Geomatrix (1997a,
b), the number of earthquakes assigned to each local source is obtained by collecting events
that have occurred within 25 km of the source. To avoid double counting of earthquakes in the
assessments of regional and local sources, the events assigned to the local sources were
removed from the catalogue used for calculating the seismicity parameters for the regional
sources. Specifically, the probability that an earthquake is assigned to a local source,
assuming that it occurs within 25 km of the source, is set equal to the probability that the
source is seismogenic. One minus this probability is then the probability that the earthquake
should be counted in the statistics for the regional sources.
3.4.5    Depth Distribution of Earthquakes
The ground motion models used to assess the seismic hazard (see Section 4) use two
measures of source-to-site distance: surface distance and rupture distance. For the rupture
distance measure, the depth of earthquake ruptures is needed. Dineva et al. (2004) and
Ma and Atkinson (2006) provide data on the focal depths of earthquakes in the region.
Ma and Atkinson (2006) divided the data into events occurring north and south of latitude 45º
N, with the northern data set showing somewhat deeper depths. The depth distribution data
from Dineva et al. (2004) are very similar to the southern data set of Ma and Atkinson (2006),
as shown on the left-hand plot of Figure 3.12. The right-hand plot of Figure 3.12 shows the
smoothed depth distributions developed from the published data. These distributions
represent the aleatory variability of the focal depth of future earthquakes. Rupture areas are
assumed to be centered on the focal depth for the purpose of computing rupture distance.
3.4.6    Comparison of Observed and Predicted Seismicity Rates
Figure 3.13, Figure 3.14, Figure 3.15 and Figure 3.16 compare the observed and predicted
seismicity rates within 100, 200, 300 and 500 km of the Bruce nuclear site, respectively. At all
distances, the seismic hazard model provides a reasonably good representation of the
observed seismicity rates. The uncertainty in the predicted rates is highest in the vicinity of the
site where the observed rate of earthquakes is low. The larger uncertainty is due to the limited
data sample, as few earthquakes have been recorded within 100 and 200 km of the site.

4.        GROUND MOTION PREDICTION EQUATIONS FOR CENTRAL AND EASTERN
          NORTH AMERICA
Completion of the probabilistic seismic hazard model for the Bruce nuclear site requires
specification of earthquake ground motions. In most PSHA applications, earthquake ground
motions are specified in terms of ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs). There are two
necessary components of a GMPE. The first is a relationship for the median amplitude
(mean log amplitude) of peak ground motions as a function of earthquake magnitude,
source-to-site distance, and spectral frequency of interest, as well as other explanatory
variables that may be appropriate. The second and equally important component is a
relationship for the aleatory variability (random variation) of peak ground motions about the
median amplitude.
In areas of active tectonic and high seismicity rates, GMPEs are often based on analyses of
recorded strong ground motion. In central and eastern North America (CENA), however,
recorded strong-motion data is very limited. As a result, the available ground-motion models
are primarily based on theoretical/numerical modelling approaches that have been calibrated
using comparisons with recorded data from more active regions, in addition to the relatively
sparse CENA data. Section 4.1 discusses the selection of an appropriate set of such models
for the analysis of the seismic hazard at the Bruce nuclear site. These models are developed
to represent surface motions on generic CENA hard rock sites. Completion of the site hazard
assessment requires specification of the motions at depth in the Bruce nuclear site-specific
geology. This specification is discussed in Section 5.3. Specification of the aleatory variability
in the peak ground motions is discussed in Section 4.2. As with the seismic source model,
there is uncertainty in specification of the appropriate GMPEs. The representation of that
uncertainty in the seismic hazard model is discussed in Section 4.3.
4.1       Selection of Models for Median Ground Motions
During the past two decades, a substantial amount of research effort has been focused on
developing strong ground-motion models for the stable continental regions of CENA. Because
of the limited strong-motion database, these models have been developed from analysis of
seismographic network data (e.g., Atkinson and Mereu 1992) and the use of numerical
ground-motion models (e.g., Boore and Atkinson 1987, Atkinson and Boore 1995, 2006, EPRI
1993). More recently, Campbell (2003) has developed a hybrid ground-motion model that
used numerical modelling and network data to transfer empirical ground-motion models
developed in active tectonic regimes to conditions in the central and eastern United States
(CEUS).
In 2004, EPRI performed an evaluation of the ground motion models available at that time in
order to characterise ground motion modelling for application to safety studies for nuclear
power plants. EPRI’s approach was to group the available models into clusters defined by the
general approach used for the model development. EPRI (2004) then developed a
representative model for each cluster, as well as a characterization of the epistemic
uncertainty in the ground motion models for each cluster.
The conceptual approach used by EPRI in 2004 is followed in this study using the most recent
versions of the ground motion models representative of the EPRI clusters. The
Atkinson and Boore (2006) model is an update of the previous model
(Atkinson and Boore 1995) that was used in the EPRI (2004) study. This updated model uses
additional constraints on wave propagation from the analysis of empirical data, and uses the
stochastic finite-fault numerical modelling approach in place of the point-source stochastic
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                       - 122 -                              March 2011
simulation technique. The Atkinson and Boore (2006) model includes a characterization of
epistemic uncertainty in the median predictions.
The Silva et al. (2003) model is also an update of one of the models used in the EPRI (2004)
study. This model is a point-source, stochastic model that represents an update of the model
and modelling approach followed by EPRI in 1993 and Toro et al. in 1997. The single-corner
variable-stress-drop set of models from Silva et al. (2003) was selected for this study because
these models provide better calibration with empirical models. The Silva et al. (2003) model
also includes a characterization of epistemic uncertainty in the median predictions.
The third model selected was the Campbell (2003) hybrid model described above.
Campbell (2003) also developed a characterization of epistemic uncertainty in the median
prediction models.
The fourth type of model (Somerville et al. 2001) used in the EPRI (2004) study was one
based on full numerical modelling of the source and path. The Somerville et al. (2001) model
was somewhat limited in its application, however, because it did not include earthquakes in the
magnitude range of M 5 to 6, and these events often have a large contribution to the hazard at
sites in CENA. The Atkinson and Boore (2006) model incorporated finite-fault modelling
techniques used by Somerville et al. (2001), thus providing representation of this modelling
approach in the ground motion set.
A new model developed by Atkinson (2008) was included. This model is based on comparing
the strong motion data for CENA earthquakes with the predictions provided by a
well-constrained empirical model for active tectonic regions, in this case the Next Generation
Attenuation (NGA) model of Boore and Atkinson (2008). An algebraic relationship is fitted to
the residuals from this comparison, providing an adjustment factor from active tectonic regions
to CENA. The approach is somewhat analogous to the hybrid model, except that the
adjustment from western North America (WNA) to CENA is based primarily on CENA
recordings rather than numerical modelling.
The four ground-motion models are compared on Figure 4.1 and Figure 4.2 in terms of the
attenuation of peak ground acceleration and 1 Hz spectral acceleration, respectively. Figure
4.3 compares the GMPEs in terms of the predicted response spectra for M 5 and M 7
earthquakes. The four models compare reasonably well, although the Atkinson (2008)
reference empirical model tends to predict lower motions at longer spectral periods.
4.2       Selection of Model for Aleatory Variability
Specification of the aleatory variability about the median ground-motion predictions for the
modelling-based GMPEs had typically been based on the results of parametric variability in the
parameters. EPRI (1993) and Toro et al. (1997) developed a model for aleatory variability
based on representation of the parametric uncertainty in ground-motion modelling predictions
combined with an added component from model misfit in calibration studies. The resulting
values of epistemic uncertainty were somewhat larger than typical values found for empirical
ground-motion data in WNA. Silva et al. (2003) applied the same approach in developing their
GMPEs, with similar results.

More recently, EPRI (2006) performed an extensive analysis of the basis for assessing the
proper aleatory variability (sigma) to assign to CENA ground-motion models. The study
concluded that empirically based estimates from active tectonic regions are appropriate for
CENA ground motions with some minor adjustments. That approach has been followed in
assigning aleatory variability models for this study. Table 4.1 lists the average of the aleatory
variability values for the five recently published NGA empirical models developed for active
tectonic regions (Abrahamson and Silva 2008, Boore and Atkinson 2008, Campbell and
Bozorgnia 2008, Chiou and Youngs 2008, Idriss 2008). Values are listed for M 5 and M 7
earthquakes as three of the relationships include magnitude-dependent aleatory variability.
Following the approach used in EPRI (2006), these values are adjusted for application to
CENA by slightly increasing the earthquake-to-earthquake variability and increasing the
high-frequency (>10 Hz) values to account for the increased high-frequency content of CENA
ground motions.

4.3       Representation of Epistemic Uncertainty
Figure 4.4 shows the logic tree structure used to characterise epistemic uncertainty in the
specification of CENA ground motions in the Bruce PSHA. The Atkinson and Boore (2006),
Campbell (2003), and Silva et al. (2003) models are given equal weight (0.3 each). Previous
versions of two of these models were given roughly comparable weights to the
Campbell (2003) hybrid model in the EPRI (2004) study. Equal weights are considered a
reasonable approximation to the EPRI (2004) results. The Atkinson (2008) referenced
empirical model is given lower weight (0.1) in part because of its newness and lack of
experience in its application. The Atkinson (2008) model is also specified at only a limited
number of spectral periods, requiring significant interpolation of coefficients in order to apply it
to the analysis. The model was included in the PSHA following the intent of its developer to
use it to more fully represent the epistemic uncertainty in modelling CENA ground motions.

The Atkinson and Boore (2006), Campbell (2003), and Silva et al. (2003) models all include
characterization of epistemic uncertainty in the median motions. We have used the three-point
discrete distribution developed by Keefer and Bodily (1983) to represent that uncertainty with three
alternatives: a median model with a weight of 0.63, and 5th and 95th percentile models with
weights of 0.185 each. The Atkinson (2008) model contains two estimates of the median
adjustment from WNA to CENA, and these two estimates are given equal weight in the ground
motion modelling.

Figure 4.5 shows the epistemic uncertainties in median ground motions that result from
implementing the logic tree shown on Figure 4.4. The epistemic uncertainty, σμ, is defined as
the standard deviation (natural log units) of the weighted median ground-motion predictions as
a function of magnitude and distance for two spectral periods. As a comparison,
Peterson et al. (2008) used values of σμ in the range of 0.15 to 0.25 (90 percent confidence
interval ranges of 0.25 to 0.4 natural log units, respectively) to characterise the epistemic
uncertainty in GMPEs for WNA. The much larger values for CENA reflect the fact that there is
very limited empirical strong-motion data available to constrain CENA ground motions.

4.4      Comparison with Ground Motion Modesl Used for NBCC
Adams and Halchuk (2003) and Halchuk and Adams (2008) develop seismic hazard values for
Canada for use in the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC). These hazard values were
computed using models based on the quadratic form GMPE published by
Atkinson and Boore (2005). Figure 4.6 and 4-7 compare the ground motions predicted by the
quadratic GMPE of Atkinson and Boore (1995) to those predicted by the GMPEs selected for
use in this study. For PGA, the Atkinson and Boore (1995) quadratic GMPE predicts
somewhat higher ground motions than the average of the models used in this study. For 1 Hz
spectral acceleration, the Atkinson and Boore (1995) quadratic GMPE predicts somewhat
lower ground motions than the average of the models used in this study. The Atkinson and
Boore (1995) GMPE has been updated by the Atkinson and Boore (2006) GMPE used in this
study. The updated Atkinson and Boore model predicts lower ground motions that the earlier
1995 model. Based on its more recent publication date, the Atkinson and Boore (2006) GMPE
is considered an update of the Atkinson and Boore (1995) GMPE, and thus more
representative of the current knowledge for ground motion prediction in ENA.

5.        PROBABILISTIC SEISMIC HAZARD ANALYSIS AND DESIGN GROUND
          MOTIONS
The development of design ground motions for the Bruce nuclear site was accomplished in a
two-stage process. The first stage involved performing a PSHA using the seismic sources
described in Section 3.0 and the ground motion models described in Section 4.0. The second
stage involved developing site-specific hazard results using the dynamic properties of the
Bruce nuclear site. The following sections describe the approaches used to perform the two
analyses, the results of the PSHA for the reference site conditions, and the development of the
site-specific design ground motions.
5.1       PSHA Analysis Approach
5.1.1     Analysis for Reference Site Conditions
The mathematical formulation used in most PSHAs assumes that the occurrence of damaging
earthquakes can be represented as a Poisson process. Under this assumption, the probability
that a ground motion parameter, Z, will exceed a specified value, z, in time period t is given by:
                                                                                            (5.1)
where (z) is the average frequency during time period t at which the level of ground motion
parameter Z exceeds value z at the site from all earthquakes on all sources in the region.
Equation 5.1 is valid provided that (z) is the appropriate average value for time period t. In
this study, the hazard results are reported in terms of the frequency of exceedance (z).
The frequency of exceedance, (z), is a function of the frequency of earthquake occurrence,
the randomness of size and location of future earthquakes, and the randomness in the level of
ground motion that future earthquakes may produce at the site. It is computed by the
expression:
                                                                                            (5.2)
where n(m0) is the frequency of earthquakes on source n above a minimum magnitude of
engineering significance, m0; f(m) is the probability density of earthquake size between m0 and
a maximum earthquake the source can produce, mu; f(rm) is the probability density function
for distance to an earthquake of magnitude m occurring on source n; and P(Z>zm,r) is the
probability that, given an earthquake of magnitude m at distance r from the site, the peak
ground motion will exceed level z. The frequency of earthquake occurrence, n(m0), and the
size distribution of earthquakes, f(m), were determined by the earthquake recurrence
relationships developed in Section 3.0. The distribution for the distance between the
earthquake rupture and the site was determined by the geometry of the seismic sources
defined in Chapter 3. The conditional probability of exceedance, P(Z>zm,r), was determined
using the ground motion prediction equations described in Section 4.0. The attenuation
relationships defined the level of ground motion in terms of a lognormal distribution. Based on
the studies presented in EPRI (2006), the ground motion distributions were not truncated in the
PSHA calculation.
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                        - 133 -                                March 2011
The seismic hazard model for the site region developed in Sections 3 and 4 treats all of the
parameters of Equation (5.2) as uncertain and specifies discrete probability functions for each
one. The result is a large number of alternative parameter sets, each with a finite probability
that it represents the “correct” parameter set. The computation of (z) is made for a particular
parameter set, and the result is assigned the probability associated with that parameter set.
The process is repeated over all parameter sets, producing a discrete probability density for
the frequency of exceedance, (z). The probability density for (z) is then used to compute the
mean or expected hazard and various percentiles of the distribution that define the uncertainty
in the hazard given the uncertainty in the input parameters.
The computational scheme used to compute the hazard involves replacing the integrals of
Equation (5.2) with summations over 0.1 unit magnitude and small distance intervals
(e.g., 1 km for distances less than 100 km). The distance density function, f(rm), was
computed numerically over each source region (assuming either a uniform density or a
spatially varying density computed using a Gaussian kernel density estimator), assuming that
each earthquake has a finite rupture length dependent on magnitude and that the orientation of
the rupture is random. The local sources were modelled as a set of parallel line sources with a
width of 10 km to address the uncertainty in the location of the actual source. The probability
function P(Z>zm,r) was computed assuming that peak ground motions are lognormally
distributed about the specified attenuation relationships.
The generic hard-rock hazard was computed using a fixed lower-bound magnitude (m0 in
Equation 5.2) of M 5.0. This magnitude is generally considered to be the lowest magnitude
that has the potential to cause damage to well-engineered structures. The distance density
functions were computed consistent with the distance measure used in the attenuation
relationships. Earthquake rupture orientations were assumed to be random in the areal source
zones and aligned parallel to the long dimension of the local sources.
Distributions for the annual frequency of exceeding various levels of spectral acceleration
(PSA) were computed for nine spectral frequencies: PGA (set at 100 Hz), 40 Hz, 25 Hz, 10 Hz,
5 Hz, 2.5 Hz, 1 Hz, 0.5 Hz and 0.25 Hz. At each ground motion level, the complete set of
results forms a discrete distribution for frequency of exceedance, (z). The computed
distributions were used to obtain the mean frequency of exceeding various levels of peak
ground motion (mean hazard curve) as well as hazard curves representing various percentiles
of the distributions. The logic trees represent a best judgment as to the uncertainty in defining
the input parameters, and thus the computed distributions represent the implied confidence in
the output, the estimated hazard.
5.1.2     Site-Specific Hazard for Horizontal Motions
Site-specific seismic hazard results for the Bruce site were obtained using what is called
Approach 3 in McGuire et al. (2001, 2002). The approach is also described in
Bazzurro and Cornell (2004). In this approach, the hazard at the various repository horizons is
computed by integrating the hazard curve for the reference site condition with the probability
distribution for the transfer function that defines the ground motion at a specific repository
horizon relative to those on a reference site condition. For the Bruce nuclear site study, the
reference site condition is central and eastern North America (CENA) hard rock with a surface
shear-wave velocity of 2.83 km/sec (EPRI 1993, 2004). The Bruce nuclear site-specific
amplification relative to this reference site is characterised by a suite of frequency-dependent
amplification factors that can account for any nonlinearity in response. Approach 3 involves
approximations to the hazard integration using suites of transfer functions, which result in
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                         - 134 -                                March 2011
complete hazard curves at the repository horizons for specific ground-motion parameters
(e.g., PGA) at a range of frequencies.
The basis for Approach 3 is a modification of Equation 5.2 to incorporate the additional
integration over a probabilistic amplification into the hazard integral:
                                                                                               (5.3)
In Equation 5-3, x is the ground motion level on the reference site and z is the ground motion
level at the site horizon of interest. Parameter AF is the probabilistic amplification factor that
transfers amplitude X on the reference site to amplitude Z on the site of interest, AF = Z/X. In
theory, it is a function of the amplitude and relative frequency content of the ground motions,
and thus would depend upon m, r and x.
Equation 5-3 represents full incorporation of all the variables into a single integration such that
one does not actually compute the hazard curve, (x), for the reference site condition. In
practice, Approach 3 implements Equation 5.3 in steps. The hazard is computed for the
reference site condition. This provides information on the range of m, r and x of importance for
defining the relative amplification AF. The probabilistic AF is then combined with the reference
site hazard results (x) to produce the site-specific hazard (z). As such, Equation 5.3 is
rewritten as:
                                                                                               (5.4)
where f(x) is the absolute value of the derivative of the hazard curve for the reference site, and
f(m,rx) is the joint distribution of m and r for events contributing to the reference site hazard at
level x obtained from deaggregation of the hazard curve.
Equation 5.3 can be simplified, depending on how sensitive AF is to changes in m, r and x.
McGuire et al. (2001) indicate that the effect of variations in r for given values of m and x is
usually insignificant, which is to be expected as x and r are highly correlated for a given value
of m. This leads to the form implemented in this study:
                                                                                               (5.5)
In the actual computation, Equation 5.5 is implemented in discretised form as
(e.g., Bazzurro and Cornell 2004):
                                                                                               (5.6)
In Equation 5.6, p(xj) is obtained by differencing the hazard curve [p(xj) =  (x-Δx) –  (x+Δx)],
and p(mkxj) is the discrete magnitude deaggregation of the hazard at ground motion level xj.
Depending on the variation of AF with m and the range of magnitudes contributing to the
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                         - 135 -                                March 2011
hazard, p(mkxj) may be specified at a few discrete magnitude values. Assuming that AF is
lognormally distributed, given mk and xj, leads to the expression:
                                                                                                (5.7)
where               and σln[AF](mk,xj) are the conditional mean and standard deviation of the
natural log of AF at the values mk and xj. These are computed by developing probabilistic
representations of the site properties; generating one suite of randomised profiles that
represent the randomness of the reference site and another suite of profiles that represent the
randomness of the site of interest; computing the response of both suites to an appropriate set
of values of mk and xj; and then computing the statistics of the relative response. Epistemic
uncertainty in the characterization of the site properties is incorporated by developing
alternative sets of parameters with their associated weights, computing the resulting
site-specific hazard for each set, and then computing the weighted mean in the same way that
uncertainty in characterising the seismic source models and reference-site ground-motion
models is treated.
5.1.3     Application to Vertical Site-Specific Hazard
Typically, the vertical uniform hazard response spectrum (UHRS) is developed by a
deterministic application of V/H ratios applied to the horizontal UHRS. Since V/H ratios vary
with both magnitude and distance for sites with nonlinear response and with distance for linear
sites (e.g., hard rock; Silva 1997, McGuire et al. 2001), it is essential to capture these
dependencies, identified through modal deaggregations, in developing the vertical UHRS. For
the deterministic approach, conservative estimates of appropriate V/H ratios must be used to
ensure achievement of the same hazard levels and target performance goals as the horizontal
UHRS. Additionally, V/H ratios reflect epistemic variability, as is evidenced by western North
America (WNA) empirical soft rock and deep firm soil V/H ratios (Abrahamson and Shedlock
1997), further pointing out the necessity of conservatism in a deterministic approach to
developing vertical UHRS. Incorporation of epistemic variability in a deterministic framework is
not unambiguous, as one cannot simply average over suites of motions or transfer functions
that reflect epistemic variability. This process will not generally achieve desired hazard levels,
and reliance on conservatism in V/H ratios remains the most reliable option. These
considerations, along with a desire for easy implementation as a function of expected
horizontal PGA, led to the purposeful incorporation of conservatism in the development of the
CENA hard-rock V/H ratios (McGuire et al. 2001).
To accurately achieve desired hazard levels as well as performance goals, a fully probabilistic
approach was used, directly paralleling that for the horizontal hazard. Implementation of the
full integration Approach 3 (Section 5.1.2) for vertical hazard simply substitutes V/H ratios for
horizontal amplification factors. In this case, the distribution of V/H ratios is integrated with the
horizontal site-specific hazard curves (presumably developed using Approach 3). As with the
horizontal case, Approach 3 then admits the proper and unambiguous incorporation of both
aleatory variability and epistemic uncertainty in V/H ratios, achieving desired hazard levels.
Again, in parallel with the development of the horizontal hazard, modal deaggregations are

used, but as previously stated, in addition to magnitude, source distance is required as V/H
ratios depend on both magnitude and distance for soil or soft-rock site conditions.
5.2       Results of the PSHA for Reference Site Conditions
Figure 5.1, Figure 5.2 and Figure 5.3 show the hazard results for PGA (100 Hz PSA), 10 Hz
and 1 Hz spectral acceleration (PSA), respectively. The ground motion measures span the
frequency range of primary interest. The plots on Figure 5.1 through Figure 5.3 show the
mean hazard curves defining the mean frequency of exceeding specified ground-motion levels
over all of the sources of uncertainty defined in Sections 3 and 4. The range in the results is
shown by curves defining the 5th, 16th, 50th (median), 84th and 95th percentiles of the
distributions for frequency of exceedance computed from the logic tree. These percentile
hazard curves define confidence intervals for the hazard resulting from uncertainties in
specifying the inputs to the analysis. The results shown are typical of seismic hazard
estimates in CENA in that there is a wide confidence band reflecting the large uncertainties in
most of the input parameters. The results are also typical in that the distribution for frequency
of exceedance is skewed such that the mean hazard lies above the central point (median) of
the distribution, and the amount of skewness increases with increasing peak ground-motion
level.
5.2.1     Contributions to Mean Hazard
Figure 5.4, Figure 5.5 and Figure 5.6 show the total mean hazard curves from Figure 5.1,
Figure 5.2 and Figure 5.3, respectively, together with the mean hazard curves for the regional
and local sources. These results indicate that the regional sources are the dominant
contributors to the hazard at all ground motion levels. The relative contribution of the local
sources increases somewhat for 1 Hz hazard because of the potential of these features to
have fault-like behaviour, with relatively more frequent large-magnitude earthquakes. This
effect can be seen on Figure 5.7, Figure 5.8 and Figure 5.9, which show the hazard from the
individual local sources. Of the local sources, the Clarendon-Linden fault has among the
highest contributions, even though it is the most distant. This high contribution is a result of
the relatively larger probability that it is active (0.4) and has a high weight on fault-like
behaviour. This effect is illustrated in Section 5.2.2.
Another way of examining the contributions to the hazard is to deaggregate the results to show
the relative contributions from earthquakes in individual magnitude and distance increments.
Deaggregation of the hazard is displayed on Figure 5.10, Figure 5.11 and Figure 5.12 for PGA,
10 Hz PSA and 1 Hz PSA motions, respectively. Shown are histograms of the relative
contributions of earthquakes in 1/2 magnitude intervals and a range of distance intervals to the
hazard at ground motions with annual exceedance frequencies of 10–2, 10–4 and 10–6. At an
exceedance frequency of 10–2, the major contribution is from distant earthquakes.
Larger-magnitude events dominate the 1 Hz hazard (Figure 5.12a), reflecting the fact that
larger earthquakes produce relatively greater low-frequency motion than smaller earthquakes
(see Figure 4.1, Figure 4.2 and Figure 4.3). As the exceedance frequency decreases, the
hazard contributions shift to earthquakes at closer distances, reflecting the fact that earthquake
ground motions increase as the source-to-site distance decreases. This effect is strongest for
the PGA and 10 Hz hazard. The majority of earthquakes contributing to the 1 Hz hazard at an
exceedance frequency of 10–6 remain large-magnitude distant events because of their
potential to induce larger motions and their much higher occurrence frequency compared to
similar events in the vicinity of the Bruce nuclear site. At an annual exceedance frequency

(AEF) of 10–6, the contributions to the PGA and 10 Hz hazard are dominated by earthquakes
within 15 km of the site, including events occurring at depth in the immediate site vicinity.

5.2.2         Contributions to Uncertainty
The fractile hazard results shown on Figure 5.1, Figure 5.2 and Figure 5.3 represent the
variation in hazard over all of the alternative model parameters defined by the seismic hazard
model characterization. The contribution of individual assessments to the uncertainty in the
hazard can be displayed by selecting a node of the logic tree and computing the mean hazard,
giving each branch in succession a weight of unity, and all of the other branches at that node a
weight of zero.

5.2.2.1         Ground Motion Model
The uncertainty in ground motion modelling was characterised by specifying four alternative
ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs). Figure 5.13, Figure 5.14 and Figure 5.15
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                              - 147 -                                       March 2011
compare the hazard from all sources computed, assuming that each of the four GMPEs is the
“correct” model. All four GMPEs produce similar PGA and 10 Hz hazard results. The spread
among the results for the four GMPEs is larger for 1 Hz hazard and contributes a large part of
the hazard uncertainty. The Atkinson (2008) GMPE produces lower hazard than the other
models, consistent with its lower estimate of 1 Hz PSA. The Campbell (2003) hybrid model
produces the highest hazard estimates.

Figure 5.16, Figure 5.17 and Figure 5.18 show the contributions of the epistemic uncertainty in
the median GMPE to the uncertainty in the hard-rock hazard. For PGA and 10 Hz hazard, the
contribution of uncertainty in the median for each of the GMPEs to the overall uncertainty is
larger than the contribution from the variability among four GMPEs. For 1 Hz hazard, the
reverse is the case.

5.2.2.2           Regional Source Models
Figure 5.19, Figure 5.20 and Figure 5.21 show the effect of the three alternative regional
source models on the hazard from regional sources. The hazard results for the seismotectonic
branch are shown for the case where kernel smoothing is used and for the case where a
uniform spatial distribution is assumed within each source zone. The highest hazard is
obtained using a uniform spatial distribution within each seismotectonic source zone. This
results from averaging the higher seismicity rates that occur at large distances from the site
with the low local rate. The GSC H-Model produces the next highest hazard. This model also
uses uniform seismicity rates, but areas of higher seismicity are defined as separate source
zones such that the seismicity in the site vicinity represents the average rate over only the
lower seismicity areas in southeast Canada. The zoneless approach produces the lowest
hazard because it defines a local rate and b-value representing the conditions in the site
vicinity, where there are few earthquakes to define the seismicity parameters. The effect of the
alternative models for distributed seismicity is larger for PGA and 10 Hz hazard than for 1 Hz
hazard because the hazard for these ground motion measures is controlled by the local
seismicity.

Figure 5.22, Figure 5.23 and Figure 5.24 show the impact of the alternative prior distributions
used to develop maximum magnitude distributions on the computed total hazard. Two

alternatives are used, an untruncated prior and a prior that is truncated in the lower tail to limit
the maximum magnitudes to M 6 and larger. There is little difference in the hazard computed
from these two models.
5.2.2.4    Local Source Model
The largest source of uncertainty related to the local sources is the question of whether an
individual local source is seismogenic. The hazard results for the individual sources shown on
Figure 5.7, Figure 5.8 and Figure 5.9 are weighted mean hazard curves. The mean frequency
of exceedance at any ground motion level is directly proportional to the probability the source
is seismogenic. Thus changing the probability that an individual source is seismogenic would
produce a corresponding change in the mean hazard from the source. The effect of an
increase in the probability of activity would be partially offset by the fact that the earthquakes
spatially associated with the source would no longer be used to estimate the seismicity rate in
the surrounding regional seismic sources.
Two alternatives were considered for modelling the characteristics of the local sources. One
approach was to consider that the local sources act as concentrations of seismicity in the
regional zones and thus have the attributes of the host regional zone. Under this assumption,
the magnitude distribution was assumed to conform to a truncated exponential distribution
appropriate for regions, and the maximum magnitude distribution was assumed to be the same
as that of the regional zone in which the source lies.
The other approach was to assume that the local sources act truly as individual faults with
unique individual attributes. Under the fault-like assumption, the magnitude distribution was
assumed to conform to the “characteristic” magnitude model (Youngs and Coppersmith 1985),
and the maximum magnitude distribution was estimated from postulated maximum rupture
dimensions. Consideration of fault-like behaviour resulted in larger maximum magnitudes and
a much higher predicted frequency of large events. As a result, the alternative modelling
assumptions for the local sources have a major impact on the hazard from these sources, as
illustrated on Figure 5.25, Figure 5.26 and Figure 5.27. The 5th percentile hazard from local
sources does not appear on these plots because the combined probability that none of them
are active is greater than 5 percent.
5.2.2.5    Summary of Contributions to Uncertainty
Figure 5.28, Figure 5.29 and Figure 5.30 present the contributions to the uncertainty in the
computed hazard resulting from the uncertainties in the various components of the PSHA
model. Each plot shows the percentage of the total variance in the computed frequency of
exceedance contributed by the uncertainty in each of the model components. These results,
which are presented for 10–2, 10–4 and 10–6 annual frequencies of exceedance, indicate that
uncertainty in the ground motion models is the largest contributor to uncertainty in the
computed hazard. The aspects of seismic source characterization that have the largest
contribution to uncertainty in the hazard are the alternative spatial distribution models used for
the seismotectonic sources and uncertainty in the maximum magnitude and b-value.
5.2.2.6    Hard Rock UHRS
The mean hazard results for the nine spectral frequencies were interpolated to obtain pgs at
annual exceedance frequencies (AEFs) from 10–2 to 10–8. The resulting values form UHRS
representing ground motions on an outcrop of generic hard rock. Figure 5.31 shows the
resulting UHRS and the spectral accelerations are listed in Table 5.1. The shape of the 10–2

AEF spectrum is indicative of the large contribution of distant sources to the hazard at all
spectral frequencies. As the exceedance frequency decreases, the UHRS become more
peaked, reflecting increasing contribution of nearby smaller earthquakes to the hazard.

5.2.2.7                               Comparison with National Building Code of Canada Seismic Hazard Values
The UHRS for the reference hard rock site conditions for an annual exceedance frequency of
4x10-4 (return period of 2,500 years) is compared with the hazard values reported for the
National Building Code of Canada (Halchuk and Adams 2008) on Figure 5.32. The values
reported in (Halchuk and Adams 2008) are for site conditions C. These values were adjusted
to hard rock conditions using the amplification factors listed in Table 2 of
Adams and Halchuk (2003). The NBCC seismic hazard values are based on PSHA
calculations performed using the quadratic ground motion model published in
Atkinson and Boore (1995). As shown on Figure 4.6 and Figure 4.7, the Atkinson and Boore
(1995) quadratic ground motion model predicts generally higher ground motions at high
frequencies than the more recent models used in this study. To examine this effect, the
seismic hazard values for the Bruce nuclear site were recomputed using the Atkinson and
Boore (1995) quadratic ground motion model. The resulting 4x10-4 annual exceedance
frequency UHRS is shown on Figure 5.32. The computed values are close to those reported
for the NBCC. Thus, the differences in hazard results between the two studies are attributed
primarily to differences in the ground motion models. The ground motion models used in this

hysteretic damping relationships for the subsurface materials.
5.3.1.1     Site-Specific Profiles
The Bruce nuclear site profile consists of a shallow, stiff Pleistocene soil layer of varying
thickness overlying firm to hard sedimentary rock composed largely of dolomites, shales and
limestones. The sedimentary rock column extends to a depth of approximately 860 m, where it
is underlain by Precambrian granitic gneiss basement (Sterling 2010), as illustrated on Figure
5.33. The proposed repository horizon is located at a depth of approximately 680 m (Figure
5.33), with the site having a lateral extent of approximately 1 to 2 km.

As part of the site characterization, boreholes were drilled and compressional- and shear-wave
velocities measured at five locations, DGR-1 through 4 and US-3, as shown on Figure 5.33. At
boreholes DGR-1 through 4, velocities were determined by suspension log
(Pehme and Melaney 2010), while at the shallow US-3 borehole, the downhole method was
used. In the first step, to develop base-case profiles, the suspension log profiles were
smoothed and plotted with the shallow downhole profile as shown on Figure 5.34 for both
shear and compressional waves. The comparison of the smoothed suspension log profiles
revealed little lateral variability as well as general consistency with the shallow downhole
profiles. In the second step, to develop the base-case shear- and compressional-wave
profiles, the smoothed profiles were averaged with equal weights, as illustrated on Figure 5.35.
The very high shear-wave velocity approaching 4,500 m/sec at a depth near 50 m seen in the
downhole profile (Figure 5.34) was considered a very local feature and averaged with the
shallowest suspension log profile (Figure 5.34). Finally, the base-case profiles shown on
Figure 5.35 were developed as a sequence of constant velocity layers to capture the
significant changes in velocity with depth while maintaining the travel times of the average
profiles (Figure 5.35). As an additional constraint in developing the layered profiles, Poisson

ratios of the base-case profiles were examined for general consistency with those of the
smoothed profiles. The base-case shear- and compressional-wave velocities are listed in
Table 5.2 along with the layer thicknesses.

Lateral Variability
To accommodate the potential impacts of changes in thickness of the very shallow soils and
firm rock across the repository on both the surface, and at-depth, design motions, three
base-case profiles were developed. In developing the three profiles, location US-3 on the
cross section illustrated on Figure 5.33 was taken to reflect an average thickness of shallow

materials over the area of the repository that has the largest accumulation of soils and firm
rock conditions. The Pleistocene soils and shallow firm rock materials were taken as layers
one and two for shear waves and layers one to three for compressional waves in the downhole
and base-case profiles shown on Figure 5.34 and Figure 5.35 (Table 5.2). The full profile as
listed in Table 5.2 was designated profile 1 (P1), while the thinning of the shallow materials
was modelled by removing the stiff soils and firm rock layers in two steps. In the first step, the
Pleistocene soil, considered to be reflected in the top two layers of the shear-wave profile with
velocities of 590 m/sec over a depth of 15 m (Table 5.2), was removed to form an alternative
base-case profile (P2) with firm rock outcropping. The third base-case profile (P3) consisted of
removal of the next layer of firm rock with a shear-wave velocity of 1,860 m/sec (Table 5.2).
       Notes: DGR-1, -2, -3, and -4, and US-3, -7, and -8 boreholes are projected onto a schematic cross-
       section to show depths of penetration of suspension logging into the Paleozoic stratigraphy beneath the
       Bruce nuclear site. The figure is modified from INTERA (2011). Proposed repository depth at 680 m is
       also indicated.
                 Figure 5.33: Subsurface Stratigraphy at the Bruce Nuclear Site
To properly accommodate the deterministic variation of shallow materials across the repository
(Figure 5.33), site specific hazard curves and corresponding UHRS were developed for each
profile (P1, P2 and P3). Final design motions that are appropriate for any location across the
repository should then reflect an envelope of hazard developed for each profile. Alternatively,

to reduce conservatism for cases were large differences exist reflecting the effects of using
profiles 1, 2 and 3, the repository may be microzoned. Such a process necessitates
location-specific determination of the presence or absence of the shallow materials.

Reference Site
The reference site conditions of the suite of GMPEs (Section 4.0) used in the PSHA
(Section 5.2) reflect hard-rock basement material in CENA. The hard-rock reference site has
been quantified with a generic crustal model appropriate for CENA and is listed in Table 5.2
(EPRI 1993). The shear-wave velocity at the surface of the crustal model is 2.83 km/sec, as
was taken to reflect conditions at a depth of about 750 m in the site-specific profile (Figure
5.35).
5.3.1.2     Nonlinear Dynamic Material Properties
To accommodate the possible nonlinear dynamic response of the shallow materials at the site,
equivalent-linear analyses were used for the horizontal site response in the top three layers of
the shear-wave velocity profile (Table 5.2). At shear-wave velocities of 590 m/sec, reflecting
very stiff soil or soft rock and 1,860 m/sec reflecting firm rock, some degree of nonlinearity may
be expected at high loading levels (low AEF). The remaining profile was considered to be
sufficiently stiff to permit linear analyses.

For the equivalent-linear analyses, generic soil shear modulus reduction (G/ Gmax) and
hysteretic damping curves were used (EPRI 1993). These curves were intended to capture
potential nonlinearity in the shallow soils as well as in soft and firm rock. The EPRI curves
have been validated by modelling recorded motions at soil and rock sites in western North
America (Silva et al. 1996). The EPRI (1993) G/Gmax and hysteretic damping curves are
shown on Figure 5.36. To capture epistemic variability (uncertainty in mean or base-case
curves) in nonlinear dynamic material properties, two sets of curves were used. The first set
was the original EPRI (1993) suite as shown on Figure 5.36. To consider the possibility that
the shallow materials may behave more linearly, a subset of the EPRI (1993) curves,
developed by modelling recorded motions at firm cohesionless soil sites (Silva et al. 1996),
was also used for each profile. The second set, termed Peninsular Range curves, uses the
EPRI (1993) 51- to 120-foot (15.5 to 36.6 m) curves for 0 to 50 feet (0 to 6.1 m) and the 501- to
1,000-foot (152.7 to 304.8 m) curves for deeper materials.

5.3.2     Development of Transfer Functions
Transfer functions include spectral ratios (5 percent damping) of horizontal site-specific
motions to hard-rock (reference site) motions (amplification factors), as well as
vertical-to-horizontal ratios (5 percent damping) computed for each profile for a suite of
expected (reference site) peak accelerations (0.01 to 1.50 g; Table 5.3). For each base-case
profile (P1, P2 and P3, Section 5.3.1.1.1), amplification factors relative to the reference site
were developed for surface motions corresponding to layer 1, as well as to layers 3 and 4 at
the surface. To develop site-specific hazard, for the repository and eight selected reference
horizon levels (listed in Table 5.5), in-layer (total motion) amplification factors were also
computed. Because the in-layer motions contain all the upgoing and downgoing wavefields at
depth (total motions), the horizon and repository amplification factors were also developed for
each base-case profile. Due to the proximity of Horizon 8 to Horizon 7 and considering
Horizon 8 is located in the same velocity material as Horizon 7, amplification factors were
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                             - 174 -                          March 2011
developed for Horizons 1 through 7, and the repository elevation at Horizon 8 would have very
similar amplification to that of Horizon 7.
To approximate nonlinear soil response, for horizontal motions, a random vibration
theory-based equivalent-linear approach was used (EPRI 1993, Silva et al. 1996). The
approach has been validated by modelling strong ground motions recorded at over 500 sites
and 19 earthquakes for a wide range in site conditions and loading levels (up to 1 g)
(EPRI 1993, Silva et al. 1996). Comparisons with fully nonlinear codes for loading levels up to
1 g showed that the equivalent-linear approach adequately captured both high- and
low-frequency soil response in terms of 5 percent damped response spectra. The validations
revealed that the equivalent-linear approach significantly underestimated durations (time
domain) of high-frequency motions at high loading levels compared to both fully nonlinear
analysis and recorded motions. However, for 5 percent damped response spectra, the
equivalent-linear approach performed as well as fully nonlinear codes and was somewhat
conservative near the fundamental column resonance (EPRI 1993). For vertical motions,
site-specific V/H ratios were developed using the point-source model to compute both
horizontal (normally incident, horizontally polarised shear [SH]) waves and vertical
(inclined-incident compression and vertically polarised shear [P-SV]) waves (Silva 1976,
Silva 1997, EPRI 1993).

   Figure 5.36: Generic G/Gmax and Hysteretic Damping Curves for Cohesionless Soils
In the implementation of Approach 3 to develop vertical hazard curves, empirical as well as
site-specific V/H ratios were used along with two sets of G/Gmax and hysteretic damping
curves. The resulting epistemic uncertainty was properly accommodated in the vertical mean
UHRS, reflecting a weighted average over multiple vertical hazard curves computed for each
model. The vertical UHRS then maintain the desired hazard levels, consistent with the
horizontal UHRS.

5.3.2.1    Site Aleatory Variability
To accommodate random fluctuations in velocity, depth to basement, G/Gmax and hysteretic
damping values across a site, multiple realisations (30) were developed for dynamic material
properties. The profile randomisation scheme for shear-wave velocity is based on an analysis
of variance of over 500 measured shear-wave velocity profiles and varies in both velocity and
layer thickness (EPRI 1993, Silva et al. 1996). The model includes a velocity distribution at
depth coupled with a velocity correlation with depth. The depth correlation is intended to
eliminate unnatural velocity variations at a given depth that are independent of realisations
above and below. The measured velocity data indicates an increase in correlation length
(distance) with depth, with a corresponding decrease in the velocity coefficient of variation at a
given depth. Profiles vary less as depth increases and, on average, become more uniform.
To accommodate random fluctuations in compression-wave velocity when modelling vertical
motions (Section 5.3.2.4), Poisson ratios were held constant at the base-case values and
random compression-wave velocities were then generated based on shear-wave velocity
realisations and base-case Poisson ratios. In reality, Poisson ratio will vary as well but is likely
correlated with shear-wave velocity. As a result, varying Poisson ratio when properly
correlated with shear-wave velocity will likely not result in a greater variation in
compression-wave velocity than assumed here. Additionally, variation in compression-wave
velocity has a much less significant effect on motions than does the shear-wave velocity, as
the wavelengths typically are two to five times greater. A correlated shear- and
compression-wave profile randomisation scheme is desirable but not yet available.
To capture random fluctuations in modulus reduction and hysteretic damping curves, values
were randomised assuming a lognormal distribution consistent with shear-wave velocity and
material damping (EPRI 1993). Based on random variations in laboratory dynamic testing for
soils of the same type or classification (EPRI 1993), a σln of 0.15 and 0.3 is used for G/Gmax
and hysteretic damping, respectively. These standard deviations are taken at a cyclic shear
strain of 0.03 percent, where the G/Gmax curves typically show significant reduction. Suites of
curves were generated by sampling the distribution, applying the random perturbation to the
base-case (initial) curve at 0.03 percent shear strain, and preserving the shape of the
base-case curve to generate an entire random curve. Bounds are placed at ±2 σ over the
entire strain range to prevent nonphysical excursions.
Shear-wave damping is separately (independently) randomised following the same procedure.
The randomisation code can accommodate coupling or correlation of any degree (-1 to 1)
between modulus reduction and hysteric damping, which is expected to occur between mean
or base-case curves reflecting curves of different types of material. However, for random
fluctuations within the same type of material, the correlation is likely to be low, that is, a
randomly linear curve is not necessarily associated with a randomly low damping. Additionally,
because modulus reduction is far more significant than material damping in site response
(Silva 1992), the issue is not significant.
5.3.2.2    Point-Source Model Parameters
The omega-square point-source model (Boore 1983, Atkinson 1993, Silva et al. 1996) was
used to generate the hard-rock reference site as well as site-specific motions (profiles P1, P2
and P3; Section 5.3.1.1) for a range in expected reference-site PGA values (0.01 to 1.50 g;
Table 5.3).
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                       - 177 -                               March 2011
To accommodate potential effects of control motion spectral shape (magnitude) on nonlinear
site response, amplification factors were computed for M 5.0, 6.0 and 7.0 based on the
magnitude deaggregations (Section 5.2.1). Additionally, because large M (M ≥ 5.5) CENA
source processes may be significantly different from those of WNA in spectral shape, typified
by an intermediate-frequency spectral sag or two corner frequencies (Atkinson 1993), transfer
functions were computed for this source model as well (Table 5.3). The hard-rock crustal
model used to generate vertical and horizontal component reference-site motions is listed on
Table 5.2, with the remaining point-source parameters (stress drop, Δσ; Q; and kappa) listed
on Table 5.3.
To include the effects of the change in magnitude contributions to the reference site hazard
with both structural and exceedance frequency, indicated in the magnitude deaggregations
(Section 5.2.1), weights were assigned to the respective amplification factors according to
Table 5.4. The weighting over magnitude accommodates potential effects of control motion
spectral shape, due to magnitude, on the nonlinear response of the shallow soil and rock
layers on the amplification factors. Because the amplification factors vary slowly with
magnitude, with a maximum change of about 30 percent for a unit change in M
(McGuire et al. 2001), only an approximate accommodation of the change in amplification due
to a change in magnitude with hard-rock hazard level is required.
5.3.2.3    Horizontal Amplification Factors
As an example of the horizontal amplification factors, Figure 5.38 shows median and ±1 σ
estimates computed at the surface of Profile 1 (Section 5.3.1.1.1) with M 6.0 control motions
(single-corner source model; Table 5.3) using the EPRI (1993) G/Gmax and hysteretic damping
curves (Section 5.3.1.2). Peak ground accelerations reflect expected hard-rock (reference
site; Table 5.2) values ranging from 0.01 g to 1.50 g (Table 5.3). The amplification of the
shallow, stiff profile (Figure 5.35 and Table 5.2) is apparent in the high-frequency amplification
(≥3 Hz), with values at peak acceleration (100 Hz) of about 2. Figure 5.38 clearly shows the
effects of nonlinearity, with high-frequency factors decreasing with increasing loading levels.
For example, at 1.5 g and 40 Hz, the median factors decrease to about 1. Such a large
deamplification may represent a shortcoming of the equivalent-linear approach that reflects a
frequency-independent softening. However, careful validations with recorded motions at high
loading levels (EPRI 1993, Silva et al. 1996) showed no indication of equivalent-linear
inadequacy in modelling overall levels of response spectra of recorded motions, particularly at
high frequency. While these local particular soils were not sampled in the validations, the
overall adequacy of the equivalent-linear approach has been validated for deamplification to
levels as low as 0.5, which was set as a lower bound in all analyses.
Figure 5.39 shows the amplification factors computed for the repository location at a depth of
680 m (Figure 5.37). These motions were computed as total or in-layer motions which then
include all upgoing and downgoing wavefields at the repository elevation. Relative to
hard-rock outcropping, the in-layer motions show deamplification at frequencies above about
0.2 Hz due to some cancellation of upgoing and downgoing wavefields. Due to the
randomisation process, these spectral holes or nulls (Silva et al. 1986) are smoothed over
frequency.

5.3.2.4     Development of V/H Ratios
In the following sections, the development of site-specific ratios and the motivation for inclusion
of empirical V/H ratios is presented.
Empirical V/H Ratios
Empirical V/H ratios for soft rock in WNA were included in the development of vertical surface
motions in addition to site-specific point-source simulations. The use of WNA empirical
V/H ratios implicitly assumes similarity in shear- and compression-wave profiles and nonlinear
dynamic material properties between site conditions in WNA and the Bruce nuclear site.
Whereas this may not be the case for the average WNA rock site profile (Silva 1996), the
range in site conditions sampled by the WNA empirical generic rock relations likely
accommodates site-specific conditions, at least for the shallow, stiff soil/soft rock (profile P1)
and firm rock materials (profile P2) (Section 5.3.1.1.1). For profile P1, equal weight was given
to the vertical hazard developed with the empirical V/H ratios and the hazard developed with
the site-specific V/H ratios. The firm-rock outcropping profile (P2), with a shallow stiffness of
1,860 m/sec (Table 5.2) and only 18 m overlying hard rock, was considered to be less well
represented within the WNA empirical GMPEs and was given a reduced weight of 0.2, with the
remaining 0.8 given to the site-specific vertical hazard.
The WNA soft-rock empirical GMPEs that specify both horizontal and vertical motions are
those of Abrahamson and Silva (1997), Campbell and Bozorgnia (2003) and Sadigh et al.
(1993), and all three were used with equal relative weights (Table 5.7) to develop vertical V/H
ratios. As an example, the entire suite of empirical V/H ratios in terms of magnitudes and
distances is shown on Figure 5.40 for all three GMPEs. As Figure 5.40 illustrates, V/H ratios
depend on both magnitude and distance, generally increasing with increasing magnitude and
decreasing distance (Silva 1997, Campbell and Bozorgnia 2003).
Site-Specific V/H Ratios
To develop site-specific vertical motions, inclined-incident P-SV waves were modelled from the
source to the site using the plane-wave propagators of Silva (1976) and EPRI (1993),
assuming a shear-wave point-source spectrum (Boore 1983, 2003). The point-source model
was used to accommodate the effects of source distance and source depth on V/H ratios. For
consistency, both the horizontal and vertical motions were modelled using the same source
and path parameters and suite of distances (Table 5.3). The horizontal motions were
modelled as vertically propagating shear waves. For the vertical motions, the angles of
incidence were computed by two-point ray tracing through the crust and site-specific profile.
To model site response, the near-surface VP and VS profiles (Section 5.3.1.1; Figure 5.34)
were merged with reference-site crustal structure (Table 5.2), the incident P-SV wavefield was
propagated to the surface assuming a linear analysis, and the vertical motions were computed.

In the implementation of the equivalent-linear approach to estimate V/H response spectral
ratios, the horizontal component analyses are performed for vertically propagating shear
waves. To compute the vertical motions, a linear analysis is performed for inclined-incident
P-SV waves using low-strain VP and VS derived from the base-case profiles. The P-wave
damping is assumed to be equal to the low-strain S-wave damping (Johnson and Silva 1981,
EPRI 1993), and the horizontal-component and vertical-component analyses are assumed to
be independent.

                Figure 5.38: Example of Horizontal Amplification at the Surface
The approximations of linear analysis for the vertical component and uncoupled vertical and
horizontal components have been validated in two ways. Fully nonlinear modelling using a 3-D
soil model shows that the assumption of largely independent horizontal and vertical motions for
loading levels up to about 0.5 g (soil surface, horizontal component) for moderately stiff profiles is
appropriate (EPRI 1993). Additionally, validation exercises with recorded motions have been
conducted at over 50 sites that recorded the 1989 M 6.9 Loma Prieta and 1992 M 6.7 Northridge
earthquakes (EPRI 1993). These validations show that the overall bias and variability is
acceptably low for engineering applications but is larger than that for horizontal motions. The
vertical model does not perform as well as the model for horizontal motions (EPRI 1993, Silva
1997). An indirect validation was also performed by comparing V/H ratios from WNA empirical
GMPEs with model predictions over a wide range in loading conditions (Silva 1997). The results
showed a favourable comparison, with the model exceeding the empirical V/H ratios at high
frequency, particularly at high loading levels. In the V/H comparisons with empirical relations, the
model also shows a small underprediction at low frequency (≤1 Hz) and at large distance (≥20 km).
For the vertical analyses, a hard-rock kappa value of 0.003 sec, half that of the horizontal, was
used. This factor of 50 percent is based on observations of kappa at strong-motion sites
(Anderson and Hough 1984), validation exercises (EPRI 1993), and the observation that the
peak in the vertical spectral acceleration (5 percent damped) for WNA rock and soil sites is
generally near 10 to 12 Hz, compared to the horizontal motion peak that occurs at about 5 Hz,
conditional on M 6.5 at a distance of about 10 to 30 km (Abrahamson and Silva 1997,
Campbell 1997, Campbell and Bozorgnia 2003). This difference of about 2 in peak frequency
is directly attributable to differences in kappa of about 2. Similar trends are seen in CEUS

hard-rock spectra with the vertical component peaking at higher frequencies than the
horizontal component.

km/sec. Figure is from EPRI (1993, 2004): M 6.0, single-corner source model, profile 1 (Section 5.3.1.1.1), and
EPRI (1993) G/Gmax and hysteretic damping curves.

                                          within layer or total motion)
In computing the vertical motions, multiple G/Gmax and hysteretic damping curves were not run
for the verticals as the analysis was linear, using the lowest small-strain damping between the
Peninsular Range and EPRI (1993) curves (Section 5.3.1.2). However V/H ratios do reflect
multiple base-case modulus reduction and hysteretic damping curves in the denominator, or
horizontal motions. As such, the epistemic variability (uncertainty) in V/H ratios due to the
uncertainty in nonlinear dynamic material properties in the horizontal analyses was
accommodated through two sets of V/H ratios reflecting EPRI (1993) and Peninsular Range
(Silva et al. 1996) G/Gmax and hysteretic damping curves. Additionally, differences in
horizontal site response due to differences in source processes (spectral shape) between
single- and double-corner source models (as control motions) also reflect epistemic variability
and are accommodated with V/H ratios computed using both source models.
As an example of the site-specific V/H ratios, Figure 5.41 shows median estimates of the
complete suite of site-specific V/H ratios developed for profile 1 (Section 5.3.1.1) at the surface
and the repository (680 m; Figure 5.37 and Table 5.5) using the EPRI (1993) G/Gmax and
hysteretic damping curves. The magnitudes and distances were selected to accommodate the

                               for Profiles 1 and 2 (Section 5.3.1.1)
As previously discussed, the model predictions of V/H ratios at low frequency may be slightly
unconservative and at high frequency they may be conservative. Additionally, empirical
V/H ratios of Fourier amplitude spectra based on CENA recordings at hard-rock sites for small
magnitudes and at very large distances have median values near about 0.8 and vary slowly
with frequency (Gupta and McLaughlin 1987, Atkinson 1993). To accommodate potential
model deficiencies as well as the large uncertainty in hard- and firm-rock V/H ratios for CENA,
a minimum value of 0.7 was adopted, the average of the empirical CENA and site-specific
V/H ratios at large distance (>20 km).

                                     Used in the Development of the Vertical Hazard
Aleatory Variability in the Site-Specific V/H Ratios
In addition to the epistemic variability accommodated through the use of multiple models for
V/H ratios (two sets of G/Gmax and hysteretic damping curves, single- and double-corner
source models, and empirical versus site-specific V/H ratios), aleatory variability due to
randomness of dynamic material properties varying vertically and laterally across the site
should be accommodated as well. However, in developing the vertical hazard, since site-
specific aleatory variability has been incorporated in developing the horizontal site-specific
hazard curves, it is advisable to constrain the sigma of the site-specific V/H ratios to values
less than about 0.15 to 0.20 (σln). This range is to accommodate the observation of slightly
larger variability about median attenuation relations in the vertical component compared to the
horizontal component (Abrahamson and Silva 1997).
Implementation of V/H Ratios In Developing Vertical Hazard
Based on the changes in contributing sources across exceedance and structural frequency,
the dependencies of the V/H ratios on magnitude and distance were accommodated with
relative weights based on the deaggregations (Section 5.2.1). Because the empirical and site-
specific V/H ratios change slowly with magnitude and distance (Figure 5.40 and Figure 5.41),
only a smooth approximation to the hazard deaggregation is necessary. To adequately
capture the change in magnitude and distance with AEF, only a few magnitudes and distances
were required and reflected in the weights listed in Table 5.6.

As discussed previously, epistemic variability in nonlinear dynamic material properties for the
horizontal motions was addressed by computing V/H ratios for both EPRI (1993) as well as
Peninsular Range (Silva et al. 1996) G/Gmax and hysteretic damping curves. In addition,
V/H ratios were computed for both single- and double-corner source models as well as both
empirical and site-specific V/H ratios. Equal weights were applied to the vertical hazard
computed using the EPRI (1993) and Peninsular Range curves as well as single- versus
double-corner source models. For profiles 1 and 2 (Section 5.3.1.1.1), which included the
shallow stiff soil/soft rock and firm rock materials, equal weight was given to the empirical rock
and site-specific V/H ratios. For profile 3, with those softer near-surface layers removed, the
site-specific V/H ratios were given a weight of 0.8, with 0.2 for the empirical WNA soft-rock
V/H ratios. The relative weights are listed in Table 5.7.
It is important to note that the weights regarding V/H ratios were not applied to the ratios
themselves. This approach would neglect the epistemic variability due to uncertainty in the
correct mean V/H ratios. Rather, for each case, full vertical hazard curves were developed
and weights applied over exceedance frequency to develop appropriate estimates of mean
vertical hazard with AEF consistent with that of the horizontal.

5.3.3      Site-Specific Horizontal and Vertical UHRS
5.3.3.1     Within Repository UHRS
Site-specific horizontal and vertical URHS were developed at the repository horizon and at the
elevations of Horizons 1 through 7 (Table 5.5). At each location three horizontal and vertical
UHRS were developed corresponding to profiles P1, P2 and P3 (Section 5.3.1.1.1) and AEF
values of 4x10-4, 10–5, and 10–6. As discussed above in Section 5.3.1.1.1, the intent of the
three profiles was to capture the potential effects of lateral variability in site surface conditions
on the site-specific ground motions. Figure 5.42 and Figure 5.43 show the resulting 10–5 AEF
UHRS for the repository elevation and Horizon 1 elevation, respectively. As indicated on the
figures, the differences in the surface conditions (Profiles P1, P2 and P3) have minimal effect
on the ground motions at depth within the elevation range of interest to repository design.
Therefore, a single UHRS is developed for each AEF and repository elevation by enveloping
the results obtained for the three profiles. These UHRS are then smoothed to remove dips in
the spectra caused by wavefield cancellations in the idealised one-dimensional site profile, as
shown on Figure 5.42 and Figure 5.43. The smoothed envelope UHRS are shown on Figure
5.44 through Figure 5.49 and are listed in Table 5.8, Table 5.9, and Table 5.10.
5.3.4      Development of Design Time Histories
Three component spectrally matched design time histories were developed for UHRS at AEF
10–5 and 10–6 for selected elevations within the repository and shaft system. The matching
criteria followed those specified in the U.S. NRC Regulatory Guide 1.208 (USNRC 2007). To
maintain hazard levels defined by the UHRS at high frequency, the matching criteria were
extended from 0.2 – 25.0 Hz to 0.2 – 50.0 Hz.
Design time histories were developed for the repository horizon as well as the reference
horizon levels. Due to the similarity in the UHRS at several horizon elevations (see Figure
 Seismic Hazard Assessment                       - 190 -                                 March 2011
5.46 through Figure 5.49), the seven UHRS were combined into four distinct UHRS: Horizon 1,
envelope of Horizons 2 and 3, envelope of Horizons 4 and 5, and envelope of Horizons 6 and
7. Including the repository horizon, there are a total of five distinct sets of three-component
spectrally matched time histories corresponding to AEF 10–5 and 10–6.
The spectral matching approach adjusts the Fourier amplitude spectrum of an input (basis)
time history such that its response spectrum matches that of a target (Silva and Lee 1987).
The resulting time history has its phase spectrum largely unaltered, preserving the
nonstationarity of the basis time history as well as relative phasing between components, both
of which may be important for structural analyses.
5.3.4.1    Surface UHRS
Site-specific horizontal and vertical UHRS were developed for the surface for an AEF of 4×10–4
(return period of 2,500 years). These spectra are shown on Figure 5.50 and Figure 5.51 and
are listed in Table 5.12. These spectra represent surface motions for three site conditions.
The results for profile P1 represent surface motions on top of the Pleistocene soils. The
results for profile P2 represent surface motions at the top of the firm rock with the Pleistocene
soils removed (average depth below present grade of 15 m). The results for profile P3
represent surface motions at the top of the hard sedimentary rock at an average depth below
the present grade of 33 m. These three conditions are provided to allow evaluation of the
surface facilities using a range of possible site conditions. The results for profile P1 are
considerably higher than for profiles P2 and P3, reflecting the amplification effects of the
lower-velocity Pleistocene sediments.
5.3.4.2    Target Spectra
The magnitude-distance deaggregations of the 10–6 AEF hazard shown on Figure 5.10c,
Figure 5.11c and Figure 5.12c indicate that the earthquakes that provide a majority of the
hazard are different at high and low frequencies. Thus it would be unrealistic to expect a
single earthquake recording to represent the entire UHRS. Instead, scenario earthquake
spectra were developed to represent the earthquakes that are the dominate contributors to the
hazard at various spectral frequency ranges. The selected scenarios are listed below.
The GMPEs selected for the PSHA (Section 4) were used to compute spectra for the scenario
earthquakes. The scenario spectra were developed as the average of the motions predicted
by the models of Atkinson and Boore (2006), Campbell (2003) and Silva et al. (2003). The
model developed by Atkinson (2008) was not used because of the limited number of spectral
frequencies provided. The number of standard deviations above the median motions for each
scenario was selected such that the resulting spectrum provided a close match to the UHRS
over the spectral frequency range of interest. Figure 5.52 and Figure 5.53 show the resulting
scenario spectra compared to the UHRS for AEF values of 10–5 and 10–6, respectively. The
reference rock scenario spectra were then scaled by the transfer functions developed in
Section 5.3.2 to produce target spectra for each repository elevation.

5.3.4.3   Basis Time Histories
The basis time histories selected for the spectral matching to the three deterministic spectra
include the 1994 Northridge earthquake, an M 5.3 aftershock as well as the M 6.7 main shock.
For the largest deterministic magnitude, a rock site recording of the 1999 M 7.6 earthquake in
Chi-Chi, Taiwan, was selected. Table 5.13 summarizes the basis earthquakes, site conditions,
and distances.

The cross-correlations of the acceleration time histories are listed in Table 5.14. All are less
than the minimum of 0.16 specified in Regulatory Guide 1.208 (U.S. NRC 2007).
Figure 5.54, Figure 5.55 and Figure 5.56 show how the response spectra for the three
scenario time histories in aggregate provide a good match to the repository 10–5 AEF UHRS
over the entire frequency range. Use of the three scenario time histories captures the ground
motion levels corresponding to the target AEF with realistic motions that may be experienced
in individual earthquakes. Figure 5.57, Figure 5.58, and Figure 5.59 show similar results for
the 10-6 AEF time histories.

6.        CONCLUSIONS
This report develops design ground motions for the proposed Deep Geologic Repository
(DGR) at the Bruce nuclear site in Ontario, Canada. The site is located in the stable
continental region of eastern North America in a region of low, diffuse seismicity. Examination
of the earthquake catalogue developed for the region indicates that only five earthquakes with
estimated moment magnitudes greater than M 2 have occurred within 100 km of the site. The
catalogue contains only 43 earthquakes with magnitudes greater than M 2 within 200 km of the
site, the largest of these was the 1959/8/4 earthquake with an estimated moment magnitude of
M 3.9 located 184 km from the site. Areas of higher seismicity in the region are located near
the western end of Lake Ontario, approximately 175 km southeast of the site and in western
Quebec, approximately 375 km northeast of the site.
The design ground motions for the DGR were developed in a two-stage process. The first
stage involved performing a probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA) for the site for a
reference site condition. The second stage involved translating the results of the PSHA to
ground motions at appropriate horizons within the geologic profile at the Bruce nuclear site.
The PSHA was conducted for surface motions on a reference hard rock site condition that is
representative of eastern North America. The main components of the PSHA are seismic
source characterization and ground motion characterization. Seismic source characterization
provides a probabilistic model for the rate of occurrence, spatial distribution, and size
distribution of earthquakes within the region surrounding the site. Two types of seismic
sources were included in the model. The primary sources are regional source zones used to
model the occurrence of distributed seismicity throughout the region. In addition, specific
geologic/geophysical features that have been proposed as possible active sources in the
scientific literature were included as local seismic sources that may concentrate seismicity.
These are located primarily in the vicinity of the western end of Lake Ontario. Ground motion
characterization provides a probabilistic model for the level of ground shaking that earthquakes
in the region may produce at the Bruce nuclear site. The PSHA conducted for the DGR
explicitly incorporated uncertainties in the probabilistic models and model parameters that
affect seismic hazard at the site. In particular, the probability that the local sources are indeed
active was included in the PSHA model.
The results of the PSHA provided uniform hazard response spectra (UHRS) for annual
exceedance frequencies (AEF) in the range of 10-2 to 10-8 (return periods of 100 to 108 years).
The regional source zones were found to be the dominant contributors to the hazard. The
contribution of individual assessments to the uncertainty for various components in the seismic
hazard computation was also examined. The results indicated that selection of the appropriate
ground motion models is the largest contributor to the uncertainty in seismic hazard. Other
significant sources of uncertainty are the regional seismotectonic source spatial distribution
models, the maximum magnitude assessments, and the estimation of the b-value of the
Gutenberg-Richter magnitude-frequency relationships. The results of the PSHA are generally
consistent with values published in the 2005 National Building Code of Canada when corrected
to a common site condition and accounting for the differences in the selected ground motion
models used in the two studies.
The results of the PSHA indicate that the estimated ground motions at the surface on hard
rock are expected to be less than 1.0g for annual exceedance frequencies of 10-5, the
reference case, and 10-6, the extreme case. The following table summarizes the results of the
PSHA.

        Notes: * AEF used in 2005 NBCC
These relatively low levels of seismic hazard are consistent with the low level of seismicity in
the site region. The estimated cumulative annual occurrence frequency for a M 5 or larger
earthquake within 100 km of the Bruce nuclear site is 3x10-4, and for a M 6 or larger
earthquake within 200 km of the site the value is 1x10-4.
The second stage of the process for development of design ground motions involved
translating the reference hard rock PSHA results to appropriate horizons within the proposed
repository system in a manner that preserves the probabilistic levels assigned to each UHRS.
A probabilistic model for site response was developed utilizing measured dynamic properties
of the site geologic units. This model was then used to develop UHRS at the repository level
(depth 680 m) and at seven selected reference horizon levels between the surface and the
repository. In addition UHRS were developed for the ground surface for three representative
site conditions which reflect differences in the amount of surficial material that may be
removed. These UHRS are provided for both horizontal and vertical motions. The resulting
levels of ground motion are similar to those developed for the hard rock surface reflecting the
generally high stiffness of the in-situ rock layers.
The final task was to develop design time histories for the repository and selected horizon
levels. In order to represent the hazard with realistic earthquake motions, three scenario
earthquakes were developed to represent the range of earthquakes contributing to the site
hazard. Acceleration time histories were then spectrally matched to response spectra for
these scenario earthquakes. The envelope of the response spectra for the three scenario
earthquake time histories provides a good match to the repository and horizon UHRS.

Earthquake information seen Aug. 8 2016 at http://earthquaketrack.com/ The Endangered Species Act 2007 applies to any activity that poses an immediate threat to threatened
or endangered species and their habitats. Projects cannot be “grandfathered” to avoid it and the most
current version of the law stands.
The Endangered Species Act demands that there must be a net benefit for the species. If one is killed,
they must be replaced by two or more live specimens per kill and they must expand on the delineated
protected habitat area to assure the improved survival rates of the remaining specimens in the area. A
single application can take up to 7 years before a permit is issued. It must be signed three times by
various review agencies including MNR staff, the deputy minister, the MNR ministers and others.
Prior to the issuance of permit the request be posted on the Environmental Bill of Rights Registry for
public comment. ALL alternative designs submitted by city planners, developers and the public can be
reviewed at this phase and the decision that best balances needs of the threatened/endangered species
and planning needs can be implemented. If there is no reasonable way to secure a net benefit of the
species, the request will be denied

Executive Summary
Canada’s oil production in 2012 was higher than it has ever been before, and is projected to continue
growing in coming years. Production from Canada’s oil sands is forecast to continue growing from 1.8
million barrels per day to more than 5 million barrels per day in 2035. New gas discoveries, particularly
from shale, are also rising, further driving forecasts of growing natural gas production. Moving this oil
and gas to markets requires infrastructure in the form of pipelines, rail or marine tankers. In Canada,
the vast majority of oil, and all natural gas, is moved to market in pipelines. Federally regulated
pipelines transport more than $100 billion worth of oil, gas, and petroleum products each year.
With several major pipelines being proposed or developed in recent years and in light of a number of
high-profile incidents across North America recently, the safety and security of Canada’s pipelines is
under intense scrutiny. With this in mind, the federal, provincial and territorial governments undertook
a detailed review of the safety regimes governing pipelines across Canada. The analysis involved a
survey of jurisdictions with pipeline systems.
This report consolidates the input received from across the country to provide a comprehensive
perspective on Canada’s overall pipeline regulatory regime. The approach to pipeline safety in Canada
can be divided among three pillars: (1) prevention; (2) preparedness and response; and (3) liability and
compensation. There are many similarities in the regulatory approach undertaken by different
jurisdictions under each of these pillars.
Prevention
Both Federal and Provincial pipeline regulators require pipeline operators to anticipate, prevent,
manage and mitigate potentially dangerous conditions associated with pipelines under their
jurisdiction. Companies must design safety management, environmental protection, emergency
management, security management, third party crossings, public awareness and integrity programs,
which are reviewed and audited by regulators. Pipeline management is always improving with regular
updates to standards and regulations that require operators to systematically inspect and evaluate
pipe condition and proactively ensure safe operation.
Preparedness and Response
Federal and provincial pipeline regulatory oversight is aimed at preventing incidents from happening.
However, if an incident occurs, regulators exercise their authority to protect the public, workers,
property, and the environment. A company’s emergency management program guides response and
containment of a spill with appropriate equipment and personnel. Pipeline companies must have
internal or contracted spill first-responders, and continually educate them on practices and procedures
to be followed in the event of an emergency.
Industry also has voluntary arrangements in place to collaborate on emergency preparedness and
response. For example, through oil spill co-operatives, companies within a specific geographic region
work together to achieve a state of spill response readiness. Additionally, member companies of the
Canadian Energy Pipeline Association (CEPA) recently formalized an agreement to collaborate on
emergency response, which allows for the sharing of resources, personnel, equipment and advice, in
the event of an emergency.

                                          Safety and Security of Energy Pipelines in Canada: A Report to Ministers
Liability and Compensation
Provincial liability regimes apply to both federally and provincially regulated pipelines as long as they
do not violate the inter-jurisdictional immunity and paramountcy. The provinces and territories have
used two general approaches, often simultaneously, to create statutory civil liability regimes. Some
provinces, as well as the Yukon Territory, have enacted legislation governing the operation of
intraprovincial pipelines; in many cases, such legislation imposes some degree of liability on pipeline
operators for government spill response costs. Second, every province and territory has enacted
legislation governing the release of environmental pollutants. These laws typically establish a cost
recovery mechanism that governments may use to hold pipeline operators liable for spill response
costs. In some cases, pipeline operators are also subject to codified liability where a spill causes
government and/or third party loss or damage.
Next Steps
Continuous improvement is an absolute requirement for achieving and maintaining a world-class
energy pipeline regulatory regime in Canada. Building on recent and ongoing pipeline regulatory
improvements across federal, provincial and territorial jurisdictions, areas of focus moving forward
include:
-   Continue implementing proposed legislative, regulatory, and related pipeline initiatives while
    ensuring that Aboriginals and other key stakeholders are meaningfully engaged;
-   Commit to further studying and improving the safety and security of broader energy transportation
    systems including rail, marine and trucking;
-   Enhance communications to ensure fact-based dialogue surrounding energy transportation;
-   Explore options for improved cooperation and collaboration between jurisdictions either through
    harmonization, sharing or leveraging information and expertise;
-   Explore opportunities for enhanced collaboration on pipeline innovation between governments,
    regulators and industry – for example, “Best Available Technologies” recognized through the
    Canadian Pipeline Technology Collaborative (CPTC);
-   Continue to cooperate in efforts to enhance the safety and security of hydrocarbon production and
    transportation systems, including damage prevention and cyber security.

Context and Methodology
With 825 000 kilometres of transmission, gathering and distribution pipelines in Canada, most
provinces have significant pipeline infrastructure. This includes 105 000 kilometres of large-diameter
transmission pipelines. Oil and natural gas pipelines are generally buried underground and service most
major Canadian cities. The National Energy Board (NEB) regulates about 100 companies which operate
over 73 000 kilometres of pipelines in Canada.
Pipelines are necessary to deliver fuel to Canadians to heat their homes, drive their cars, or travel by
bus, ship, train, or air. The majority of homes in Canada are heated with natural gas, all of which is
delivered by pipeline. Petroleum products are also used as feedstock to make materials found in
everyday household items, such as toiletries, electronics and clothes. Pipelines are used to move these
petroleum products to refineries and to customers across the country. Canadians simply could not live
as they do today without pipelines.
Before any pipeline project can proceed, it must be reviewed by the appropriate federal or provincial
regulator to ensure that it is designed, constructed and operated in a manner that is safe and secure,
protects the environment and the public, and is economically feasible and in the public interest.
Pipelines are regulated throughout their entire life cycle (planning, design, construction, operation,
decommissioning and abandonment). An integral part of this process is the engagement of
stakeholders. This two-way communication keeps stakeholders informed about projects and keeps the
pipeline operator and government aware of community issues and concerns while informing
appropriate mitigation to minimize impacts
Canada has the resources to become a global supplier of oil and natural gas, but requires additional
infrastructure to access new or expanding markets. Markets are responding, by driving the pursuit of
various transportation options, including pipelines, marine, and rail. In light of this expanding energy
transportation infrastructure, when taken in conjunction with several recent high-profile incidents,
there is increasing scrutiny on the part of Canadians regarding the safety of Canada’s energy
infrastructure and transportation systems.
Within this context, federal, provincial and territorial officials sought to catalogue existing safety and
security measures and regimes covering pipelines across Canada, to take stock and assess the scope of
these activities.
A survey (ref. Annex 1) was circulated to federal, provincial and territorial officials through the Energy
and Mines Ministers’ Conference Markets and Trade Working Group. Annex 2 provides the
jurisdictions’ responses. The survey collected information on specific elements related to pipelines,
organized under three pillars: 1) Prevention; 2) Preparedness & Response1; and, 3) Liability &
Compensation.
Each jurisdiction was invited to use the survey as a means to frame their particular pipeline safety
regime. This report consolidates the input received from the provinces so as to provide an overview of
pipeline regulatory regimes across Canada. The report is not intended to provide comparisons between
jurisdictions or to serve as a gap analysis tool; instead, it is a simple compendium of pipeline regulatory

  In some provinces, such as British Columbia, provincial environment ministries have legislated responsibilities for spills of
hazardous materials. Provincial environment ministries were not specifically surveyed in this exercise.

regimes across Canada. This is an important point as the jurisdictions being compared differ
substantially in the amount of pipelines and types of products that flow through them, making
comparisons difficult.
Introduction
Canadian pipeline regulators provide safety-focused oversight and emergency management for energy
pipeline facilities and operations. The National Energy Board (NEB) is the independent federal agency
established to regulate international and inter-provincial pipelines, energy development and trade.
Pipelines contained entirely within a single jurisdiction are generally regulated by provincial or
territorial regulatory bodies. Annex 3 provides a list of pipeline regulators in Canada.
Pipeline regulatory regimes across Canada have much in common, including the adoption of the
Canadian Standards Association (CSA) standard Z662 – Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems, which sets out the
technical standards for the design, construction, operation, maintenance and decommissioning of
Canada’s oil and gas pipelines. However, there are still significant differences in regulatory regimes
across Canada. This report uses survey data to compare and contrast pipeline regulatory regimes
across Canada, focusing on three particular areas.
Prevention
Regulatory oversight is aimed at preventing incidents from happening. Pipeline regulators require
companies to anticipate, prevent, manage and mitigate potentially dangerous conditions associated
with their pipelines. Companies must design safety management, environmental protection,
emergency management, security management, third party crossings, public awareness and integrity
programs, which are reviewed and audited by regulatory bodies. Regulators have various enforcement
measures at their disposal to ensure compliance.
Preparedness & Response
In the event of a spill, pipeline regulators must be notified immediately. A company’s Emergency
Procedures Manual guides the response and containment of a spill. Pipeline companies must have
internal or contracted spill first-responders and continually educate all first responders – including
external agencies such as fire departments and police – on practices and procedures to be followed in
the event of an emergency.
Liability & Compensation
If the operator is at fault, the pipeline company is liable for costs to clean up a pipeline spill. Regulators
can order remediation. The Government of Canada intends to enshrine in legislation the ‘polluter pays’
principle and require pipeline companies to have sufficient financial capacity to respond to spills, leaks
and ruptures while ensuring companies remain responsible for their abandoned pipelines. In addition
to being financially responsible for clean-up, the company may also be fined or be subjected to other
enforcement actions such as Notices of Non-Compliance, Orders, Administrative Monetary Penalties,
revocation of authorization or prosecution. Violators may also be subject to prosecution and fines
under other federal and provincial legislation.

               Canada’s World-Class Pipeline Safety
The Government of Canada is taking action to improve Canada’s pipeline safety system on federally
regulated pipelines through the strongest measures in three areas — 1) Prevention; 2) Preparedness
& Response; and 3) Liability & Compensation. Examples of recent changes, initiatives and proposed
amendments include:
   Prevention
          Increase the number of annual oil and gas pipeline inspections conducted by the
           National Energy Board (NEB) by 50 percent
          Double the number of annual comprehensive audits by the NEB (from three to six)
          Improve disclosure of publicly available pipeline safety documents
          The government will seek guidance from NEB on the application of “best available
           technology” in pipeline construction and operations
          Apply Administrative Monetary Penalties for violations of the NEB Act
          Strengthen and clarify the powers of NEB audit and inspection officers
   Preparedness & Response
          Require pipeline companies to have minimum financial resources to be prepared for an
           incident (set at $1B for major oil pipelines)
          Require companies to have a minimum amount of cash on hand to respond quickly to
           incidents
          Enable the NEB with the ability to take control of response and clean-up
          Provide the NEB authority and resources to take control of incident response if a
           company is unable or unwilling to do so
          Develop a strategy for integrating Aboriginal communities in pipeline safety operations,
           e.g., emergency response planning, pipeline monitoring, and related employment and
           business opportunities
   Liability & Compensation
          Make companies operating pipelines liable on a “no-fault” basis for up to $1 billion, in
           addition to unlimited liability when at fault or negligent
          Hold pipeline companies responsible for pipelines for entire life cycle, including post
           abandonment
          Provide government funds for clean-up if a company is unable or unwilling
           (incapacitated) and recover costs from industry
          Provide the NEB with authority to order companies operating pipelines to reimburse
           any cleanup costs incurred by governments or individuals
          Improve pipeline arbitration for compensation disputes

Survey Results and Analysis
I) Prevention
Both Federal and Provincial pipeline regulators require pipeline operators to anticipate, prevent,
manage and mitigate potentially dangerous conditions associated with pipelines under their
jurisdiction. Companies must design safety management, environmental protection, emergency
management, third party crossings, public awareness and integrity programs, which are reviewed and
audited by regulators. Pipeline management is always improving, with regular updates to standards
and regulations that require operators to systematically inspect and evaluate pipe condition and
proactively ensure safe operation.
Safety Culture and Standards
Safety culture is an assembly of characteristics and attitudes that ensure an overriding priority for
safety issues. Safety culture is implemented by organizations and reinforced and mandated through
the adoption of codes, standards and
regulations.
                                                                          GOVERNMENT OF CANADA
The Canadian Standards Association (CSA)                           CanmetMATERIALS Pipelines Program
provides the benchmark standards and
regulations for all pipelines in Canada. The CSA         CanmetMATERIALS is a materials research laboratory in
Standard Z662 — Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems             Natural Resources Canada. Its Pipelines Program
                                                         develops and validates new materials and technologies
sets out the technical standards for the design,
                                                         to:
construction, operation, maintenance and
decommissioning of Canada’s oil and gas                        extend the life of oil and gas pipelines;
pipelines. Standards are continually reviewed                  increase pipeline capacity;
using strict revision and approval protocols by a              ensure pipeline integrity and reliability;
knowledgeable and experienced group of                         provide authoritative information on pipeline
professionals representing industry                             materials issues;
stakeholders, including provincial and federal                 improve or enable development of new
pipeline regulators. CSA Z662 is revised and                    codes and standards; and,
published on a four-year basis.                                facilitate innovation and competitiveness.
Regulations and legislation govern pipeline
activities within Canadian jurisdictions. Examples include New Brunswick’s Pipeline Act 2005 and
Manitoba’s Oil and Gas Act. All provincial and federal regulatory bodies adopt the latest version of CSA
Standard Z662 into their own regulatory frameworks through “incorporation by reference”. Some
provinces adapt CSA Z662 to reflect unique circumstances in their jurisdiction.
Other examples of recognized standards organizations that can be incorporated by reference include:
the American Petroleum Institute (API), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the
American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), Underwriters Laboratories of Canada (ULC) and the
National Research Council Canada (NRCC).

                                                INDUSTRY-LED INITIATIVE
                                       Canadian Pipeline Technology Collaborative
     The recently established Canadian Pipeline Technology Collaborative (CPTC), led by industry, will address
     key challenges in technology development for the pipeline industry. The key objectives of the CPTC
     include: to develop, implement and commercialize new pipeline technologies; champion the expansion
     of research infrastructure in government, academic and private research facilities across Canada to meet
     the needs of industry-driven projects; and support a network for pipeline research in Canada and around
     the world to focus collaboration on priority issues.
     Supply chain partners, especially small and medium enterprises, will be engaged to validate new
     technologies as well as to develop new technologies to fill technology gaps identified through the project
     work. Priority topics, identified by industry, include:
           Integrity Management: Reduce the number of pipeline leaks through effective design,
            construction, inspection and maintenance;
           Leak Detection: Improve the sensitivity and reliability of leak detection systems; and,
           Spill Response: Mitigate the environmental impact of spills through faster response and
            effective restoration techniques.
While most jurisdictions use CSA Z662 as the minimum performance standard for pipelines, some
provinces impose additional requirements. For example, CSA Z662 contains non-mandatory provisions
in its annexes such as “Guidelines for pipeline system integrity management programs”. Alberta and
British Columbia make these guidelines mandatory and enforce them through provincial regulatory
frameworks. The Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) and the British Columbia Oil and Gas Commission
(BCOGC) require pipeline operators to develop, implement, and document, for all of its pipelines, a
pipeline integrity management program that complies with the latest edition of CSA Z662, Annex N.
Similarly, Alberta and Saskatchewan require that the recommended leak detection requirements
contained in Annex E of CSA Z662 are mandatory for liquid hydrocarbon pipelines.
In British Columbia, pipeline companies are required to develop, implement and maintain Damage
Prevention Programs designed to anticipate and proactively prevent third party damage to pipelines
resulting from unsafe excavation practices. Nationally, a new CSA standard is under development to
establish minimum requirements for damage prevention programs (CSA Z247). This new standard is
multi-sectoral and is being drafted in a form suitable for adoption by reference by all regulators across
Canada.
Quebec has an overarching department of public security that is in charge of public safety. Its main
goal is to reduce the vulnerability of Quebecers to disaster risks by developing a safety culture. The
Department is responsible for administering the Quebec Civil Protection Policy 2014-2024 and the Civil
Protection Act, which both have the primary objective of making Quebec society safer and more
resilient to disasters. Similarly, as infrastructure is being proposed, Quebec’s BAPE (public
environmental hearings board) advises, surveys and consults the public on projects or matters
involving environmental quality issues referred to it by the Minister, including pipeline projects. It then
publishes reports on its inquiries. The BAPE is a government agency with advisory functions and no
decision-making authority. In matters related to pipeline construction projects, the BAPE is primarily
concerned with issues surrounding the safety of proposed infrastructure.

the basis for much of the required
maintenance, testing and
inspections on pipelines.
Pipeline integrity programs must be approved by regulators. Typical integrity management programs
include: inline pipeline inspections, records of the pipeline’s history, operating manuals which include
testing requirements (type, frequency, location etc.), engineering assessments to address issues such
as corrosion, third-party damage and geotechnical hazards, mitigation plans and priorities.
Usually, Inline Inspection (ILI) testing is performed at a frequency determined by the age, material and
product characteristics being transported. Other tests used are based on the results of ILI. This usually
means inspection digs, visual inspection, and non-destructive testing. Companies must also periodically
test instruments and equipment at the pipeline stations to verify their proper and safe operation.
In addition to pipeline operators’ own efforts to maintain, test, and inspect their pipeline
infrastructure, regulators also inspect infrastructure and conduct independent audits. The types of
testing and the frequency and location of such tests depend largely on the products being transmitted,
the location, the line size, the age of the pipeline and issues identified during past integrity audits.
Taken together, this provides a risk-informed model for inspection and verification.
If issues arise that may threaten the protection of property and the environment and the safety of the
public and the company’s employees, pipeline regulators can direct the company to test, inspect or
assess a pipeline in accordance with CSA standards or any other comparable standards. Repairs are to
be carried out in accordance with CSA Z662, the company’s operation manuals and its Pipeline Integrity
Management Program as well as any relevant legislation and regulations.
Spill Data

100 percent of the liquids spilled by these pipelines were completely recovered. All Canadian
jurisdictions make spill data available to the public and many jurisdictions also make broader
compliance reports available to the public. For example, the National Energy Board (NEB) routinely
posts compliance and enforcement actions online.
Compliance, Orders, Penalties, and Fines
Jurisdictions have a variety of tools and powers at their disposal for enforcing compliance and
reprimanding non-compliance. Enforcement options are generally based on significance and severity of
the contravention and the ability to achieve compliance as quickly and effectively as possible.
Enforcement options include administrative penalties, tickets, warning letters, enforcement and
environmental protection orders and prosecution. In all instances, pipeline regulators have the power
to issue advisories, request corrective action, revoke authorizations, impose safety orders that restrict
operations, and issue stop-work orders.
In most instances, pipeline regulators have the authority to levy fines and monetary penalties to
pipeline operators as a result of non-compliance. For example, a company may be prosecuted under
the National Energy Board Act for contravening orders or regulations, ranging from $100,000 and one
year in prison to $1 million and five

II) Preparedness & Response
Federal and provincial pipeline regulatory oversight is aimed at preventing incidents from happening.
However, if an incident occurs, regulators exercise their authority to protect the public, workers,
property, and the environment.
A company’s emergency management program guides response and containment of a spill with
appropriate equipment and personnel. Pipeline companies must have internal or contracted spill first-
responders, and continually educate them on practices and procedures to be followed in the event of
an emergency.
Industry also has voluntary

Emergency Management Program
Emergency management includes all activities done prior to an emergency so that designated
personnel are ready and able to respond quickly and appropriately to an incident. Activities include
identifying hazards; preparing and maintaining an emergency management plan and specific response
procedures; identifying and securing sufficient resources and equipment; and designating response
personnel and ensuring they are suitably equipped to carry out their duties through training, drills and
exercises.
An emergency response plan outlines the necessary steps and decisions required to manage an
emergency situation. It contains specific steps that the operator must take to control the incident. It
also identifies the detailed roles and responsibilities for all responders, and specifies how a company
will work with the appropriate government agencies. Emergency response plans may or may not be
geographically specific. Often, such plans include manuals on how to proceed with the deployment of
emergency personnel, evacuation plans, communication procedures, and protocols.

                                              Safety and Security of Energy Pipelines in Canada: A Report to Ministers
In Canada, the National Energy Board requires companies with federally regulated pipelines to have an
emergency management program. This program must anticipate, prevent, manage and mitigate
conditions during an emergency that could adversely affect property, the environment or safety of the
workers or the public. Companies must design emergency response plans for any event that could
affect the pipeline, including accounting for geographically specific hazards. Similar requirements are
found within British Columbia’s Emergency Management Regulation under the BCOGC.
Operators of provincially regulated pipelines must have an approved emergency response plan
registered with the appropriate regulator or ministry, or, if located in Alberta, British Columbia or
Saskatchewan, must be a member in good standing of Western Canadian Spill Services Ltd. (WCSS) 3 oil
spill cooperatives. WCSS prepares and submits an emergency response plan to the appropriate
regulator on behalf of its members. Going forward, Saskatchewan is considering having all pipeline
companies adhere to an oil spill co-op in each geographic area through which their pipeline is routed,
and British Columbia is considering requiring all potential spillers (including liquid pipelines) to belong
to a province-wide spill response organization similar to Transport Canada’s requirements for marine
traffic.
Nationally, the CSA Group Strategic Steering Committee on Petroleum & Natural Gas Industry Systems
is overseeing the development of a new national standard for Emergency Management that will apply
across the entire petroleum and natural pipelines sector. CSA Z246.2 is scheduled for publication in the
spring of 2015 and will likely be adopted by reference across much of Canada similar to the current use
of CSA Z662.
To test emergency response plans, provinces may require operators to conduct regular emergency
response exercises and to regularly consult with those involved in emergency response procedures.
Outreach activities to inform nearby residents of what to do in case of a pipeline emergency are
considered a best practice.
Some provincial regulators require specific information and tools within or in addition to an operator’s
emergency response plan. For example, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick require operators to produce
an emergency procedures manual in addition to their emergency response plan. Ontario and
Saskatchewan require operators to include a procedure within their emergency response plan to notify
specific government departments or agencies, municipalities, public authorities or members of the
public who may be affected in case of a spill. In Ontario, companies are required to meet with local
police, firefighting and conservation authorities, the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Natural
Resources, the Ministry of the Environment and the Technical Standards and Safety Authority (TSSA) at
set intervals to communicate capabilities and coordination required to respond to emergencies.
The required scope of emergency response plans varies. Most provinces do not require emergency
response plans to be site- or area-specific, and instead require plans that can address a spill onto land
or water from any well, pipeline or facility.
In Quebec, the Civil Protection Act requires regional authorities, in conjunction with their constituent
municipalities, to establish a civil protection plan determining objectives and actions to reduce disaster
vulnerability across their territory. Operators must take additional precautions when installing pipelines

through cultivated land to restore the soil to agricultural use, ensure soil productivity, and to monitor
soil health.
Emergency response plans in Ontario and Alberta must include hazard analysis, risk assessments, and
the identification of high-consequence areas. Emergency response planning must then be structured in
proportion to risks involved in operations. In Ontario, plans for oil pipeline segments located in high-
consequence areas must be provided to the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Ministry of the
Environment for review and comment.
Incident Reporting
There is no standard definition for a “pipeline incident” in Canadian law. Definitions vary by jurisdiction,
which can influence the scale, scope, and pace of a response.
For example, federally, the Transportation Safety Board defines a “reportable pipeline incident” as an
incident resulting directly from the operation of a pipeline where any amount of uncontained and
uncontrolled release of a commodity occurs. The National Energy Board definition of a “pipeline
incident” differentiates between liquid and non-liquid spills. It includes any amount of unintended or
uncontrolled release of gas or high vapour pressure hydrocarbons, and of liquid hydrocarbons in excess
of 1.5m3. Pipeline (and associated facilities such as pumps, valves or compressors) incidents may also
include fires or explosions, death or serious injury to a person, a reduction in the structural integrity of
a pipeline, threats in the vicinity of the pipeline, or the operation of a pipeline beyond design limits.
Provincial regulators have different definitions for pipeline incidents. Incidents may be considered
“reportable” depending on their size, severity, location, type or frequency. For example, definitions
may differ in terms of the minimum volume of a spill constituting a “pipeline incident”, which must be
reported to the regulator.
In some provinces, such as Ontario, a spill of petroleum product of not more than 100 L in areas
restricted to the public, or not more than 25 L in areas with public access may be exempted from
reporting to the Ministry of the Environment and municipalities only if it is unlikely to enter a
watercourse or to cause adverse effects other than those readily and immediately remediated, and
only if records of the spill are maintained. Alberta is unique in that it requires all pipeline failures –
including tests failures, or any contact or damage to a pipeline – to be reported, regardless of the size
of the spill, area affected, status of the pipeline, or type of fluid released.
Response Standards
In the event of a pipeline incident, federal and provincial regulators must be notified immediately by
law. For example, in New Brunswick, the regulator must be immediately notified of any pipeline
incident, and a detailed report must be filed within 48 hours. The province also asks that companies
consider reporting any events having the potential to attract public or media attention or which have
or may have significant adverse effects on property, the environment, or the safety of persons,
regardless of whether or not they meet the strict definition of an “incident” in the Pipeline Act. In
Quebec, licensees must notify the provincial government without delay, or, in cases provided for by
regulation, within the time prescribed, of accidental occurrence in the environment of any
contaminant. In some provinces the pipeline operator must also notify any affected municipality (e.g.
Ontario) or landowner (e.g. Alberta) immediately following a pipeline incident.

Response standards (i.e. response time) vary within Canada, and are specified in each company’s
emergency response plan or emergency procedures manual. These standards may be specified to the
location or type of pipeline.
                                      SPOTLIGHT – Transportation Safety Board
  The Transportation Safety Board (TSB) is an independent agency that reports to Parliament through the
  Leader of the Government in the House of Commons. The TSB advances transportation safety in marine,
  pipeline, rail and air by conducting independent investigations into selected transportation occurrences in
  order to make findings as to their causes and contributing factors by: conducting independent investigations;
  identifying safety deficiencies; making recommendations designed to eliminate or reduce any such safety
  deficiencies; and reporting publicly on its investigations and on the findings in relation thereto.
  In making its findings as to the causes and contributing factors of a transportation occurrence, it is not the
  function of the TSB to assign fault or determine civil or criminal liability. However, the TSB does not refrain
  from fully reporting on the causes and contributing factors merely because fault or liability might be inferred
  from the Board’s findings.
Federally, the National Energy Board oversees a company’s immediate response during a serious
incident and requires that appropriate repair methods be used, in accordance with regulation. British
Columbia takes a similar approach, ensuring that the company’s response is effective and that the
response is coordinated, employing the principles of unified command. In other provinces, serious
incidents are generally overseen by first responders, with regulators providing assistance.
Provincial regulators conduct inspections during and following pipeline incidents. Some regulators can
take control of the response if it is deemed insufficient or inadequate. For example, in New Brunswick
the regulator may enter a spill site to conduct operations as necessary to repair a leak or break, contain
the escaped substance, and prevent further escape. In Quebec, through Urgence-Environnement,
Quebec’s provincial government provides 24/7 response province-wide to minimize the impacts of
environmental emergencies. In major environmental emergencies, the government response is
coordinated by Organisation de la sécurité civile du Québec. In Manitoba, the regulator can take
control of a response if needed, but would only do so in rare exceptions. Instead, most provincial
regulators issue orders to pipeline operators to address insufficient or inadequate responses.
The National Energy Board coordinates follow-up for incidents involving federally regulated pipelines.
Provincial requirements for post-incident follow-up vary depending on the scale of the incident, but
usually involve, at a minimum, the submission of an incident report to the regulator. Additional follow-
up may require monitoring, best practice sharing, communications, or further investigation.
Restoration of Environmental and Natural Resources Damages
In Canada, federal and provincial regulations indicate the extent to which the site of a spill must be
remediated, including damage to wildlife and the environment.
Remediation involves the improvement of a contaminated site to prevent, minimize or mitigate
damage to human health or the environment. It involves the development and application of a planned

Remediation Process Guide.
Almost all provinces have laid out the requirement for remediation of a contaminated site in
regulation. For example, rehabilitation of a site is required under Nova Scotia’s Environment Act,
Ontario’s Environmental Protection Act, and Quebec’s Environment Quality Act. In New Brunswick,
although the need for remediation as a result of a pipeline incident is not laid out in regulation, the
Energy and Utilities Board can deal with smaller cases and issues orders as it determines necessary,
while extreme cases are dealt with within environmental legislation such as the Clean Environment Act.
Some provinces require pipeline operators to develop a remediation plan based on an assessment
identifying all potential risks of a spill and the estimated reclamation cost to reclaim a site. This plan is
then approved by the regulator. For example, in Alberta, the regulator requires all licensees to undergo
an assessment to identify and evaluate all remediation and surface reclamation issues. In British
Columbia, the regulator requires pipeline operators to conduct an assessment of wildlife or natural
resource impact, to develop a regulator-approved remediation plan. The British Columbia Ministry of

implemented to protect human beings, other living species, and the environment in general, including
property, together with an implementation schedule. In Ontario, the Ministry of the Environment
verifies that adequate and appropriate clean-up and remediation has been completed by the
responsible party in an acceptable manner. In Saskatchewan and Manitoba, regulators inspect spill
sites to verify acceptable clean-up and remediation, and contaminated sites are entered into
rehabilitation programs which require the company to complete a remediation plan, submit follow-up
reports to the regulator, and enable additional inspections by the regulator.
Response Equipment
The National Energy Board requires identification, maintenance, and regular checking and certification
of equipment for federally regulated pipelines. Equipment must be readily accessible and positioned as
specified in relevant standards. Companies must also, where practicable maintain materials,
equipment and spare parts in adequate quantities and at suitable locations for use in emergency
repairs. Finally, the NEB requires that employees be instructed in the proper operation of equipment
and emergency equipment.
Most provincial regulators require companies to include within their emergency response plan or
emergency procedures manual a description of the type and location of available emergency
equipment. Generally, companies are not required to report the location of their equipment to the
regulator; however, this information is provided to the regulator upon the submission of a new or
updated emergency response plan. In the event of an emergency, Alberta requires pipeline companies
to provide a list of emergency equipment (including location, number, and type), communications
equipment, equipment for roadblock kits, ignition equipment, and gas monitoring equipment to the
regulator.

of the co-op, which can provide specialized equipment, infrastructure and personnel, should a release
occur. In Quebec, the ministry responsible for environmental emergency response carries specialized
equipment for the majority of emergency situations, and each of its regional branches also carries the
most frequently used equipment.
Drills, Exercises, and Personnel Training
Even the best equipment is useless in untrained hands. That is why regulators require company
employees and their own personnel to be trained and instructed in the proper operation of equipment
and emergency response procedures.
Operators of both federally and provincially regulated pipelines are required to develop training
programs and conduct exercises to verify their capabilities to respond to incidents. Companies
regularly test their emergency response plans through major “live” exercises and tabletop simulations.
In some jurisdictions, like Ontario, companies are required to document drills. Regulators may
participate in these exercises to assess the knowledge and capability of a pipeline operator to respond
should an incident occur. Pipeline companies operating in Quebec regularly conduct emergency
response exercises in the field on a voluntary basis. These exercises normally involve the deployment of
emergency equipment and the participation of first-line responders. The government departments and
agencies likely to be called upon in the situation attend as observers. The provincial government also
regularly holds emergency preparedness exercises involving the participation of municipalities and
private sector partners. In jurisdictions with oil spill co-operatives, members are required to participate
in spill exercises organized by the co-operative, or to organize their own.
The National Energy Board requires processes to be in place to verify that those working on behalf of
the company are trained, competent and able to perform their duties safely and in a manner that
ensures the security of the pipeline and protection of the environment.
Provincial regulators also require training programs for personnel related to construction, operations,
maintenance, and emergency response. For example, in New Brunswick, the required Training Program
for Operators and Contractors ensures that those working on behalf of the company are trained and
competent in performing their duties. In Ontario, companies are required to have an Operator
Qualification Program stating the training, competency and scope of work of employees and
contractors. Emergency response training is included in both programs.

release of environmental pollutants.
These laws typically establish a cost
recovery mechanism that governments may use to hold pipeline operators liable for spill response
costs. In some cases, pipeline operators are also subject to liability where a spill causes government
and/or third party loss or damage.
Comprehensive Liability Regime
All jurisdictions have enshrined ‘polluter pays’ principle in their pipeline management regimes. In all
instances, the operator is liable for any damages caused by the pipeline regardless of fault or
negligence. For example, in Nova Scotia, it is a term and condition of every permit and licence to
construct and operate a pipeline that each holder of the permit or license shall carry adequate
personal injury, property damage and third party liability insurance for losses suffered in the
construction and operation of the pipeline on such terms and in such amounts as determined by the
provincial regulator.
Operators can sometimes minimize their liability if they can prove to a court that all reasonable steps
were taken to prevent a spill. The court would then determine the degree to which a third party
contractor might be responsible.
The Civil Code of Quebec contains provisions regarding civil liability. These state, in particular, that
every person has a duty to abide by the rules of conduct incumbent upon them so as not to cause
injury to another. Where an entity is endowed with reason and fails in their duty, they are liable for any
injury they cause to another by such fault and are bound to make reparation for the injury. This liability
is unlimited. In addition, the Civil Code stipulates that every person has a duty to honour his
contractual undertakings. Where they fail in this duty, they are liable for any bodily, moral or material
injury caused and are bound to make reparation for the injury.
                                                       18
                                         Safety and Security of Energy Pipelines in Canada: A Report to Ministers
For this reason, over-the-counter contracts for hydrocarbon transportation, storage or distribution
services in Quebec usually require valid and current general liability insurance covering personal injury
and damage to property and contractual liability, civil liability insurance (typically for at least $2 million)
as well as environmental liability insurance (typically for at least $10 million) issued by recognized
insurers.
Financial Capacity Requirements
Ensuring operators have sufficient financial capacity is key to a successful liability and compensation
regime. Most provinces have regulations requiring operators to prove that they have sufficient
resources either through insurance or other financial capacity to respond to a spill or other type of
damage. There is not a minimum level, as each province allows the regulator to assess the project and
determine the required financial capacity.
The Government of Canada is considering legislation that will require operators to have sufficient
financial capabilities to respond to an incident. This will include a minimum requirement of $1 billion
for major crude oil pipelines. British Columbia is currently considering a risk based approach, whereby
operators will be required to provide a security deposit to ensure financial capacity based on the level
of risk their project entails.
Independent Financial Backstop
Other than insurance, there are currently very few mechanisms in place in any jurisdiction that allow
for independent financial backstopping. Since March 31, 2007, the Quebec government's consolidated
financial statements have included an environmental liability associated with the costs of contaminated
site rehabilitation. As of March 31, 2013, this liability was estimated at $3.2 billion.
British Columbia has indicated that they are considering proposals but have not made details public.
The Government of Canada announced that it proposes to implement a government financial backstop
to ensure funds are available to the National Energy Board for spill clean-up, should it be required to
assume control of incident response, in exceptional circumstances.
The Alberta Orphan Well Fund acts as an independent financial backstop in the event that a pipeline
operator goes bankrupt in the process of cleaning a spill. The Orphan Well Fund is entirely industry
funded and is used as an alternative to an insurance-based system.
In British Columbia, the BCOGC has developed and implemented an Orphan Fund that can be utilized
for remediation and restoration of orphaned infrastructure. In addition, the Commission maintains
funds under a Liability Management Program under which permit holders are required to maintain a
specific level of financial solvency ensuring financial capacity to respond to major incidents.

Conclusion
Regulators continue to pursue the ultimate objective of zero incidents. Federal and provincial pipeline
regulators continue to work with stakeholders to improve pipeline regulatory regimes by focusing on
the three pillars encompassing: 1) prevention; 2) preparedness and response; and 3) liability and
compensation. Governments are taking steps to ensure that taxpayers are protected from clean-up
costs should an incident occur.
Ensuring a world-class pipeline regulatory regime is critical for Canada to pursue its natural resource
advantage. While most crude oil and natural gas in Canada moves via pipeline, increasing crude oil and
petroleum product volumes are moving via rail and marine. These alternative modes of transportation
are becoming increasingly important for delivering Canada’s resources to markets.
Next Steps
Continuous improvement is an absolute requirement for achieving and maintaining a world-class
energy pipeline regulatory regime in Canada. Building on recent and ongoing pipeline regulatory
improvements across federal, provincial and territorial jurisdictions, areas of focus moving forward
include:
-   Continue implementing proposed legislative, regulatory, and related initiatives while ensuring that
    Aboriginals and other key stakeholders are meaningfully engaged;
-   Commit to further studying and improving the safety and security of broader energy transportation
    systems including rail, marine and trucking;
-   Enhance communications to ensure fact-based dialogue surrounding energy transportation;
-   Explore options for improved cooperation and collaboration between jurisdictions either through
    harmonization, sharing or leveraging information and expertise;
           o For instance, the harmonization of performance measures such as spill reporting
                remains an important impediment to measuring the progress of companies across
                jurisdictions.
-   Explore opportunities for enhanced collaboration on pipeline innovation between governments,
    regulators and industry – for example, “Best Available Technologies” recognized through the
    Canadian Pipeline Technology Collaborative;
-   Continue to cooperate in efforts to enhance the safety and security of hydrocarbon production and
    transportation systems, including damage prevention and cyber security.

                                       Prevention
               The Pipeline Act, 2005 and associated Pipeline Regulation, 2006-2 outline the
               procedures and methods required during the design, construction, operation
               and maintenance of pipelines and stipulate that the responsibility for these
               requirements lie with the companies who own and operate the pipelines.
               Also, Guidance Notes are provided to companies to assist in understanding the
               requirements of the Pipeline Regulation, 2006-2 and how those requirements
               could be met. The actual methods used to meet the specific requirements are
               at the discretion of individual companies, but the onus is on each company to
               maintain adequate records and demonstrate the adequacy and effectiveness
Safety culture
               of the methods employed to the New Brunswick Energy and Utilities Board
               (EUB), when requested.
               Section 38 of the regulation requires that a corporation develop and
               implement a pipeline integrity management program.
               Further to the above, Section 4 of the Pipeline Regulation, 2006-2 states that
               the CSA Z662 – Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems standard shall govern the design,
               construction, operation and abandonment of a pipeline. The latest edition of
               this standard requires that a pipeline company implement a Safety and Loss
               Management system.
               Applicable standards and specifications:
                       CSA Z276, if the pipeline transports liquefied natural gas;
                       CSA Z341 for the underground storage of hydrocarbons; and
                       CSA Z662, if the pipeline transports liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons or
                        minerals as defined in the Act.
               The regulation allows for alternate standards to be used, if approved by the
Standards      EUB and if they provide for a level of safety or protection at least equivalent to
               the level of safety or protection generally provided for by a comparable CSA
               standard or by another applicable standard; or, in the absence of a
               comparable CSA or other applicable standard, it provides for a level of safety
               or protection that is adequate in the circumstances.
               Also, the required Emergency Procedures Manual under Section 31 of the
               Pipeline Regulation must conform to the standard CSA Z731 Emergency
               Preparedness and Response for industry.

                       Most standards are continually reviewed using strict revision and approval
                       protocols by a knowledgeable and experienced group of professionals
                       representing the industry stakeholders. Specifically, the Z662 is revised and
                       published on a 4-year basis. For the past 12 years, the EUB Director of Pipeline
                       Safety has been a member of the main Technical Committee of the Z662 as a
                       full voting committee member and on the Gas Distribution Technical Sub-
                       Committee of the Z662 as well as the Technical Sub-Committee of the B137.4
                       Polyethylene Piping Systems Fittings for Gas Services. This person also is a
                       member of the CSA Regulatory Authority Committee for the group of CSA
                       standards used in the oil and gas industry.
                       Any equipment used for integrity testing of pipelines must be tested and
                       calibrated within the manufacturer’s recommended timelines. The certificate
                       of testing must be available at the location of testing and be maintained on
                       file.
                       The types of testing and the frequency and location of such tests depend
                       largely on the products being transmitted, the age of the pipeline and issues
                       identified during past integrity audits. Usually Inline Inspection (ILI) testing is
                       performed at a frequency determined by the age, material and product
                       characteristics being transported. Other tests used are based on the results of
Maintenance and        ILI. This usually means inspections digs, visual inspection, and non-destructive
                       testing. The companies must also periodically test instruments and equipment
testing
                       at the pipeline stations to verify their proper and safe operation.
                       The company’s Pipeline Integrity Manual must clearly outline the types and
                       frequency of testing specific to each pipeline owned. Also, if issues arise that
                       may threaten the protection of property and the environment, and the safety
                       of the public and the company’s employees, the Board may direct the
                       company to test, inspect or assess a pipeline in accordance with CSA standards
                       or any other comparable standards.
                       Repairs shall be carried out in accordance with Section 10 in the Z662, the
                       company’s operation manuals and Pipeline Integrity Manual, and the Pipeline
                       Act and regulations.
                       The Pipeline Act, 2005 empowers the EUB to inspect and audit a company’s
                       records and any pipeline and associated facilities. Audits are carried out by the
                       EUB and are primarily aimed at determining compliance with the Pipeline
                       Regulation and the company’s Pipeline Integrity Management Plan. The
Inspections and audits frequency of compliance audits is based on a number of factors such as past
                       compliance issues, the safety culture present, the company’s internal audits,
                       etc. All construction is inspected on a daily basis and the final construction
                       turnover package is audited for completeness. Also, the Pipeline Regulation
                       requires that the companies conduct their own internal inspections and audits.

                   Companies are required to have an emergency management program. Section
                   31 of the Pipeline Regulation deals with emergency procedures manuals. CSA
Emergency          Z731 Emergency Preparedness and Response for industry is referenced. The
management program Guidance Notes also provide some direction for companies preparing such
                   plans. The plans must be comprehensive in nature, with the main focus being
                   the protection of life, property and the environment.
                   The EUB must be notified immediately of any incidents (regardless of scale) as
                   defined in the Pipeline Act and a detailed report must be filed with the Board
                   within 48 hours.
                   The Guidance Notes ask that companies consider reporting to the EUB events
                   having the potential to attract public and/or media attention or which have or
                   may have significant adverse effects on property, the environment or the
                   safety of persons, regardless of whether or not they meet the strict definition
                   of an "incident".
                   Response standards vary and are specific to the location and type of pipeline.
Response standards The standards are stated in a company’s Emergency Procedures Manual.
                   First responders such as the fire or police department oversee more serious
                   incidents. The EUB’s role in these situations is to ensure that
                   pipeline-related evidence is secured, and to be available to first responders as
                   needed.
                   The EUB has the power to conduct their own investigations and also works
                   closely with the emergency and police agencies having jurisdiction. The EUB
                   reviews incidents with the pipeline operator and as a result of the investigation
                   may issue orders or directions to the pipeline operator. Most operators use

                      Section 20 of the Pipeline Act, 2005 states that the Board shall not issue a
                      permit or license to any person unless the person is insured by an insurance
                      company licensed to do business in the Province, and in an amount approved
                      by the Board.
                      The company’s insurance policy must be approved by the EUB prior to the
Comprehensive         issuance of a License to Operate and this is a condition for maintaining this

                      The Pipeline Act, 2005 is silent on whether companies are liable for costs
                      associated with abandoned pipelines. A condition is added to any EUB
                      approval for pipeline abandonment, stating: The Board's consent to an
                      abandonment operation does not relieve (the applicant) from any liability with
                      respect to this pipeline or part or part thereof.

                                         Prevention
               The MSP [Department of Public Security] is in charge of public safety in
               Quebec. Its main goal is to reduce the vulnerability of Quebecers to disaster
               risks by developing a culture of safety. The Department is responsible for
               administering the Québec Civil Protection Policy 2014-2024 and the Civil
               Protection Act, which both have the primary objective of making Quebec
               society safer and more resilient to disasters.
               In terms of public protection, the RBQ [Quebec building authority] is
               responsible for the quality of construction and the safety of buildings and
               facilities, as well as professional qualifications and the integrity of contractors
               and owners-builders. The RBQ fulfills its mandate by enacting and
               administering construction, safety and professional qualification standards. It
               oversees compliance with these standards through investigations and audits,
               applying legislative remedies in the event of non-compliance and establishing
               financial guarantees to protect consumers. The RBQ is also a recognized
               authority in the inspection and verification of quality control programs for
               pressure vessels.
               The BAPE [Public environmental hearings board] is a public and non-partisan
               agency reporting to the Minister of the MDDELCC [Department of Sustainable
               Development, Environment and the Fight Against Climate Change]. Its mission
Safety culture is to inform government policy-making related to sustainable development,
               encompassing ecological, social and economic factors. To fulfill this core
               mission, the BAPE advises, surveys and consults the public on projects or
               matters involving environmental quality issues referred to it by the Minister,
               including pipeline projects. It then publishes reports on its inquiries for the
               public. The BAPE is a government agency with advisory functions and no
               decision-making authority. In matters related to pipeline construction projects,
               the BAPE is primarily concerned with issues surrounding the safety of the
               proposed infrastructures.
               As regards the prevention of damage to underground or other infrastructures,
               Info-Excavation offers a range of services to ensure public and worker safety,
               protect the environment and maintain essential public services. Info-
               Excavation is a not-for-profit organization that operates a free one-call centre
               to handle requests for locating underground facilities, particularly pipelines.
               The organization is the authority in Quebec for the development and
               promotion of best practices for preventing damage to underground
               infrastructure and maintaining public services. Info-Excavation's members
               include 125 companies and 70 municipalities. In Quebec, it is not mandatory to
               request a locate before digging. However, Info-Excavation strongly
               recommends always dialling before digging, given the economic, physical
               and/or environmental impacts of a breach.

                           Safety and Security of Energy Pipelines in Canada: A Report to Ministers
          As in other Canadian jurisdictions, companies operating pipelines in Quebec
          must comply with the technical design, construction and operation standards
          of various recognized standards organizations, including the Canadian
          Standards Association (CSA), the American Petroleum Institute (API), the
          American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American Society for
          Testing and Materials (ASTM), Underwriters Laboratories of Canada (ULC) and
          the National Research Council Canada (NRCC).
          In Quebec, the requirement to comply with these technical standards is usually
          imposed by stipulations in Acts and regulations (e.g.: the Construction Code
          and Safety Code, administered by the RBQ).
          In addition, the following are subject to the environmental impact assessment
          and review procedure provided for under the Environment Quality Act and
          require a government-issued certificate of authorization (CA): the construction
          of installations for natural gas gasification or liquefaction and the construction
          of more than 2 km of oil pipeline in a new right-of-way, except conduits for
          transporting petroleum products under a municipal street, and the
          construction of a gas pipeline more than 2 km in length. Excluded are the
          construction of such a gas pipeline in an existing right-of-way used for the
          same purposes, and the installation of gas mains less than 30 cm in diameter
Standards designed for a pressure of less than 4,000 kPa.
          Certificates of authorization issued by government decree normally include
          safety and environmental protection conditions. For example, decree 207-
          2010, dated March 17, 2010, with respect to the Pipeline Saint-Laurent project
          sponsored by Ultramar Ltd. (now Valero), includes the following conditions:

                   CONDITION 9: Emergency measures plan
                   Ultramar Ltd. must map the high pressure zone of 0.3 lb. per sq. in. for
                   all sectors with potential fuel vapour containment when evaluating the
                   risk of explosion as part of its emergency measures planning.
                   Ultramar Ltd. must develop its emergency measures plan in
                   consultation with the municipalities concerned, the Department of
                   Public Security, the Department of Health and Social Services,
                   Transports Québec, the Department of sustainable development,
                   environment and parks, and, as required, any adjacent industries. The
                   plan must be filed with the Minister of sustainable development,
                   environment and parks at the same time as the application for the

                      4, 2011 and is updated weekly.
                      Also as provided in the Environment Quality Act, the MDDELCC publishes on its
                      website a register of monetary administrative penalties relating to violations of
                      the Act or its regulations. These penalties are imposed by CCEQ regional
                      directors on any person or municipality failing to comply with the Act or its
                      regulations. The register has been kept since February 1, 2012 and is updated
                      at the beginning of each month.
                      Under the penal provisions of the Environment Quality Act, a fine of $5,000 to
Orders, penalties and $1,000,000 or a maximum term of imprisonment of 18 months, or both, in the
fines                 case of a natural person, and a fine of $15,000 to $6,000,000 for a legal entity,
                      are provided for whoever contravenes the standards governing the discharge
                      of contaminants into the environment or the requirement to inform the
                      Minister of the MDDELCC without delay of the accidental presence in the
                      environment of a contaminant and to take immediate measures to minimize
                      or eliminate the effects of the event or incident and to eliminate the causes
                      thereof.
                      Maximum penalties apply in cases where the harm or damage caused by the
                      offence to human health or the environment, including vegetation and
                      wildlife, is sufficiently serious to justify heavier penalties.
                      The stipulated fines are doubled for a second offence, and tripled for any
                      subsequent offence. The maximum term of imprisonment for a second offence
                      increases to five years less a day.
                      When an offence under the Act or its regulations is committed by an
                      administrator or director of a legal entity, a corporation or an association
                      without legal personality, the minimum and maximum fines are twice those
                      imposed on a natural person for the same offence.
                      When an offence under the Act or its regulations persists for more than one
                      day, it constitutes a separate offence for each day the event or incident
                      continues.

                         Preparedness Response and Recovery
                   The Civil Protection Act, administered by the Department of Public Security,
                   imposes mandatory reporting of any risk-generating activities to the local
                   municipality where the source of the risk is located. In unorganized territory as
                   well as in the case where reports must be made in more than one locality, the
                   person may report the risk either to each competent regional authority or to
                   the Minister of Public security. A monitoring procedure, a procedure for
                   warning authorities and any other safety measures deemed necessary must be
                   maintained.
                   Through Urgence-Environnement, the MDDELCC provides 24/7 response
                   province-wide to ensure that everything possible is done to minimize the
                   impacts of environmental emergencies.

                   measures to protect the environment are promptly taken.
                   In the event of a major environmental emergency, government response is
                   coordinated by the Organisation de la sécurité civile du Québec (OSCQ) [civil
                   protection organization], which reports to the Department of Public Security.
                   The organization of the Quebec government's civil protection actions falls
                   within the framework of the National Civil Protection Plan, which provides for
                   responses to 15 needs likely to arise in a disaster situation. In the plan, these
                   needs are translated into the concept of "missions". Each mission is assigned
                   to the government department or agency whose regular tasks and activities
                   most closely resemble those entailed in the mission, or who have the expertise
                   required to take charge of the mission (e.g. the MDDELCC mission relating to
                   water and hazardous and residual materials).

                 Safety and Security of Energy Pipelines in Canada: A Report to Ministers
In accordance with its mission, which is to guarantee for future generations
land suitable for the practice and development of agricultural activities and, to
this end, to ensure the preservation of agricultural land and contribute to
stakeholder engagement in achieving this objective, the CPTAQ [commission
for the preservation of agricultural land] is responsible for deciding on
applications for authorization submitted to it pursuant to the Act respecting
the preservation of agricultural land and agricultural activities regarding the
use for purposes other than agriculture, subdivision or alienation of a lot and
applications for the inclusion of a lot in an agricultural zone, to issue the
operating permits required for the removal of topsoil and sod, to supervise the
administration of the Act by conducting appropriate investigations and audits
and applying sanctions for offences as required, to advise the government on
any matters relating to the preservation of agricultural land, and to issue a
notice regarding any matter referred to it pursuant to the Act. The Act applies
over all Quebec territory south of the 50th parallel.
When authorizing, for the purpose of installing a pipeline, the alienation and
non-agricultural use of land for the uses and lots in each municipality and the
entire area targeted by the project, the CPTAQ generally imposes the following
conditions for the protection and/or restoration of environmental and natural
resources:
        The pipeline must be installed at a minimum depth of 1.6 metres
         through cultivated land (including forested areas restored to
         agricultural use following the work) and 1.2 metres in forested areas.
         However, a depth of 1.2 metres may be required on cultivated land,
         and 0.9 metre in forested areas, if the bedrock is reached at or above
         this depth. Also, the depth to which agricultural and forestry works
         may be carried out before the company needs to be notified is 60
         centimetres on cultivated land and 45 centimetres in forested areas.
         The company does not need to be notified of work using a subsoil
         plough.
        The duration of work to install the pipeline and restore the soil to
         agricultural use must not exceed two growing seasons. The project
         must not adversely affect drainage or soil productivity. The project
         sponsor has one year following completion of the soil restoration to
         ensure that the cultivated soil disturbed is restored to the same level
         of productivity as it had prior to the pipeline installation.
        The project sponsor is required to monitor soil health for a period of
         seven (7) years following completion of the restoration work. Within
         three (3) months of completion of the soil restoration, the sponsor
         must provide the CPTAQ with the name and contact information of
         the person who will act as liaison to ensure compliance with this
         condition, throughout the seven-year period.

                                Liability and Compensation
                 The Civil Code of Québec contains provisions regarding civil liability. These
                 state, in particular, that every person has a duty to abide by the rules of
                 conduct incumbent on him, according to the circumstances, usage or law, so
                 as not to cause injury to another. Where he is endowed with reason and fails
                 in this duty, he is liable for any injury he causes to another by such fault and is
                 bound to make reparation for the injury, whether it be bodily, moral or
                 material in nature. This liability is unlimited. He is also bound, in certain cases,
                 to make reparation for injury caused to another by the act or fault of another
                 person or by the act of things in his custody.
                 In addition, the Civil Code stipulates that every person has a duty to honour his
                 contractual undertakings. Where he fails in this duty, he is liable for any bodily,
                 moral or material injury he causes to the other contracting party and is bound
                 to make reparation for the injury; neither he nor the other party may in such a
                 case avoid the rules governing contractual liability by opting for rules that
                 would be more favourable to them.
Comprehensive
                 In this respect, over-the-counter contracts for hydrocarbon transportation,
liability regime
                 storage or distribution services usually require valid and current general
                 liability insurance covering personal injury and damage to property and
                 contractual liability, civil liability insurance (typically for at least $2 million) as
                 well as environmental liability insurance (typically for at least $10 million)
                 issued by recognized insurers.
                 The Civil Code provides for certain cases of exemption from this liability. It
                 states that a person may free himself from his liability for injury caused to
                 another by proving that the injury results from superior force, unless he has
                 undertaken to make reparation for it. Superior force is an unforeseeable and
                 irresistible event, including external causes with the same characteristics.
                 However, a person may not exclude or limit his liability for material injury
                 caused to another through an intentional or gross fault; a gross fault is a fault
                 which shows gross recklessness, gross carelessness or gross negligence. He
                 may not in any way exclude or limit his liability for bodily or moral injury
                 caused to another.

                                       Prevention
               Pipeline operating companies are required to establish a management system
               with clearly defined roles and responsibilities. The management system must
               be kept up to date and is audited by the Technical Standards & Safety
               Authority (TSSA) every five years. Safety reports are to be provided upon
               request by the TSSA and must be signed accordingly by the appropriate
               authority as specified in the management system.
               Under Section 90 of the Ontario Energy Board (OEB) Act, the OEB’s approval
               for construction of new pipelines is conditional upon the applicant’s
               compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements including the design
               specifications, operation, maintenance, safety and integrity requirements
               under the TSSA mandate.
Safety culture
               The TSSA has forums to discuss issues regarding pipelines:
                    1) Natural Gas Council: A TSSA steering group typically chaired by a
                        representative from industry, which meets every six months.
                    2) Risk Reduction Group (RRG) on Pipelines: a group chaired by a TSSA
                        representative meeting as frequently as required to address technical
                        pipeline safety issues. Corrective actions, deadlines and the party
                        responsible for the actions are identified.
               Prior to excavation, the location of utility lines must be requested through
               Ontario One Call or the utility at or near the excavation to prevent
               inadvertently damaging pipelines and other utility lines. Warning signs and
               markers along the pipeline right-of-way must be maintained.
               The Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems Code Adoption Document (CAD) contains the
               adopted and modified national standards that are applicable to Ontario. The
               national standards are issued by the Canadian Standards Association (CSA).
               The TSSA serves on technical committees and typically adopts and modifies
               national standards, which are updated periodically. The following standards
               are adopted and modified in the CAD as part of the Ontario Regulation 210/01
               on Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems under the Technical Standards and Safety Act:
Standards      CSA Z662-11 Oil & Gas Pipeline Systems, CSA Z276-11 Liquefied Natural Gas
               Production, Storage and Handling, CSA Z246.1-09 Security Management for
               Petroleum and Natural Gas Industry Systems. The TSSA recommends the TSSA
               Guidelines for Natural Gas Utilities Locating New Pipeline Facilities PI-98-01
               and CSA Plus 663, Land use planning for pipelines: A guideline for local
               authorities, developers, and pipeline operators – to municipalities, developers,

                       Pipeline safety and integrity is primarily the responsibility of pipeline operating
                       companies. O.Reg. 210/01 on Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems requires that
                       operators of high-pressure pipelines must have a Pipeline Integrity
                       Management Program in place to ensure that pipeline companies have proper
                       controls to mitigate safety risks. A Pipeline Integrity Management Program
                       includes in-line pipeline inspections, records of the pipeline history, operation
                       manual and documentation required to develop and implement the integrity
                       management program. These documents must be available for inspection by
                       the TSSA. The program requires an engineering assessment of the pipeline to
                       address issues such as corrosion, 3rd party damage and geotechnical hazards.
Maintenance and
                       Criteria for assigning pipeline repair priorities and procedures for mitigation
testing
                       shall also be established. The short term (1 to 3 year) and long-term (4-10
                       year) mitigation program plans and priorities must also be outlined. The
                       Pipeline Integrity Management Program is audited approximately every five
                       years by the TSSA. Pipeline companies are required to have an Operation and
                       Maintenance Manual for the pipeline system specifying the testing
                       requirements (type, frequency, locations, pipeline size, etc.) of the pipeline
                       systems, including related instruments and/or equipment. The Operation and
                       Maintenance Manual must comply with standards in the CAD and must be
                       updated annually. Any changes to the manual must undergo a change
                       management process to ensure their compliance with standards.
                       The TSSA audits oil transmission pipelines and natural gas transmission and
                       distribution pipelines approximately every five years. Documentation is
Inspections and audits
                       typically audited by the TSSA to prove that the requirements under CSA Z662,
                       the CAD, and manuals are met.

                   Response standards in the event of an incident should be outlined in the
                   pipeline company’s Emergency Procedures Manual. The TSSA investigates
                   incidents as required in the regulation (i.e. involving death, injuries, fire,
                   explosion, media attention, substantial damage). The TSSA cannot take control
                   of the response if it is deemed insufficient or inadequate but can issue orders
                   as required. Inspectors release a report as a follow-up after an incident.

                                        Prevention
               The Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) has a long history of regulating pipeline
               companies and is unique in North America in that it requires all pipeline
               failures to be reported regardless of the size of the spill, area affected or type
               of fluid released. This process has created an industrial culture characterized
               by a safety first attitude.
Safety culture
               Inspections are based on a three-tiered model: baseline inspections; random
               inspections; and a prioritized system that takes into account a company’s
               history, location of the facility, and the type of resource being developed. This
               system ensures that all licensees make safety and compliance their most
               important priority.
               The AER ensures that the design, construction, operation, and maintenance –
               including discontinuation and abandonment of regulated pipelines (the full
               pipeline life cycle) complies with Alberta’s Pipeline Act, Pipeline Rules, and
               applicable Canadian Standards Association (CSA) standards.
               The AER incorporates several standards of the CSA for the regulation of
               pipelines, as stated in the Pipeline Rules Section 9. The primary standard is CSA
               Z662 – Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems, which sets out the technical standards for
               the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of Canada’s oil and gas
               pipelines, and is the mandatory starting point for pipelines in Alberta.
               CSA Z662 contains provisions for addressing system integrity, with the 2003
Standards
               S1-05 edition introducing Annex N: “Guidelines for pipeline system integrity
               management programs”. This non-mandatory annex is enforced as mandatory
               in Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) Directive 077 in Alberta.
               Therefore, the AER requires pipeline licensees to develop, implement, and
               document for all of their pipelines a pipeline integrity management program
               that complies with the latest edition of CSA Z662, Annex N.
               The AER requires that the leak detection requirements contained in Annex E of
               CSA Z662 be mandatory for liquid hydrocarbon pipelines.
               If a failure occurs on any portion of a licensed pipeline, that failure is
               reportable and made mandatory through the Pipeline Act (Part 6, Section 35).

                       The AER requires companies to develop and implement integrity management
                       programs to identify, manage, monitor, and address any potential hazard
                       associated with each individual pipeline.
                       Companies must have management systems to design, construct, operate and
                       maintain pipelines.
Maintenance and
                       Pipeline integrity is the primary responsibility of a pipeline licensee. The AER
testing
                       requires companies to take a system-wide integrated approach to keeping
                       their pipeline in sound operating condition.
                       As part of the risk assessment process, the pipeline licensee determines the
                       type and frequency of the physical condition (integrity) assessments of the
                       pipeline.
                       The AER's pipeline-inspection program considers pipeline fluid characteristics,
                       location, line size, failure history, and the company’s compliance history.
                       Pipelines with greater potential risks are given a higher inspection priority.
                       The AER conducts comprehensive incident investigations after serious
                       incidents occur to determine the cause of a pipeline failure and what can be
                       done to prevent a similar situation in the future.
                       The AER performs proactive random inspections and uses a system of
                       inspections based on a prioritization model called “OSI”.
                       The “OSI” system takes into account a variety of factors that help determine
                       the necessary frequently to inspect a particular facility.
Inspections and audits         “O” stands for “operator history” – this is the company’s history of
                                complying with AER regulations. If an operator has a poor track record,
                                the AER will inspect its facilities with greater frequency.
                               “S” represents “site sensitivity” – this is where the AER takes into
                                account the location of the facility. If it is located near a heavily
                                populated area or a wetland, it becomes an inspection priority.
                               “I” refers to “inherent risk” – this is where the AER considers the
                                nature of the resource being extracted or transported. For example,
                                high vapor pressure fluids such as propane or ethane would warrant
                                more frequent inspections.
                       Besides prioritizing inspections by the OSI system, the AER inspectors routinely
                       conduct proactive random inspections.

                      Regulated companies routinely report to the AER. The policy and processes
                      under the AER’s Compliance Assurance Program subject licensees to a series of
                      internal audits, reporting, and accountability processes. This Program uses a
                      risk matrix and compliance categories for administering and tracking
                      enforcement and identifying licensees that are persistently noncompliant in
                      their asset integrity processes and emergency management programs. The
                      predetermined risk of each AER requirement then determines the response
                      process as detailed in Directive 019: Compliance Assurance.
Compliance and spill  The AER publishes a comprehensive annual compliance report for all AER
data                  compliance categories. Incident reports, which may contain specific
                      noncompliance and related enforcement action information, are also
                      published.
                      Stakeholders may also contact licensees regarding specific compliance
                      information.
                      If a licensee does not release the information, stakeholders may use the
                      Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act process to request the
                      information.
                      The AER has a range of enforcement options to ensure compliance, including
                      administrative penalties, tickets and warning letters, enforcement and
                      environmental protection orders, and prosecution.
                      The AER has the power to order an individual or company to pay an
                      administrative penalty if it does not comply with energy resource legislation or
                      approvals, including regional plans under the Alberta Land Stewardship Act.
                      Penalties need to be issued within two years after the date on which the
Orders, penalties and incident occurred or the date on which the incident first came to the notice of
fines                 the AER – whichever is later.
                      The maximum penalties for a person who is guilty of offence under the
                      Pipeline Act are $500,000 for corporations and $50,000 for individuals. Parties
                      are not considered guilty of an offence under the Act if they took all
                      reasonable steps, on a balance of probabilities, to prevent the offence.
                      If a company is incapable of implementing its emergency response plan, the
                      AER can deny a licence application, shut-in facilities, or suspend licences until
                      the company demonstrates otherwise.

                          Preparedness Response and Recovery
                   Emergency preparedness and response includes all activities done prior to an
                   emergency so that designated personnel are ready and able to respond quickly
                   and appropriately, as well as those activities that take place during the
                   incident. This includes activities such as identifying hazards, preparing and
                   maintaining emergency response plans and response procedures, ensuring
                   that the emergency response plans identify sufficient resources and
                   equipment for use by response personnel during an emergency, and
                   designating response personnel and ensuring that they are suitably equipped
                   to carry out their duties through training, drills, and exercises.
                   The AER requires all license holders to have an emergency management
                   program. These programs are to include hazard analyses, risk assessments,
                   mitigation and prevention planning, training, and emergency response
                   planning in proportion to the risks involved in their operations. Reviews and
                   updates of these programs are to be conducted at least annually.
Emergency          The AER’s Directive 71 Emergency Preparedness and Response Requirements
management program for the Upstream Petroleum Industry requires companies to have in place
                   comprehensive emergency response plans.
                   Emergency response plans define the actions a company will take should a
                   failure occur. This includes identifying the detailed roles and responsibilities of
                   all responders and how the company will work with appropriate local and
                   provincial government agencies.
                   These plans do not need to be site specific. Instead, the emergency response
                   plans must address a liquid spill onto land or water from any well, pipeline or
                   facility. The plan must include purchasing spill clean-up equipment and
                   conducting annual exercises.
                   Site-specific emergency response plans are not required for every drilling,
                   production, or pipeline operation in the province. When a site-specific
                   emergency response plan is not required, a corporate-level emergency
                   response plan is used by the licensee to handle emergency events.

                   release and contain and clean up the spill (Pipeline Rules Section 77). The AER
                   does have a series of requirements that must be followed upon a spill being
                   detected: the licensee must verbally report to the AER immediately, and the
                   industry operator must notify the landowner of any release that occurs off-
                   lease, migrates off-lease or occurs on an easement or right-of-way.
Response standards
                   The Field Operations branch deals with response to leaks and breaks, the
                   internal emergency response plan describes the process and timelines for
                   responding to incidents and performing follow-up investigation.
                   Additionally, Oil Spill Cooperatives maintain spill contingency plans and
                   strategically place OSCARS (Oil Spill Containment and Recovery units) that are
                   enacted immediately after the detection of a spill.
                   Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development requires pipeline
                   operators to clean up and remediate the site of any spill. This includes
                   repairing the soil and any wildlife impacted by the spill.

                   When pipelines pass through or near populated areas, roads, railways or water
                   bodies, AER regulatory requirements intensify. When pipelines pass through
                   sensitive areas, operators must adhere to additional requirements, including:
                   reducing operating pressure, using thicker-walled pipeline, pipe being buried
Geographically     at greater depths, and increased inspections and surveillance.
specific plans     In some instances, the AER requires the identification of an emergency
                   planning zone (EPZ). An EPZ is a geographical area surrounding a well, pipeline,
                   or facility containing hazardous product that requires specific emergency
                   response planning by the licensee. The development of an EPZ is based on a
                   project-by-project assessment.

                    AER regulations require all pipeline companies to belong to an oil spill co-op in
                    each geographic area through which their pipeline is routed, or submit their
                    own spill response plan for their specific local operations to the AER for
                    approval.
                    Oil spill co-ops provide immediate emergency response capabilities in all areas
                    of Alberta through the provision of specialized equipment, infrastructure, and
                    personnel, should a release occur. Funding for spill co-ops comes entirely from
                    industry and is administered through Western Canadian Spill Services.
                    The AER requires Pipeline companies to have extensive maintenance and
                    repair programs and operate “leak detection systems” to monitor pipeline
                    integrity. The AER requires that the leak detection requirements contained in
                    Annex E of CSA Z662 be mandatory for liquid hydrocarbon pipelines.
                    In the event of an emergency, AER Directive 071 requires pipeline companies
                    to provide a list of emergency equipment (including location, number, and
                    type) of the following:
Response equipment
                             communications equipment for the public safety coordinator, rovers,
                              roadblock and air monitoring personnel, and any others that require it
                              (the licensee is responsible for ensuring that communications
                              equipment is made available to key response personnel);
                             equipment for roadblock kits (including contents);
                             ignition equipment that is maintained on site; and
                             gas monitoring equipment.
                    The AER requires operators to train emergency response personnel and
                    regularly test their emergency response plans through major “live” exercises
                    and tabletop simulations. The AER’s participation in and awareness of these
Response drills and exercises allows it to assess the knowledge and capability of a pipeline

                    In situations where an operator is unable or unwilling to take the necessary
                    actions during an incident, the AER has the authority and expertise to do so.

                   The AER requires companies to provide training sessions to ensure that
                   response personnel are competent in emergency response procedures. The
                   licensee is expected to provide ERP training on: the overall plan, roles and
                   responsibilities during an incident, public protection measures used during an
                   emergency, and available communication methods.
                   Licensees are required to belong to oil spill co-ops that provide training and
Personnel training guidance for pipeline operators.
                   If a licensee is unable to implement an emergency response plan the AER has
                   trained staff capable of immediately undertaking this work.
                   Additionally, Cooperatives maintain spill contingency plans and strategically
                   place OSCARS (Oil Spill Containment and Recovery units) that are available to
                   all member companies in the area. They hold annual training exercises and
                   provide educational funding for their membership.

                 Alberta holds all licensees responsible for spill clean-up and remediation
                 regardless of fault. The AER has an absolute no-fault liability which requires
                 the licensee pay for all costs associated with emergency response, clean-up
                 and restoration.
                 The AER holds all licensees liable for the cost of spill clean-up and remediation
                 regardless of whether the licensee is responsible for a spill or not. Alberta has
                 a system of absolute at fault and no fault liability whereby the licensee mast
                 pay all costs required to clean a spill and restore the area.
                 Unlimited liability for clean-up and remediation is addressed under the

liability regime In the upstream oil and gas industry, an orphan is a well, pipeline, facility or
                 associated site which has been investigated and confirmed as not having any
                 legally responsible or financially able party to deal with its abandonment and
                 reclamation.
                 The Orphan Well Association (OWA) is a not for profit organization unique to
                 the province of Alberta which was created from the work of many genuinely
                 concerned individuals from the oil and gas industry and from the provincial
                 government. It operates under the delegated authority of the AER. The
                 purpose of the OWA is to manage the abandonment and reclamation of
                 upstream oil and gas orphan wells, pipelines, facilities and their associated
                 sites.

                      The AER uses a Licensee Liability Rating (LLR) Program to prevent the costs to
                      suspend, abandon, remediate, and reclaim a well, facility, or pipeline from
                      being borne by the public of Alberta should a licensee become defunct.
                      The LLR system assesses a licensee’s ability to address its suspension,
                      abandonment, remediation, and reclamation liabilities. Under the program,
                      each operator must pay a security deposit if its deemed liabilities exceed its
                      deemed assets.
Financial capacity    Under Directive 19, if a licensee fails to comply with the requirements of the

                             partial or full suspension of operations;
                             suspension and/or cancellation of permit, licence or approval; or
                             issuance of an Order, which is a legal document that formally orders a

                              abandonments.
                      Alberta’s Orphan Fund pays the costs to suspend, abandon, remediate, and
                      reclaim a well, facility, or pipeline included in the LLR Program if a licensee or
                      working interest participant becomes defunct.
                      The Orphan Fund is fully funded by licensees in the AER’s LLR Program. A
Independent financial licensee's annual levy is based on its proportionate share of sector liability as
backstop/fund         determined by the LLR.
                      The Orphan Fund is administered by the Alberta Oil and Gas Orphan

Enbridge missing two key permits for Westover site
Joan Walters
Hamilton Spectator | Jul 24, 2013
UNDER PRESSURE
Public interest is ramping up regarding the plan by Enbridge Pipelines Inc. to
make changes in a 38­year­old pipeline that runs from its Westover pumping
station in Flamborough to Montreal, known as Line 9B. The company has
already received approval for the section of pipeline from Sarnia to Hamilton.
LINE 9B FACTS
Size: 30­inch diameter pipe
Length:  830 kilometres
Current capacity:  240,000 barrels per day
                                                                                         Enbridge's Line 9 pumping station under constuction along Concession 6,
Proposed capacity:   300,000 barrels per day                                             west of Flamborough.
Current flow:  Transports crude oil from areas such as the North Sea, West Africa
and the Middle East, in a westbound direction.
Flow reversal: Would be done to transport western Canadian crude from Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba to supply the
Quebec refining market.
Work to be done at Westover:    Replace some pipes, add some new valves and start flowing oil into all eight storage tanks on the site,
instead of just the two tanks used now. Electrical work is also part of the changeover.
Time frame:  If permission is granted by National Energy Board at a hearing scheduled for sometime this fall, work to reverse the
flow would begin early in 2014 and potentially be in service during the second quarter of next year.

Enbridge Pipelines Inc. — the company responsible for the largest onshore oil spill in United States history — has been told
by Ontario regulators it is missing two key environmental permits at its Flamborough operation.
Ontario's Ministry of the Environment has ordered the Westover site — main pumping station for the company's controversial
Line 9B — to obtain permits for air emissions and stormwater discharge, a procedure Enbridge says it has already started.
"These environmental compliance approvals are needed to ensure the materials are stored and used in a way that is
environmentally responsible that meets ministry standards and does not adversely impact the surrounding community or
environment," the ministry said in a statement.
Enbridge says it is regulated by the National Energy Board and that federal rules on emissions and discharges are the ones
that do apply, and the company is already in compliance.
‘Enbridge wants to send a very dangerous substance through a 38­year­old pipeline.’
Sabrina Bowman, Environmental Defence Canada
But if recent, heightened public interest in Enbridge has caused the ministry to impose another layer of regulations at the
Hamilton site, that's fine with the company, said spokesperson Ken Hall.
"We already have in place environmental control systems dictated by the National Energy Board," Hall said. "These
(Ontario's) aren't any different."
He noted Enbridge was not asked to comply with provincial regulations until March. That's approximately when public interest
in the Line 9B proposal began to intensify.
"I think the MOE is responding ... to try to alleviate the concerns of Ontarians," Hall said, referring to protests over Enbridge's
plan to reverse the flow and increase the pressure of oil in an 830­kilometre pipeline that runs from Westover to Montreal.
The ministry did not provide comment Tuesday on why Enbridge was not previously asked to comply with Ontario air
emission and discharge regulations at Westover.
 A group of municipalities, including Hamilton, and a number of environmental organizations and individuals, are petitioning
the province to hold an environmental assessment hearing on the proposal. It would increase the pipeline's oil capacity from
240,000 to 300,000 barrels a day and allow the transportation of heavy crude.
Right now, the only public body examining the plan is the National Energy Board (NEB), which originally expected to hold a
hearing this summer.
But requests to participate were overwhelming and the NEB pushed the hearing date back to this fall, a spokesperson for the
federal regulator said. Correspondence from groups and individuals requesting status at the hearings includes concerns
about Enbridge's safety record, the risk from a spill to huge areas of environmentally sensitive wetlands, and the
effectiveness of public safety protocols in the event of an emergency.
            Slide 1                                                          Slides
Environmentalists say there's particular concern over the line carrying diluted bitumen, a thick, molasses­type mix from the
Alberta oilsands.
"Enbridge wants to send a very dangerous substance through a 38­year­old pipeline," said Sabrina Bowman of
Environmental Defence Canada. "That line would normally carry light and medium crude, the higher quality levels of crude oil.
Bitumen is a much heavier class and its mix with condensate makes it corrosive."
Hall said the Obama administration commissioned the National Academy of Sciences in the U.S. to study the safety of diluted
bitumen after Enbridge's cataclysmic spill into the Kalamazoo River near Marshall, Michigan in 2010. He said the academy
recently released their report, showing "there are no facts to support a statement that diluted bitumen is more dangerous
within a pipeline environment."
But to city officials in Hamilton, part of a caucus of Line 9B municipalities led by Toronto, there are too many unanswered
questions. Enbridge did not answer several dozen queries submitted by the group, calling some questions "fishing
expeditions" and responding that others are outside the scope of the upcoming NEB hearing.
Guy Paparella said the communities wanted straightforward information on things such as how Enbridge plans to prevent
spills and respond to emergencies.
"If something happens, we want to know who's going to pick up the pieces," said Paparella, who is leading the City of
Hamilton's participation.
The cleanup costs from the Michigan oil spill have hit close to $1 billion and remediation is ongoing. More than 20,000 barrels
(843,000 gallons) of heavy Canadian crude gushed into the Kalamazoo River system, the largest onshore oil spill in U.S.
history. The line carried about 230,000 barrels a day to Sarnia from Griffith, Indiana.
"We do not feel a repeat of Marshall is possible because of the changes we've made since Marshall. We've learned a great
deal from that event and it's behind us," Hall said.
 "Enbridge would not undertake a project if we did not feel we could do so safely."

Copetown to Westover: Pipeline Observations by Louisette Lanteigne
On August 4, 2016 I drove to Copetown Ontario in Hamilton to witness pipelines
in the area of Line 10 to understand the geology, the land uses around it and the
maintenance of signs and above ground features related to pipelines.
The area I examined is the route of various high pressure oil pipelines like Line
7, Line 10 and 11 as well as high pressure gas lines owned by Trans Canada sharing
the same Right of Way in places.
The signs I observed did not mention terms like Line 7, Line 10 or Line 11 but it
did refer to terms such as Sarnia Products Pipeline and Enbridge.
Photo 1: This is located off Governors Road just west of the intersection with HWY
52 along the Hydro Corridor. First off, the geology of the area is hummocky rolling
hills characteristic of Paris Galt Moraine System.
At this point as seen in the photo, there is a high pressure oil pipeline with
signage identifying “Sarnia Products Pipeline” as the company responsible for this
pipe. The oil line is extremely close to two TransCanada high pressure natural gas
lines. The three metallic boxes as photographed are all located within a 5-6 foot
width. They are extremely close together.
                                                                             1
 Photo 2: There was another high pressure gas line just meters away from pipelines
shown in Photo 1. This is all within the same Hydro Corridor along Governors Road.
In this photo it shows wires and nuts exposed. There is no cap to be found near
this device. I called the Ontario Spills Action Centre about this and they helped
to connect me to an agency who could remedy this situation. My report is filed with
the MOE case file 0864-ACHLEQ.
                                                                             2
 Photo 3: Phragmites are an invasive plant that are showing up in wetlands and
roadside ditches throughout Ontario. Photo 3 shows what signage areas looked like
when I arrived to the Hydro Corridor by Governors Road. This area sits directly
across the street from where I observed the gas and oil lines. (North side of the
street) The depth of the plant coverage extended about 8 feet in front of the
sign. Making it impossible to view without manually displacing the grasses.
Photo 4: This is what the same sign looked like after I pushed aside the grass.
                                                                             3
 Photo 5: Directly behind the high pressure oil pipeline sign with the Phragmites,
off Governor's Road, you can see the farmer is growing corn over top the pipeline.
In most of my observations of pipes crossing farm fields, farmers were actively
growing corn, soy and hay in this area.
                                                                             4
 Photo 6: I drove north to Concession No.2 West, near a sign marked 1423 and
observed a man made pond placed in close proximity to a high pressure oil pipeline.
Photo 7: 1454 Concession No.2 West has a very large tree in close proximity to a
high pressure oil pipeline.
                                                                             5
 Photo 8: I saw this box on the ground marked Corrosion Services and it appears
there is some sort of testing taking place in proximity to the big tree shown in
Photo 7.
Photo 9 shows the relation of this device to the tree.
                                                                             6
 Photo 10 On August 5th, 2016 I was looking at the details of Photo 8 at home in
Waterloo to take a closer look on the writing on this black box and that is when I
noticed the connectors were not actually plugged in right. I zoomed up Photo 8 to
see this detail. You can see the connector going into the red port is not properly
fitted and you can see wires exposed on the plug going to the black port. The plug
in the red port has a light metallic screws and the other plug appears to have a
black screw. It might be due to lighting or someone may have altered the wires of
this device. It doesn't look in good shape. If I plugged in my speakers like this
it wouldn't work. What is the point of leaving the box here if there is no actual
monitoring happening here?
Photo 11: This is the detailed shot of Photo 8 looking at the words on the testing
device featured in Photo 8.
                                                                              7
 Photo 10: By marker 1432 on Hwy 5 I observed soy crops over pipes and here you can
see Enbridge's name on the sign. The corrosion as seen in the metal features above
ground makes me wonder what the situation is like under ground.
                                                                             8
 Photo 11: Missing Signs were observed along the route between Copetown to Westover.
Photo 12. Which came first the pipeline or the fencepost? I saw this on Concession
5 near lot 1490. The entire length of fence appears to have been built on top or
very near that gas line.
                                                                             9
 Photo 11: Off Hwy 5 near marker 1442 I observed a farmer cutting hay over the
pipeline using a tractor. The dust generated by the process is clearly moving
sediment. Rain, dry spells and wind can lead to erosion and thinning of the
sediments over the pipes. Driving heavy equipment can compact the dirt.
Questions I have from this:
When farmers till the soil how close do they get to the line?
Is there a weight limit for vehicles traveling above pipelines?
Are there vibrations created by Highway traffic and tractors over these pipelines?
Are there salt mitigation strategies being used to protect the pipes from road
salt?
                                                                             10
                                 The Pumping Station
Photo 12: I observed a pumping station off HWY 8 and took photographs through the
chain link fence with my cell phone to illustrate the fact these pipelines are
still using manual valves.
                                                                             11
 There is a chain holding the wheel. Anyone with the skill sets to steal a bike
could figure out how to breech both the fence and the chain using a simple device
that can be purchased for about $30 at any hardware store.
I did not see any generators or electrical plugs in this area nor did I see any
lights, water or security systems such as electronic surveillance or video cameras.
I did not see any first aid kits or fire extinguishers or fire hydrants in the
area. I did not see any sort of communications system set up. The system as it
appeared to me is, strictly for the purpose of providing a manual valve to close
the pipeline without regard for worker safety or outside communications. There is
no recording device to monitor any activity that takes place at this site.
In my view this device should be inside a building with proper electronic security
mechanisms in place including communications systems, automated valves and working
emergency generators.
                                                                             12

and the Kerrobert terminal in Saskatchewan. This pipeline was placed into service on July 1, 2010.
The Fund owns Class A Units in Southern Lights Holdings, L.L.C., which indirectly owns the U.S. segment of the
Southern Lights Pipeline. The Class A Units are non­voting and do not confer any governance rights or ownership rights in
the Southern Lights Pipeline. They entitle the Fund to receive scheduled and fixed quarterly distributions until June 30,
2040 in priority to the holder of Class B Units, comprising a return on and of capital. The distributions represent the equity
cash flows attributable to the core rate base pursuant to the terms of the current transportation service agreements for the
Southern Lights Pipeline. The Fund has the right to extend the term of the investment beyond June 30, 2040 for two
consecutive additional 10­year terms and has the right to participate in up to 100% of the equity returns from future
capacity expansions, if any, on the Southern Lights Pipeline for a term of 30 years commencing on the in­service date of
such expansion through the purchase of additional units.

Saskatchewan System
The Saskatchewan System is ideally positioned to capture oil production in the highly prolific Bakken region that spans
Saskatchewan, North Dakota and Montana. The Bakken region has quickly grown to become one of the leading oil
producing regions in North America.
Production from the Bakken Formation in North Dakota alone has grown from 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 700,000
bpd. Recent projections estimate that production could reach 1.2 million bpd or more by 2018.
The Saskatchewan System is comprised of crude oil and liquids pipeline systems that connect producing fields with
Enbridge Inc.’s mainline pipeline to the United States;
The Fund’s crude oil and liquids pipeline systems in Saskatchewan are comprised of:
            The Saskatchewan Gathering System;
            the Westspur System;
            the Weyburn System; and the
            Bakken Expansion Pipeline
Collectively, these crude oil and liquids pipeline systems comprise approximately 545 kilometres of trunk line and 1,800
kilometres of crude oil and liquids gathering system pipeline. The Fund’s Saskatchewan System also includes storage
facilities in Saskatchewan, consisting of 21 storage tanks with a combined capacity of ~450,000 barrels and related
terminals.
Saskatchewan Gathering System
Located in southeastern Saskatchewan, the Saskatchewan Gathering System transports crude oil from producing fields to
the Westspur System through about 1,600 kilometres of gathering lines, ranging from three to 10 inches in diameter. The
systems capacity is approximately 255,000 barrels of oil per day. It has seven storage tanks with a combined capacity of
59,000 barrels.
 Westspur System
Located in southeastern Saskatchewan, the Westspur System is a trunk line system. It transports crude oil received from
gathering systems and truck shipments, and natural gas liquids from the gas processing facility at Steelman,
Saskatchewan. The products are transported via the Westspur System to Cromer, Manitoba, and from there to eastern
Canada and the United States via connecting pipeline systems, including the Mainline System.
The Westspur System consists of about 390 kilometres of 12­ and 16­inch trunk line and approximately 80 kilometres of
gathering lines ranging from four to eight inches in diameter. The capacity of the Westspur System is approximately
255,000 bpd.It has four pumping stations near Midale, Steelman, Bryant and Alida, Saskatchewan, with a total of 10
storage tanks and a combined capacity of 360,000 barrels.
Weyburn System
The Weyburn System is a gathering system located immediately west of the Westspur System at Weyburn,
Saskatchewan. It delivers crude oil from producing fields to the Westspur Midale pumping station and consists of about 85
kilometres of gathering lines ranging from three to 12 inches in diameter, and two storage tanks with a combined capacity
of 30,000 barrels. The capacity of the Weyburn System is approximately 47,000 bpd.
System Expansion
Since 2006, the Fund has completed two major system expansions in response to increased throughput and demand for
capacity on the Saskatchewan System. Phase I increased capacity on the Westspur and Weyburn pipelines by 34%.
Completed in 2010, Phase II increased the crude oil capacity across the Saskatchewan System by an additional 125,000
bpd.
Bakken Expansion Pipeline
In March 2013, the Bakken Expansion Pipeline (BEP) went into service. A joint venture with Enbridge Energy
Partners, BEP enables delivery of growing crude oil production in North Dakota to the Mainline System at Cromer,
Manitoba. BEP increased takeaway capacity from the Bakken region by 145,000 bpd and is predominantly underwritten by
take­or­pay contracts.
                                                                                                                  Back to top
Hardisty Contract Terminals & Storage Caverns
As of September 1, 2015, the Fund took ownership of three recently renewed storage contracts at the Hardisty Contract
Terminal. As part of this transaction, Enbridge released its expansion rights for the terminal and associated storage
caverns, located in Hardisty, Alberta.
The Fund owns one of the largest contract crude oil storage facilities in North America, consisting of:
Hardisty Contract Terminals: 18 above­ground crude oil tanks and one above ground condensate tank representing
approximately 7.5 million barrels of storage capacity, adjacent to the Mainline System operational terminal and at the
junction of key regional receipt and export pipelines.
Hardisty Storage Caverns: four below­ground storage caverns and two above­ground buffer tanks, representing
approximately 3.5 million barrels of storage capacity, adjacent to the Hardisty Contract Terminals.
All 11 million barrels of crude oil storage capacity is contracted under long­term take­or­pay agreements with credit­worthy
counterparties. As of Sept 2015, the contracts had an average remaining term of approximately 7 years.

   Enbridge Pipelines Inc.
   Line 10 Westover Segment Replacement Project
   Section 1 Executive Summary
 1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
 2 1.1.         The Applicant
 3 Enbridge is a body corporate, incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations Act 1and
 4 is a “company” within the meaning of the NEB Act 2. Enbridge is the owner and operator of the
 5 Canadian portion of the Enbridge Mainline System, which is a common carriage system that
 6 transports crude oil and petroleum products from the hub at Edmonton, Alberta to locations
 7 throughout Canada and to the Canada/United States border.
 8 1.2.         Project Overview
 9 Enbridge is proposing the Project in order to replace approximately 32 kilometres (“km”) of
10 existing 12-inch-diameter pipe with approximately 35 km of new 20-inch diameter pipe, between
11 Enbridge’s Westover Terminal and its Nanticoke Junction facility. This segment replacement
12 approach will minimize disruption to both landowners and the environment by substantially
13 reducing the number of necessary preventative maintenance digs and repairs that would
14 otherwise be required to maintain the existing pipeline. Additionally, upon completion, this
15 segment of pipe will be more hydraulically efficient; replacing the current 12 inch pipe with 20
16 inch pipe aligns this segment with the remainder of the 20 inch Line 10 pipeline, thereby
17 allowing the transportation of product while using less energy.
18 The overall Project includes the following:
19              •    The replacement of approximately 35 km of the existing 323.9 millimeter (“mm”)
20                   O.D. (NPS 12) pipe with 508 mm O.D. (NPS 20) pipe;
21              •    The addition of 4 remotely operated sectionalizing valves (“RSV”) along the
22                   replacement Line 10 pipeline;
23              •    The addition of one new pig launching trap and one associated leak detection
24                   meter; and
25              •    The decommissioning in place of approximately 32 km of the existing NPS 12
26                   Line 10 pipeline.
27 Enbridge’s goal is to align the route of the new replacement pipe segment adjacent to the
28 existing Enbridge pipeline right of way (“ROW”). Additional permanent ROW of approximately
29 10 m in width is expected to be required, most of which is alongside the existing ROW, and will
30 be acquired through the execution of Easement Agreements with landowners. The Project
31 includes three proposed reroutes in order to avoid golf courses, rural residences, and a
32 residental subdivision, totaling approximately 11 km.

   Line 10 Westover Segment Replacement Project
   Section 1 Executive Summary
 1 Subject to the receipt of regulatory approval, construction on the Project is expected to begin no
 2 later than the third quarter of 2017. Construction is expected to take less than one year, with an
 3 expected in-service date in the first quarter of 2018. Restoration of the ROW is planned to
 4 follow upon completion of construction activities.
 5 1.3.         Project Purpose
 6 The Project is a routine maintenance project that, upon completion, will restore this segment of
 7 Line 10 to its original operating capacity of approximately 74,200 bpd. In recent years, this
 8 segment has experienced an increasing number of preventative maintenance digs to inspect
 9 and repair the line and has reached Enbridge’s conservative threshold for replacement.
10 1.4.         Action Sought by Applicant
11 Enbridge hereby makes an application pursuant to Section 58 of the NEB Act for approval to
12 construct and operate this Line 10 segment replacement pipeline, and pursuant to Section 45.1
13 of the OPR to decommission the existing section of the Line 10 pipeline that is being replaced.
14 Enbridge respectfully requests the following relief:
15              a) An order, pursuant to section 58 of the NEB Act, exempting the Project from the
16                   provisions of paragraph 30(1)(b), and sections 31, 33 and 47 of the NEB Act;
17              b) An order, pursuant to section 45.1 of the OPR, allowing Enbridge to
18                   decommission the identified portions of the pipeline in accordance with the
19                   methodology set out in this application; and
20              c) Such further and other relief as Enbridge may request or the Board may deem
21                   appropriate pursuant to section 20 of the NEB Act.
22 1.5.         Non-NEB Regulatory Approvals
23 All non-NEB regulatory approvals required for the Project will be secured as required.

             Jefferson Salamander (Ambystoma jeffersonianum )
Current Designations:
GRANK – G4 Dec. 28, 2001
NRANK Canada – N2 Sept. 27 1998
COSEWIC -- Endangered Nov. 2010
SARA – Threatened Schedule 1
General Status Canada – At Risk
ESA 2007 – Threatened
SRANK –S2
General Status Ontario – At Risk
Distribution and Status Outside Ontario:
The distribution of A. jeffersonianum is limited to eastern North America, from New York
and New England southwest to Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky and Indiana (Petranka
1998, Bogart and Klemens 1997, 2008). Isolated populations have been recorded in
east-central Illinois (Petranka 1998, Mullen and Klueh 2009). For much of this range,
genetic data are not available so the continental distribution of pure A. jeffersonianum
and unisexuals that use A. jeffersonianum as a sperm donor is uncertain (Bogart and
Klemens 2008). In Canada, Jefferson Salamander occurs only in southern Ontario.
The core of the range of pure A. jeffersonianum populations likely extends from
Pennsylvania southwestward to Kentucky. The jeffersonianum genome is widely
distributed in eastern North America but exists primarily in polyploidy unisexuals (Bogart
and Klemens 1997). Individuals that have solely the A. jeffersonianum genome occur in
many “hybridized” populations.
                                  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
                                              2
 Native Status
Yes. Ambystoma jeffersonianum, has been known to exist in Canada only since 1976
when a population was discovered in southern Ontario (Weller and Sprules 1976). It has
clearly been here much longer.
Taxonomic Distinctness
Yes. Jefferson Salamander (Ambystoma jeffersonianum) was first described by Green
in 1827 (in Uzzell 1967). Since then there has been considerable confusion about the
species’ taxonomy because of the sympatric occurrence of polyploid, all-female
unisexual populations of Ambystoma salamanders that use sperm from male Jefferson
Salamanders in reproduction. Since the last report (COSSARO 2000), there has been
significant new scientific information that allows more accurate and precise estimates of
numbers and distribution of Jefferson Salamanders in Ontario (COSEWIC 2010, in
press). This new information clarifies further the relationship between Jefferson
Salamander (JJ) and sympatric populations of all female unisexual Ambystoma (LJJ)
salamanders.
Designatable Units
There is no evidence of major genetic differences in A. jeffersonianum in Canada, no
significant natural disjunction and all populations occur in the same ecoregion.
Therefore, the species is considered a single Designatable Unit. It is possible that an
assessment should be conducted on the unisexuals. They may constitute a separate
DU but it would not be a Jefferson Salamander DU, because the unisexuals share
genomes with other ambystomids.
                               PRIORITY-SETTING CRITERIA
Recent Arrival
No. Although first reported in Canada by Weller and Sprules in 1976, it has
undoubtedly been present here for at least hundreds of years (Zammit and Oldham
2000).
Non-resident
No.
                        PRIMARY CRITERIA (rarity and declines)
1. Global Rank
Not in any category. It is a G4 as assessed by NatureServe in 2001 (NatureServe
2011). However, given the taxonomic confusion and lack of investigation to accurately
identify the species from unisexuals and similar ambystomid species, Jefferson
Salamanders may be less common than the NatureServe rank suggests.
2. Global Decline
                                               3
 Insufficient Information. There are few trend data available, and no suggestion of a
widespread decline, but problems with identification without genetic data give this
assessment a high degree of uncertainty.
3. Northeastern North America Ranks
Special Concern. It occurs in 15 of 28 northeastern North American jurisdictions and
SRank or equivalent information is available for 14 of 15 jurisdictions = 93%. Classified
as S1, S2, SH, or SX in 5 of 14 = 36% (Table 1).
4. Northeastern North America Decline
Insufficient Information. There is insufficient information to assess trends across the
species’ range.
5. Ontario Occurrences
Special Concern. COSEWIC recognizes 33 extant locations (COSEWIC 2010 in
press), while the Ontario NHIC database identifies 46 EOs (NHIC 2011). Both sources
support a Special Concern status for this criterion (20-50 occurrences)
6. Ontario Decline
Threatened. Of 87 sites from which salamanders of the Jeffersonianum complex have
been recorded, only 33 have been confirmed to have A. jeffersonianum (JJ) or
unisexuals (LJJ) over the past decade. Assuming all 33 locations have pure Jefferson
Salamanders (JJ), then the decline over the past three generations (~33 years) is 60%.
However, other samples from ponds known to have pure Jefferson Salamanders
suggest the decline is higher (COSEWIC 2010 in press). Repeat surveys over a 15-
year timeframe (1990-2005) revealed that most populations were declining and some
were extirpated. For example, surveys of 18 historically known breeding sites along the
Niagara Escarpment that were documented in 1990-91 revealed only 3 sites that were
confirmed to still be supporting A. jeffersonianum populations in 2003-04 (COSEWIC
2010, in press), an apparent decline of 83%.
7. Ontario’s Conservation Responsibility
Not in any category. Ontario has less than 10% of global range, albeit the most
interesting 10%.
                   SECONDARY CRITERIA (threats and vulnerability)
1. Population Sustainability
Endangered. The rapid decline in distribution and abundance in the past 30 years
appears to be caused by loss of habitat (COSEWIC 2010 in press) and by the
increasing impact of the kleptogenic unisexuals. This threat is the so-called “Clanton
effect”, a term coined by Minton (1954), that would result in a population crash of both
A. jeffersonianum and unisexuals because there would no longer be any
spermatophores. The reason for this loss of spermatophores is that as the unisexuals
increase they would take more and more spermatophores leading to a decline in
                                              4
 reproductive success of Jefferson females. The Clanton effect has not been
documented in any population; however there is current research to test this hypothesis
(JP Bogart pers. comm. August 2010). If male A. jeffersonianum are extirpated, the
unisexual population crashes unless they can use another species as a sperm donor. It
is also interesting to realize that unisexuals can only successfully immigrate to ponds
that already have acceptable sperm donors.
2. Lack of Regulatory Protection for Exploited Wild Populations
Not in any category. There is no known harvest in Ontario. The species is protected
under the Endangered Species Act, 2007.
3. Direct Threats
Endangered. The loss, alteration and increasing isolation of breeding ponds and their
surrounding deciduous forest habitat is a major set of direct threats. The species
occupies areas under intense development pressure from urbanization, road
proliferation, aggregate extraction and drainage for agriculture and other activities. The
species has an affinity for upland deciduous forests, and requires vernal (temporary),
fishless ponds for breeding and are extremely philopatric. These breeding ponds
become unsuitable if their hydrology changes (e. g. dry out too quickly) or if predatory
fish are introduced. Migration to and from breeding ponds can be disrupted by
roadways, silt fencing, drainage ditches, plantations, or other barriers (COSEWIC
2010). Clearing ponds or surrounding habitat of woody debris can also destroy
salamander habitat. Even though much of the species’ Ontario range is protected under
the Niagara Escarpment Act, the Green Belt, the Canadian Species at Risk Act (SARA),
not to mention the Ontario Endangered Species Act of 2007, ponds continue to be lost
to anthropogenic activities. Another direct threat is from the Ambystoma unisexuals.
These can increase to greatly outnumber pure Jefferson Salamanders and deprive the
Jefferson females of sperm to fertilize their eggs. This outcome leads to the extirpation
of Jefferson’s from the breeding pond, and ultimately, could also lead to extirpation of
the unisexuals if no other ambystomatid salamanders are present.
4. Specialized Life History or Habitat-use Characteristics
Endangered. Jefferson Salamanders require temporary, fishless ponds to breed and an
extensive surrounding moist deciduous forest for other activities. This life history is not
particularly specialized except in the context of the species being found almost entirely
in areas currently under intense development pressure. In this ecological context, the
species is highly vulnerable given its specialized needs and limited dispersal capacities.
Unlike many other pond breeding amphibians, Jefferson Salamanders have an
extended lifespan and late maturity and are vulnerable to increased adult mortality
which occurs with increased anthropogenic disturbance and presence of roads or other
features that must be crossed on breeding migrations. (COSEWIC 2010).

                                          SUMMARY
Jefferson Salamander (Ambystoma jeffersonianum) is Endangered in Ontario because
of recent and ongoing declines in population. Since the 2000 status report, our
knowledge of the abundance and distribution of Jefferson Salamander has changed and
the risk of extinction in this species has increased. Molecular genetic analysis of tissue
samples allows identification of individuals and has generated more accurate and
precise estimates of numbers and distribution. The new data clarify the relationship
between Jefferson Salamander (JJ) and sympatric populations of all female unisexual
Ambystoma (LJJ) salamander. In Ontario, all populations of A. jeffersonianum (JJ) also
contain unisexual Ambystoma (LJJ). Ambystoma jeffersonianum has not been found in
all populations containing LJJ unisexuals, but it is presumed that A. jeffersonianum is or
was also present as a sperm donor. Of 87 sites known to have JJ or LJJ salamanders,
only about one third still have extant populations of Jefferson Salamanders (JJ), many
have fewer individuals of Jefferson Salamanders than originally thought. Unisexual LJJ
females outnumber Jefferson females, often by a wide margin. The absolute number
and proportion of JJ to LJJ have declined in virtually all ponds where repeated tissue
samples have conclusively identified JJ from unisexual LJJ. Threats to the survival of
the species include loss of ponds and terrestrial habitat to development, fragmentation
of locations by roads and uninhabitable terrain. These changes also can affect local
hydrology and the impact on the salamanders is amplified by introduction of predatory
fish into ponds. These salamanders can live a long time (~30 years), making them very
vulnerable to threats associated with development.

                      Ontario Evaluation Using COSEWIC Criteria
                   Regional (Ontario) COSEWIC Criteria Assessment
Criterion A – Decline in Total Number of Mature Individuals
ENDANGERED. Meets Endangered under A2bc+4bc as the total number of mature
individuals has declined by more than 50% over the past 33 years. The decline has not
ceased and may not be reversible. The decline is likely to continue at a similar rate or
perhaps accelerate as potentially negative effects of the unisexuals increases. The
decline is based on an appropriate index (number of locations) of abundance
(subcriterion b) and a decline in IAO, EO and habitat quality (subcriterion c).
Criterion B – Small Distribution Range and Decline or Fluctuation
ENDANGERED. Meets Endangered under B2ab(i,ii,iii,iv,v) as the IAO (196 km²) is
lower than the Endangered threshold, the species habitat is estimated to be severely
fragmented, and there is an observed and inferred continuing decline in b(i,ii,iii,iv,v).
Criterion C – Small and Declining Number of Mature Individuals
Not applicable. Not applicable as the total number of mature individuals is unknown.
Criterion D – Very Small or Restricted Total Population
Not applicable.
Criterion E – Quantitative Analysis
Not applicable.
                                      Rescue Effect
No. It is highly improbable that there could be rescue from USA populations because
the species is a poor disperser. The closest U.S. populations of A. jeffersonianum to
Ontario populations are in Cattaraugus and Wayne counties in New York where
unisexual LJJ are also found (Bogart and Klemens 2008). Considering the limited
movements in this species, current distribution, and barriers to dispersal, rescue from
the U.S. is highly improbable

RE: Enbridge Pipelines Inc. ­ Line 10 Westover Segment Replacement Project ­ Proposed Electrical Transmission Corridor Route (A79406)
Background:
This email regards an ongoing National Energy Board Process known as Line 10 Westover Segment Replacement which is basically the
abandonment of an old pipeline with the installation of a new parallel oil pipeline to deliver fuels from Nanticoke Junction Facility in
Hamilton to Enbridge's Westover Terminal. It is part of a 142 Km export pipeline that carries oil from Westover to West Seneca in Buffalo
NY where it attaches to the Kiantone Pipeline in Warren Pennsylvania where it is refined.
Previously I was a participant of both Enbridge Line 9 NEB processes where I secured new conditions to add more valves along Line 9's
major waterways. When I applied for the Enbridge Line 10 hearing, the NEB denied me the right to participate at all. I appealed by way of
a written letter and the NEB then allowed me to be a commenter without any explanation as to why they specifically limited my
participation. I have expertise specific to these properties because I previously initiated and Environmental Bill of Rights Review which
resulted in a full review on the state of the Waterloo and Paris Galt Moraine systems. My work is currently archived at Wilfrid Laurier for
the advocacy I have done over many years. I have successfully protect moraines and Jefferson Salamanders using various public
processes.
I was given a firm deadline for my written submission. The NEB deadline was Friday August 19th. A screen shot of the informational
power point along with the email from NEB Process Advisor Matt Groza Is included in the attachments for your reference. My affidavit as
submitted on August 15th 2015 focused on the lack of critical habitat delineation for the Endangered Jefferson salamander as well as
significant geological/seismic risks and concerns with the use of brand names rather than legal corporate names when identifying the
owner of this pipeline. I was concerned of potential fraud. You can view my full affidavit which is NEB file A78981 online here:
 https://docs.neb­one.gc.ca/ll­eng/llisapi.dll?func=ll&objId=3025064&objAction=browse&viewType=1
On September 14, 2016 Enbridge filed new information showing they were relocating the area of the proposed new pipeline. See NEB
File A79406 online here;
https://docs.neb­one.gc.ca/ll­eng/llisapi.dll?func=ll&objId=3052327&objAction=browse
Within the new information is document A79406­8 titled: Updated ESA Reroute A5F0W7 Line 10 Westover Segment Replacement
Project Prepared for Enbridge by CH2M Hill and Dillion Consulting LImited (There is a PDF copy of this document in the attachments and
I will refer to the page number of the PDF below for your reference)
Please review the following passages as taken from this report:
3.1.2 Consultation with Other Stakeholders (Page 6 PDF)
3.1.2 Consultation with Other Stakeholders Enbridge has notified the Grand River Conservation Authority and the City of Hamilton of the
route being considered via email in August 2016, and have requested their feedback. Additionally, Enbridge has spoken with the Ontario
Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) on August 19, 2016 regarding the ETCR and the potential effects on various species,
including Jefferson salamander (Ambystoma jeffersonianum), common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina) and American chestnut
(Castanea dentate). MNRF indicated that the Project design, construction methodology and construction timing windows described are
acceptable provided appropriate mitigation measures are implemented. Specific survey requirements regarding Jefferson salamander
discussed with MNRF include pond suitability studies to be completed in 2017 to determine potential habitat and presence of Jefferson
salamander. Mitigation measures to be implemented in confirmed habitat will include amphibian salvage or relocation, and the installation
of exclusion fencing prior to construction. The Project­specific preliminary Environmental Protection Plan (EPP) will be updated as
warranted, including the wildlife Resource Specific Mitigation Table (RSMT) included as Table 3 in Appendix O [Filing ID A5D8Y1]. In
discussion with MNRF, it was determined that future turtle basking surveys along the ETCR are not warranted given that habitat is
considered to be significant turtle habitat (MNRF, 2000; MNRF, 2015) based on August 2016 field observations, and that mitigation
measures remain the same as what was included in the EPP [Filing ID A5D8Y1]. Mitigation measures specific to American chestnut were
not discussed at this time; however, Enbridge will consult with MNRF upon completion of field surveys in order to determine any site or
species­specific mitigation, if observed during field studies. Additional details and updates are provided in the Stakeholder Consultation
Section of this filing.
Table 4­1. Summary of Environmental and Socio­Economic Setting and Considerations (page 10 PDF)
Wildlife
• Jefferson salamander (Ambystoma jeffersonianum) is known to occur in proximity to the ETCR. This habitat has been previously
described in Section 5.0 of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2R0] and the Supplemental ESA [Filing ID A5E4Z2]. Potential effects to Jefferson
salamander have been previously assessed in Sections 6.2.11 and 7.10 of the ESA [Filing ID A4W2R0 and A4W2R6] and reviewed in
consideration of the route revisions filed in the Supplemental ESA [Filing ID A5E4Z2]. Considering the ETCR, updates to the Wildlife
RSMT and the Project EAS will be warranted following habitat suitability studies in spring and summer 2017. Surveys will be completed in
consultation with the MNRF.
 5.1 Supplemental Studies (page 12 of PDF)
• Amphibian breeding surveys are scheduled to occur between April and June 2017 in areas where potential habitat has been identified.
Jefferson salamander pond suitability studies will occur in spring and summer 2017 in select areas along the ETCR.
The issues I have specific to the above mentioned comments are as follows:
1. This timing for the Jefferson Salamander tests as noted by Enbridge conflicts with the common book used as the key guide for
salamander surveys: Heyer, W.R., M.A. Donnelly, R.W. McDiarmid, L.C. Hayek, and M.S. Foster, (editors). 1994 Measuring and
Monitoring Biological Diversity: Standard Methods for Amphibians, Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington, DC. 364 pp.
Basicallly, Jefferson salamanders migrate to ponds during the first warm rains of spring when temperatures are 4 °C or higher. They are
unique in this time range compared to other species giving them the advantage of less predation. They breed, lay eggs and migrate back
into the forests well before other species arrive to the pond.
2. A cursory review of the weather data for Hamilton for 2016 as seen in the attachments, indicates that the conditions during March were
likely very suitable for the breeding migration of the Jefferson salamander because of the air temperatures on this date were frequently
>10ºC. Thus, the statement that the amphibian surveys are to be completed during April in regards to Line 10, indicates the primary
breeding migration would not be observed and conflicts with standard methods used to inventory amphibians in general and salamanders
in particular (Heyer et al. 1994). For example, the amphibian surveys completed for habitats in southern Ontario (Hecnar and M’Closkey
1996, 1998) that are being used currently to frame conservation plans for amphibians used early spring sampling to determine species
inventories at sites.
3. Currently the Ontario MNR states Jefferson salamander (and hybrids) samples shall be limited to toe or tail clips (maximum 5mm)
and/or egg mass collections (2­5 eggs per egg mass).however testing on eggs is the destruction of a specimen. It is important to note that
The Wildlife Scientific Collector's Authorization process with the Province of Ontario allows for the capture of wildlife, keeping of wildlife
and release of wildlife, not the destruction of actual specimens. If testing takes place in April and June it will not likely focus on DNA tests
conducted on mature salamanders but will involve the destruction of eggs and/or larvae of this endangered species.
4. In the attachment is a letter from Ecojustice clarifying the specific policies that protect Jefferson salamanders in Ontario..
5. Because the Jefferson salamander has been observed to achieve the age of 30 years in undisturbed forests of southern Ontario (Dr.
Nicholas Collins, University of Toronto, Erindale Campus Mississauga, Ont, Pers. Comm.), a relevant question to ask is: why might this
salamander be identified as absent in an intact forest along Line 10 while other salamander species are still present and abundant at the
site? There apparently are no issues of species scarcity with other variants of mole salamanders like spotted.salamanders in Ontario to
warrant their inclusion on the endangered species list yet they often share the same pond as Jefferson Salamanders. Why is it that just
this one species is missing?
6. In my sworn affidavit submitted for the Line 10 process, it included Attachment 4, a document produced by The Committee on the
Status of Specie At Risk In Ontario (COSSARO) which speaks of the swift decline in Jefferson Salamander populations. It states the
following:
       6. Ontario Decline
       Threatened. Of 87 sites from which salamanders of the Jeffersonianum complex have been recorded, only 33 have been
       confirmed to have A. jeffersonianum (JJ) or unisexuals (LJJ) over the past decade. Assuming all 33 locations have pure
       Jefferson Salamanders (JJ), then the decline over the past three generations (~33 years) is 60%. However, other samples
       from ponds known to have pure Jefferson Salamanders suggest the decline is higher (COSEWIC 2010 in press). Repeat
       surveys over a 15­year timeframe (1990­2005) revealed that most populations were declining and some were extirpated.
       For example, surveys of 18 historically known breeding sites along the Niagara Escarpment that were documented in 1990­
       91 revealed only 3 sites that were confirmed to still be supporting A. jeffersonianum populations in 2003­04 (COSEWIC
       2010, in press), an apparent decline of 83%.
       7. Ontario’s Conservation Responsibility
       Not in any category. Ontario has less than 10% of global range, albeit the most interesting 10%.
7. There is no reasonable explanation as to what the COSSARO report is referring to in section 7. Why does Ontario has an "Interesting"
Jefferson Salamander population?
8. Is there a link between Ontario's population decline of Jefferson salamanders and the way Environmental Impact Studies are testing for
them?
9. I have spent 16 years asking the ministry to simply secure proper test methods for this animal. It was the subject of two Part II order
requests I made with the Ministry of Environment. I initiated an Ontario Municipal Board Process PL071044 where my expert secured
concessions for this animal. We made all sides sign off on the fact testing was insufficient. The MNR representative from Guelph who
witnessed this was Ken Cornelisse. I also saw the same issue with the Mount Nemo Quarry Pit Expansion which was stopped at the
Ontario Municipal Board. Now we have the same issue happening with Enbridge Line 10. Why is the government of Ontario not stepping
up to mandate proper testing procedures to avoid loss of specimens and to avoid having to address the issue repetitively in costly hearing
processes?
10. I would like the NEB to find out how many eggs and larvae have been destroyed to facilitate Jefferson salamander testing in regards
to the Line 10 pipeline to date. The data is recorded in the Wildlife Collectors Permit and I think both the Province, the Federal
Government and the NEB really need to review those numbers.
 11. I want to know from the Province of Ontario: How many of these animals die annually simply by testing for eggs and larvae? Can you
provide me with a written answer please?
12. What is the cumulative impacts to date for the totality of not only Line 10 Jefferson salamanders but for connecting line where oil is
intended to flow from the one pipe to the other. If we facilitate the transfer of oil by way of this approval process we need to look at the
total footprint this approval process is having on this particular species. Will approval of this line push this animal faster to extinction?
13. The Scientific merits of the Jefferson Salamander is extremely high. They are an excellent indicator species for high water quality and
high groundwater recharge areas. They are one of the few animals that regrows all body tissues including bone, skin and mussel in the
right sequence and studies are being done with salamanders to glean data on how to regrow human limbs. There are triploid varieties of
Jefferson salamanders with three chromosomes not just two and they are found here in Ontario. The knowledge to be gleaned from
triploids can give us clues on how to cure genetic diseases like Downs syndrome. This animal is literally a scientific treasure. It would be a
lost for all mankind to loose such an extraordinary species who's very DNA holds so much potential for the future of medicine.
14. In light of the above concerns, I respectfully request that the NEB mandate proper spring thaw testing for Jefferson salamanders
which includes the proper use of drop pit tests and that strictly prohibits the destruction of known specimens. I would like the NEB to apply
this to ALL pipeline EA's where Jefferson salamanders are at risk. I would like the province to apply these standards as soon as possible.
15. In order to comply with Provincial, Federal and International Biodiversity laws as written, we need critical habitat delineation and a
recovery strategy for these animals. We need to secure reasonable data and understand the full consequences of our actions before
habitat destruction and loss of specimens takes place not afterwards and that includes tree clearance and ground disturbances at these
locations.
16. I would also like to appeal to the Board to add a measure of procedural fairness for commenters that have complied with the deadlines
and were left out of the knowledge of the additional EA data and other documents which Enbridge Submitted on September 14, 2015.
17. As a Mi'kmaq Metis woman it is my duty by way of the Vatican Concordat of 1610 to be Catholic and to protect people.With today's
policies, Endangered Species are the only tool we have to protect high water recharge zones located away from wellhead areas. The
Source Water Act excludes protection for these natural recharge areas, but if we protect the salamanders, we protect our own water
supplies for generations to come. Please protect our water. Protect the wetlands because they protects our rivers and lakes by filtering out
the the nitrates and phosphates when kept salt free. The algae and salt issue plaguing wells and Lake Erie are a testimony to our
destruction of the wetlands in Southern Ontario. These habitat areas are sacred spaces that are vital to protecting our remaining
endangered species, traditional foods and medicines and water supplies. Saving the salamander, save all this.
I pray in good faith that the NEB will accept this document as an addendum to the overall evidence I submit for this process since
commentors like me were not privy to this new data provided by Enbridge prior to our Aug. 19th deadline. I pray procedural fairness will
prevail to receive this document as an addendum to help protect the public good, the endangered Jefferson salamanders and our water
supplies for the long term.
I will electronically submit this for the record.
Thank you kindly for your time. Wela'lin/ Miigwetch.

Dear Ms. Young:
RE: Hearing Order OH-001-2016 — Enbridge PipeLines Inc. (Enbridge)
Line 10 Westover Segment Replacement Project
Environment and Climate Change Canada Letter of Comment
Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) has a mandate to protect migratory
birds and species at risk (SAR), as well as water and air quality. ECCC also promotes the
conservation of wetlands. As such, ECCC is providing specialist, expert information with
regards to the Line 10 Westover Segment Replacement Project (the Project) in
accordance with the following regulatory and program responsibilities:
- Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994 (MBCA)
- Migratory Bird Regulations (MBR)
- Species at Risk Act (SARA)
- Canadian Environmental Protection Act
- Department of the Environment Act
- The Federal Policy on Wetland Conservation
ECCC has reviewed the project information submitted by the proponent, which consisted
of its Application, Environmental and Socio-Economic Assessment (ESA), Update to the
ESA. Additional Evidence and Application Update, Response to Information Requests #1,
2 and 3, and the Supplemental ESA.
This Letter of Comment serves to provide recommendations to the National Energy Board
(NEB) with the goal of minimizing the potential adverse effects of the Project on areas of
the environment relating to ECCC’s mandate.
It is our understanding that the replacement pipeline is to be placed primarily in the
existing easement, but with approximately 3 km of re—routes, some of which are as far as
1.2 km from the existing easement. It is also our understanding that much of the route is
located within an existing and disturbed pipeline right—of—way (ROW) in a fragmented
landscape in Ontario's Greenbelt Plan area. The project footprint primarily traverses
agricultural land but also includes isolated woodlots, streams and remnant natural areas
such as the SheffieId-Rockton, the Hayesland-Christie and the Big Creek Headwaters
provincially significant wetland complexes. We also understand that route selection has
not been finalized. As such, further route refinements may be warranted as a result of
C d'éi

ECCC recommends that the NEB ensure the proponent implements the following:

13. Should any Blanding’s Turtle be found in the project area in the future, ensure
construction works (including trenching or vegetation clearing) do not occur in
Blanding’s Turtle nesting habitat between 15 May and 31 October.

14. Should any American Chestnut trees be found in the project area, do not remove any
individuals or alter their habitats, and contact ECCC for further advice.

15. Should any Red-headed Woodpeckers, Eastern Whip—poor—wills or any other
migratory bird SAR listed under Schedule 1 of SARA be found in the project area,
contact ECCC by email at eefaune.nntariu-wiIdlife.ontaria.ec@canada.ca or by phone
at 905-336—4464.

Air Quality & Greenhouse Gases (GHGs)

The Project has the potential to adversely affect air quality and to emit GHGs. During the

construction phase, activities such as land clearing, burning slash (if applicable),

trenching, pipe stringing and bending, welding and coating, along with the operation of
vehicles and machinery required to carry out such activities, generate fugitive dust and
exhaust emissions. The emissions generated from such sources include: suspended
particulate matter (SPM), PM10, PM2.5, NOX, 802, CO and GHGs. The operational phase
of the project will also emit air contaminants related to fugitive dust from on and off-road
equipment, fossil fuel combustion from power generators, and from site site-specific
maintenance activities.

Other potential sources of emissions of air contaminants and GHGs wmch were not

identified by the proponent include the emissions from tank farms and fugitive emissions

(VOCs) and hydrocarbons (CH4) from leaks from seals, flanges, valves and other

connections.

The proponent has predicted the importance of air emissions, consisting of both criteria air

contaminants (CACs) and GHGs, with respect to residual effects to be negligible (Table

6.2.4—2). This prediction is made based on professional judgement of the assessment
team and based on experience with other similar pipeline projects. Similarly, for the
cumulative effects assessment, professional judgment is used to state that when the
project’s emissions are combined with background air quality, relevant criteria would not
be exceeded. ECCC would expect that a quantification of air quality and GHG emissions
be conducted in order to provide a more robust basis for applying professional judgment
with respect to their potential effects.

It should also be noted that the proponent has used outdated Federal Objectives for

PM2.5 and Ozone in Table 4-1 of Appendix 2A. The Canadian Ambient Air Quality

Standards (CAAQS) effective in 2015 should be used for PM2.5 and Ozone.

The CAAQS for the year 2015 and 2020 that the proponent should be using are indicated
in the table below.

Air Quality 3: GHG Recemmendatiens:
ECCC recommends that the proponent:

16. Provide an air quality assessment for all phases of the project (on a phase by
phase basis), as well as a cumulative effects assessment using standardized
dispersion modelling. The assessments should incorporate all major sources of
emissions, including activities related to construction and operation of the pipeline
and decommissioning of existing pipelines. The assessments should be based on a
conservative/ worst-case scenario with a focus on main pollutants of concern such
as NOx, TSP, PM10 and PM2.5, CO (for the 1-hr and 24-hr averaging periods) and
VOCs where applicable, using the proposed CAAQS for 2015 and 2020 that are
provided in the above table. The assessments should also include the identification
of any mitigation measures that might be required to reduce any adverse air quality
effects.

17. Provide an estimation of the direct GHG emissions for all phases of the project, as
well as detailed mitigation measures proposed to minimize GHGs. This information
should be based on carbon dioxide equivalent units (002 e) per year.

18. For residential communities such as Mount Hope, Copetown, and Orkney, and any
other sensitive receptors within the local study area, conduct an air quality
assessment (within 5 km of construction activities and project stations). The air
quality assessment should include figures with isopleths showing the location of
receptors relative to the project and show where maximum concentrations of
particular CACs occur (including, but not limited to 8PM, PM10 and PM2.5 and
NOx). Based on the results there may be a need for dust and NOx follow-up
monitoring during construction and decommissioning phases. Dust monitoring is
important since landowners expressed concern about dust during the proponents
consultation activities (6.2.4 page 6-41).

11

19. ECCC agrees with the proponent’s commitment to manage air emissions by
following standard mitigation and management practices as per the proposed
mitigation measures in Tables 6.2.4—1 and 625-1. However, ECCC recommends
that the proponent provide details in terms of the objectives of air quality mitigation
measures, and the efficiency of mitigation measures (used for modelling), listing the
applied methods and the conditions that trigger mitigation measures. ECCC also
recommends that the proponent incorporate record keeping of the frequency of
adopted mitigation measures and related actions.

20. Incorporate the practices from the Chemlnfo Services Inc. document: “Best
Practices for the Reduction of Air Emissions From Construction and Demolition
Activities” (referenced below) into their Best Management Plans for dust, CACs and
GHGs, as well as other mitigative actions.

In Closing
ECCC's foregoing comments are intended to provide expert support to project proponents
and decision-makers, in accordance with its program related responsibilities and
associated guidelines and policies. These comments are in no way to be interpreted as
any type of acknowledgement, compliance, permission, approval, authorization, or release
of liability related to any requirements to comply with federal or provincial statutes and
regulations. Responsibility for achieving regulatory compliance lies solely with the project
proponent.
I trust these comments will assist the NEB in the review of the proposed Line 10 Westover
Segment Replacement project. We hope the NEB will consider our comments in the
development of proposed conditions. If you have any questions or require clarification

Migratogy Birds

General Nesting Periods of Migratory Birds in Canada, ECCC has compiled core

nesting periods to allow for work to be done outside of the nesting period. This does not

mean there would not be nesting birds outside of these periods; it only reduces the risk

of encountering a nest.

ongoing project planning (including consideration of the results of ongoing stakeholder
consultation, Indigenous engagement, and field surveys). The route revisions shown in
the Supplemental ESA (August 2016) generally reduce impacts to biodiversity.
ECCC’s analysis indicates that the proponent has suggested five key measures that
would help to minimize the project's effects on wildlife populations and habitat:

. The proposed project footprint is mostly within an existing linear disturbance
feature (i.e., an existing pipeline ROW), as well as in agricultural areas.

0 Horizontal directional drilling (HDD) methods are proposed for two or three areas
where there are sensitive wetland features. Staging areas for HDD are located
within existing agricultural or disturbed areas, thereby minimizing or eliminating
disturbance within most natural areas.

- Timing of construction activities avoids the removal of habitat during key wildlife
life cycle stages.

I Measures will be implemented to detect and exclude wildlife from areas with active
construction areas.

0 Rehabilitation of the existing project footprint with native vegetation is proposed,
which may provide habitat for wildlife.

Correspondence from the proponent indicates that clearing/construction is proposed to
start in fall 2017, continue in the winter, and may extend into the spring/summer of 2018.
Migratory Birds
The Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994 (MBCA) prohibits the deposit of a substance
that is harmful to migratory birds in waters or an area frequented by migratory birds or in a
place from which the substance may enter such waters or such an area. The MBCA also
prohibits the possession of a migratory bird, nest or egg without lawful excuse. The
Migratory Bird Regulations (MBR) prohibit attempting in any manner to kill, injure or harass
migratory birds, as well as the disturbance, destruction, or taking of a nest, egg or nest
shelter of a migratory bird.
Migratory bird individuals and habitat occur within and adjacent to the project area. As
such, project activities including construction access, site grubbing, vegetation clearing,
construction and maintenance activities pose a threat to migratory birds and must be
undertaken in a manner that avoids contravening the MBCA and MBR.
The proponent is proposing to do HDD under significant wetlands so as to avoid waterfowl
and marsh bird breeding habitats. They also indicate that if HDD methodologies fail, open
trenching will be required.
The proponent is proposing to avoid vegetation clearing in waterbird or woodland habitat
between 4 May and 18 July. However, if vegetation clearing is required during this time,
the proponent will do the following. A qualified Wildlife Resource Specialist will conduct a
survey of the work area and provide a recommendation to the proponent less than seven
days prior to construction activities. If active nests are identified, species specific buffers
will be applied. Nests will be monitored during the implementation of work to identify what
level of disturbance the work is having on the nesting birds. Nests will be monitored to

2

determine when a nest is no longer active and the buffer can be removed. If nests are

found during construction activities, work will stop and the environmental inspector will be

notified. A Wildlife Species of Concern Discovery Contingency Plan will be developed and
followed. If breeding birds and/or nests are observed within the work area, work should not
continue in the buffer around the nest until it has been determined by a qualified biologist
that the young have left the nest. Construction activity would be suspended if active
habitat is discovered that cannot adequately accommodate an appropriate setback. The
right-of—way footprint will be reclaimed as soon as practical to restore pre-disturbance
condition.

ECCC’s Canadian Wildlife Service has compiled core nesting periods that may be of

assistance to the proponent in planning their activities. Working outside of core nesting

periods does not guarantee nesting birds will not be present; it only reduces the risk of
encountering a nest. We advise that avoidance is the best approach, and failing that
recommend consulting the (recently updated) website: httngfwwwesgooafgaom-
itmbfdefaultlasg?lang=En&n=1BiﬁEAFB-t for information about avoidance and how to
work during the core nesting periods. Additional links to information that may be useful can
be found in the References attached to this letter.

It is recommended that the proponent pay particular attention to the advice at the

referenced website: Determining the Presence of Nests (httgzﬂeogocafgaum-

itmbidefault.asg?lang=En&n=EDQ1 OCAC-i # 03 1}. While nest searching is not
recommended by ECCC in most situations, there are exceptions. Some additional
background information on nest searching along with alternatives and measures to help
avoid contravening the MBCA is provided below.

- ECCC does not recommend the use of nest surveys to determine whether nests are
present (with the exception of a few circumstances, e.g., nests in open areas, when
the birds nest on isolated trees, on man-made structures and/ or in colonies). The risk
of disturbing nests (which is a contravention of the MBCA) is high during nest surveys.
Additionally, there is a high probability of obtaining false negatives during nest surveys
(Le, a survey will determine that there are no nests present when in actuality there are
nests in the surveyed habitat).

. For forested habitats, ECCC considers "non-intrusive searching methods" such
as using point counts placed along transects more in line with our advice on
determining whether nests are present in an area. These methods use singing
territorial males as a proxy to establish whether the breeding season has
started.

. ECCC does not recommend establishing buffers around any nests identified through
nest surveys. Because ECCC recommends non-intrusive searching methods in most
instances, buffers are generally only appropriate as an avoidance tool when nests are
easily identified (such as nests in open areas, when the birds nest on isolated trees, on
man-made structures and/ or in colonies). In other habitats, it is unlikely that nest
surveys will detect all nests and thus buffers will not be established around all nests
that are actually present in the habitat.

. ECCC does not recommend marking active nests with ﬂagging tape, painted lath, or
other similar material as this increases the risk of nest predation.

3

- In circumstances where nests are readily identified and can be monitored without
disturbance to the nest, the proponent should consider submitting any completed nest
records to the Ontario Nest Records Scheme.

In consideration of the value of the landscape in the project study area to migratory birds,

and the proponent's proposed mitigation measures, as well as the application of our

advice and the following recommendations, ECCC is of the opinion that the project will not
result in significant adverse effects on migratory birds. However, since migratory bird nests
are very difficult to locate, it is unlikely the mitigation proposed (in the event that vegetation
clearing occurs in the migratory bird breeding season) will adequately protect nests or
eggs. The Proponent is urged to follow the advice in our recommendations.

Migratory Bird Protection Recommendations:

ECCC recommends that the proponent:

1. Develop and implement a management plan that avoids or minimizes the risk of
negative effects to migratory birds, their nests and eggs, in consultation with ECCC.

2. Consult and follow the guidance provided in the referenced websites relating to
migratory birds (See web links provided herein).

3. Avoid conducting any construction activities in migratory bird breeding habitat during
the breeding season.

Wetlands

Canada is a signatory to the Ramsar Convention, an international treaty focusing on

conservation of wetlands of international importance. A major obligation under the

Convention is implementation of principles, proposed in 1987 by Canada, for the wise use

of wetlands. The Convention notes the "wise use" of wetlands is defined as their

"sustainable utilization for the benefit of humankind in a way compatible with the

maintenance of the natural properties of the ecosystem". The federal government has

developed the Federal Policy on Wetland Conservation (FPWC); a government—wide
policy approved by federal Cabinet and adopted in 1991. The objective of the FPWC is to
promote the conservation of Canada's wetlands to sustain their ecological and socio-
economic functions, now and in the future.

The FPWC commits the federal government to the goal of no net loss of wetland functions

(physical, chemical, biological, and socio-economic) and is to be applied to all policies,

plans, programs, projects, and activities carried out by federal departments, boards and

agencies. The issuance of licenses for the project by the NEB is a federal activity and it is
our understanding that the NEB would, therefore, be responsible to comply with the goal
of no net loss of wetland function.

ECCC provides expertise in support of implementing the FPWC, with the aim to maintain

the functions and values derived from wetlands through a primary emphasis on impact

avoidance. Wetlands are a particular priority for ECCC because of their importance to the

maintenance of migratory bird populations for which the department has a responsibility

under the MBCA and for protection of species at risk for which it has a responsibility under
4

the SARA. The recommendations that follow are ECCC’s advice to help the NEB meet its

obligations under the FPWC.

Wetland Protection Recommendations:

ECCC recommends that the NEB ensure that the proponent:

4. Ensure impacts to ecological wetland functions are avoided, minimized and mitigated
through project design.

5. Completes all wetland crossings using HDD methods wherever possible to avoid
effects on wetlands, avoiding ecologically, socially and culturally important wetlands
using re-routes into non-sensitive habitats such as agricultural land where HDD
methods cannot be used.

6. If all effects to wetland function cannot be avoided or mitigated for ecologically,
socially and culturally important wetlands a compensation plan should be developed to
meet the goal of the no net loss of wetland functions.

Species at Risk

SARA

The purpose of the Species at Risk Act (SARA) is to prevent wildlife species from being

extirpated or becoming extinct, to provide for the recovery of wildlife species that are

extirpated, endangered or threatened as a result of human activity, and to manage species

of special concern to prevent them from becoming endangered or threatened. Schedule 1

of SARA provides a list of wildlife species at risk in Canada that are considered extirpated,

endangered, threatened, or of special concern. SARA provides automatic protection of
individuals and residences of aquatic species and migratory birds protected under the

MBCA, if they are listed as extirpated, endangered or threatened, whether these species

occur on federal or non-federal lands. These protections also apply to all other species

listed as extirpated, endangered or threatened located on federal lands.

ECCC understands that the NEB, through internal policy, applies section 79 of SARA to

decisions under $58 of the National Energy Board Act.

Subsection 79 of SARA provides:

79 ( 1) Every person who is required by or under an Act of Parliament to ensure that an
assessment of the environmental effects of a project is conducted, and every authority
who makes a determination under paragraph 67(a) or (b) of the Canadian
Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 in relation to a project, must, without delay,
notify the competent minister or ministers in writing of the project if it is likely to affect a
listed wildlife species or its critical habitat.
(2) The person must identify the adverse effects of the project on the listed wildlife
species and its critical habitat and, if the project is carried out, must ensure that
measures are taken to avoid or lessen those effects and to monitor them. The

5

measures must be taken in a way that is consistent with any applicable recovery
strategy and action plans.
Since the NEB is reviewing the project application under section 58 of the National Energy
Board Act, the NEB must also meet its duties under subsection 77(1) of SARA, which
provides:
Despite any other Act of Parliament, any person or body, other than a competent
minister, authorized under any Act of Parliament, other than this Act, to issue or
approve a licence, a permit or any other authorization that authorizes an activity that
may result in the destruction of any part of the critical habitat of a listed wildlife species
may enter into, issue, approve or make the authorization only if the person or body has
consulted with the competent minister. has considered the impact on the species'
critical habitat and is of the opinion that,
a) all reasonable alternatives to the activity that would reduce the impact on the
species' critical habitat have been considered and the best solution has been
adopted; and,
b) all feasible measures will be taken to minimize the impact of the activity on the
species' critical habitat.
Critical habitat is the habitat that is necessary for the survival or recovery of a listed wildlife
species and that is identified as the species' critical habitat in the recovery strategy or in
an action plan for the species. ECCC has determined that Line10 and the ROW pass
through areas flagged as containing critical habitat for Red-headed Woodpecker,
American Chestnut, Jefferson Salamander and Eastern \r‘v‘hip-poor-wiii.
As described above, the NEB is required under subsection 77(1) of the SARA to consider
the impact of the project on the species' critical habitat and must be of the Opinion that all
reasonable alternatives to the activity that would reduce the impact on the species' critical
habitat have been considered and the best solution has been adopted. Furthermore,
under subsection 77(1) the NEB must be of the opinion that all feasible measures will be
taken to minimize the impact of the activity on the species' critical habitat.
To assist the NEB in fulfilling its subsection 77(1) and section 79 responsibilities of the
SARA, ECCC is providing detailed information and advice regarding the Western Chorus
Frog - Great LakeslSt. Lawrence-Canadian Shield Population (GLSLCS), Jefferson
Salamander, Little Brown Myotis, Northern Myotis, Tri-colored Bat, Butternut, and other
species at risk.
Western Chorus Frog [GLSLCS]
The Western Chorus Frog (GLSLCS), hereafter referred to as Western Chorus Frog,
is designated as Threatened under Schedule 1 of SARA. The final Recovery Strategy
for the Western Chorus Frog partially identifies critical habitat using a combination of
habitat suitability, habitat occupancy and connectivity between local populations as
criteria. Based on the information contained in the final recovery strategy and the
habitat occupancy (observations) information from 1992 to 2012, critical habitat has
not been identified by ECCC for this species within the project footprint at this time.
6

That said, if present along the proposed route, the proposed work could kill, harm or
harass individuals and/or damage or destroy residences if appropriate mitigation is
not taken.
Temporary wetlands or shallow portions of permanent wetlands are the primary
suitable habitat features for most of the life cycle stages for Western Chorus Frog.
Interconnected wetlands and terrestrial environments provide connectivity between
local populations of Western Chorus Frog individuals, which is particularly important
for their survival and recovery within highly disturbed and fragmented landscapes.
Any opportunity to create suitable habitat (wetland features) with appropriate
vegetation characteristics within a natural vegetation network (e.g. within the right-of-
way) should be considered to benefit Western Chorus Frog and other wildlife species.
There are two key time periods during which both construction and maintenance
activities affecting biophysical attributes of Western Chorus Frog suitable habitat
should be avoided. Western Chorus Frog individuals are especially vulnerable at
breeding and hibernation sites. Breeding sites should be avoided between 15 March
and 30 July, and hibernation sites should be avoided between 1 October and 15
March, but to be conservative, even as early as 1 September.
Although Western Chorus Frog were not found during field surveys at 16 locations along
the proposed route, it is possible that this species is present in the project area. According
to the Ontario Herpetofaunal Atlas and ECCC data, the region in which the project is
located is known to support this species. Further, it appears that approximately 10 “Type
2” wetlands along the proposed route (as of 15 July 2016) were not surveyed for this
species as they were not deemed to have suitable amphibian breeding habitat. ECCC is
in the process of finalizing a new survey protocol specific to Western Chorus Frog which
we recommend the proponent utilize should any future monitoring surveys be conducted.
Western Chums Frag Pretection Recommendations
ECCC recommends that the NEB ensure the proponent implements the following:
7. Consult with ECCC to discuss methods and survey locations prior to conducting any
future surveys.
8. Contact ECCC for more information should Western Chorus Frogs be found in the
Project area or potential critical habitat is identified.
Jefferson Salamander
Jefferson Salamander is designated as Endangered under Schedule 1 of SARA. The
proposed project activities have the potential to kill, harm, harass individuals of this
species, and damage or destroy residences or habitat if not appropriately mitigated. It
appears the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) has provided
advice to the proponent to avoid these potential outcomes.
Pond suitability studies were completed in two areas in April and June 2016 where
access was available. Surveys methods followed protocols provided by MNRF. Shallow
vernal pools were observed during the first visit in the two woodland/wetland areas.
During the second visit, all vernal pools were found to be dry; therefore, a third visit was
'7

not completed. Due to property access restrictions, a section of one natural feature was
not surveyed in 2016; therefore, it could not be confirmed if this area contains habitat
features suitable for Jefferson Salamander and is assumed to be potential habitat.
The Project is located within 10 x 10 km standardized UTM grid squares that contain
critical habitat for Jefferson Salamander. Field studies confirmed there is no critical
habitat in the locations surveyed; however, it is assumed suitable habitat exists until
preconstruction surveys are complete. Consultation with MNRF regarding field
investigations and habitat suitability is ongoing and pre-construction surveys will be
conducted to confirm the presence or absence of Jefferson Salamander habitat in this
area. An HDD construction method is proposed to avoid disturbance of the potential
Jefferson Salamander habitat.
We understand the MNRF has engaged the proponent to minimize effects of the project
on this species. The mitigation as proposed appears to be adequate and appropriate.
Little Brown Myotis, Northern Myotis, Tri-oolored Bat
The Little Brown Myotis, Northern Myotis and Tri-colored Bat were emergency listed as
Endangered on Schedule 1 of SARA in 2014 because of sudden and dramatic declines
across the eastern portions of their range. They are also listed provincially under
Ontario’s Endangered Species Act. The proposed recovery strategy for these species
was posted to the SAR Public Registry on 24 December 2015 but is not yet finalized.
The proposed recovery strategy includes population and distribution objectives, a partial
identification of critical habitat, and activities likely to destroy critical habitat.
Whiie oniy hibernacuia are identified as criticai habitat at this time in the proposed
recovery strategy, other habitat is also important for the survival and recovery of these
species. These species have similar, but species specific, habitat needs for
ovenNintering, swarming, summer roosting, foraging and migration. Full details are in
their proposed recovery strategy, which is available at:
httgﬂwww.registreleg-sara‘registm.gc.cafdocurnentfdefault e.cfn1?clocurnentlD=24?5.
Based on the information provided by the proponent, suitable maternity roost habitat
exists within the project footprint and therefore the project may, if not appropriately
mitigated, affect the Little Brown Myotis, Northern Myotis or Tri-colored Bat by damaging
or destroying residences (roosts), thereby leading to mortality or harm to individuals.
Although the proponent identified potential maternity roost habitat they did not confirm if
it was being used by roosting bats.
It is unclear to ECCC if hibernation sites (i.e., critical habitat) was searched for or found
during biological surveys. It is important that the proponent conduct a search for
hibernacuia to identify if any is present prior to implementing the project.
The proponent has committed to not clearing vegetation between 1 June and 31 July in
potential maternity roost habitat. In June 2016 the MNRF recommended that no clearing
occur in May-July (and not in August unless acoustic surveys confirm no bats are
present). ECCC advises that maternity roosts can be used from late May through to mid-
August. Destruction of maternity roosts at any time of year has potential negative
consequences for returning bats. If any confirmed maternal roosts are found, the project
should be re-routed to ensure that they are not destroyed.

8

The proponent committed to avoid operation of heavy machinery within the areas

identified as potential bat maternity roost colonies between dusk and dawn, from 1 June

to 31 July, to limit the potential of causing harm, harassment, or mortality of bats. ECCC
is of the opinion that this will not minimize impacts on roosting bats. Operating heavy
machinery in potential bat maternity roosting habitat at any time of day is not
recommended in June or July as bats could be present and/or disturbed in daytime as
well as nighttime.

Bat Sgecies at Risk Protection Recommendations:

ECCC recommends that the NEB ensure the proponent implements the following:

9. Survey suitable maternity roost habitats, using appropriate methods (e.g., echo-
locators and/or thermal imaging cameras, in summer) to confirm use by roosting bats.
Should use be confirmed, such roosts and adjacent habitat should not be destroyed.

10. Ensure heavy equipment is not operated in potential bat maternity roosting habitat
anytime between 15 May and 31July. Operation of heavy equipment in August should
only occur if bats have been confirmed as not being present through acoustic surveys.

11. Search for hibernation sites prior to start of construction and if any are identified avoid
destroying and working near them in order to minimize the impact on these species.

12. Contact ECCC for more information if hibernation sites are identified.

Butternut

This species occurs in the project area. We understand the proponent has engaged the

MNRF to minimize effects of the project on this species. The mitigation as proposed

appears to be adequate and appropriate.

Other Sgecies at Risk

No Blanding’s Turtles, American Chestnut trees or Eastern Whip-poor-wills were located

during field surveys. The only Red-headed Woodpecker found (in 2013) was in a woodlot

that is no longer in the proposed project area. That said, the route contains suitable
habitat for these species and they may be present in the project area.

HDD is proposed under wetlands where turtles could hibernate. If HDD “fails”, Open

trenching would be required, and the proponent says it should occur prior to mid-October.

Should open trenching be required in turtle nesting habitat, it is proposed to occur before

15 May or after 30 June. However, the proposed recovery strategy for Blanding’s Turtle

states that nesting activity of Blanding’s Turtles in Ontario has been observed into the first

week of July and hatchlings emerge from nests throughout September and October.

More information on species at risk that may be affected by the project can be found on

ECCC's website (see references below).
