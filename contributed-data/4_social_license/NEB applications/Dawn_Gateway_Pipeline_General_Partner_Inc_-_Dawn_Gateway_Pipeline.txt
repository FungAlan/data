       This acknowledges your July 31, 2009 notificatiom of the Dawn Gateway pipeline project in.
       Lambton County (Ontario) and your request to be advised of my ministry’s level of interest in the
       project.
       Given the location and environni.ental circumstances of the preferred route, in particular no
       crossing of Indian Creek, we have no specific concerns from our environmental protection and
       management perspectives.
       We note that a Permit-to-take-water may be required under Section 34 of the Ontario Water
       Recourses Act for dc-watering of the construction trenches.
       If questions arise or if clarification is needed please contact the underthiied a.t (519) 873-5013 or
       via email atbifl.axmstron.gontario.ca.

      Re;        Dawn Gateway Pipeline General Partner Inc (Dawn Gateway GP)i Dawn Gateway
                 Project
                 Updated Evidence dated 17 July 2009, submitted pursuant to section 58 of the
                 National neryy Board Act
                 Ontario MInistry of Natural Resources Review
      Dear Ms. Erickson,
      Thank you for the opportunity to review the updated proposal and route for the Dawn Gateway
      Project This project is located in St. Clair and Dawn-Euphemia Townships, Lambton County,
      Ontario.
      We understand that the project consists of: 1) purchase of three existing natural gas
      transmission pipelines and 2) the construction of a new 24-inch diameter natural gas
      transmission pipeline. We have reviewed the information to determine whether the MNR
      mandate (e.g. natural heritage and natural resources) has been addressed and our comments
      are provided below- Please notethat the report was not available electronically at the time of
      our review.
       1) Purchase of three existing natural gas transmission pipelines
      Based on our understanding of the project, we have limited this part of our review to the
       administrative purchase of the three existing natural gas transmission pipelines.
       Please confirm the ownership of these three existing natural gas transmission pipelines and
      whether the Ministry Of Natural Resources will be require to change, and/or issue a new,
       disposition for Crown land. If the response is in the affirmative, the requirements of the MNR
       Class Environmental Assessment for Resource Stewardship and Facility Development (MNR
       Class EA for RSFD) will need to be met.
       if the project is beyond the administrate purchase and extends to physical activities, then the
       Ministry of Natural Resources will again need to be contacted as there are a significant number
       of natural heritage features along these three existing pipelines. including endangered and
       threatened species and provincially significant wetlands.
       2) ConstructIon of a new natural gas transmission pipeline
 £d lb.LO±
       The new natural gas transmission pipeline is proposed to originate from east of Highway 40 on
       Bentpath Line and proceeds south of the Benpath Line easterly to the Dawn Compressor
       Station.
       We have reviewed the alignment of the new natural gas transmission pipehne and we would like
       to offer the following natural heritage and natuml resource comments:
       Natural Heritage:
       The Endangered Species Act, 2001 came into force on June 30, 2008. Species at risk are
       known to occur in the area. In the immediate vicinity of the pipeline, MNR has known and
       recent occurrences of Eastern Foxsnake. Eastern Foxsnake is currently listed as a Threatened
       species on the Species at Risk in Ontario List (Ontario Regulation 230/08). On, or before,
       September 11. 2009. Eastern Foxsnake will be uplisted from Threatened to Endangered, and
       will receive immediate habitat protection In addition to its current species protection.
       There are multiple features consistent with habitat for Eastern Foxsnake along the proposed
       pipeline route. These include hedgerows, drains, Sydenham River corridor, old fields,
       woodlands and woodland edges. In order to prevent harni or harassment to individual
       Foxsnakes that may be present during construction and operation of the project, specific
       avoidance recommendations should be followed. These include but may not be limited to
       avoidance of important habitat features or areas identified through future surveys as well as
       avoidance of vegetation removal during periods when the species is most susceptible to
       disturbance (April 15 to June 1, and September15 to November 1). A Foxsnake sightings
       response and reporting protocol should be developed for the project in consultation with MNR to
       ensure the protection of any Foxsnakes encountered.
       It is possible based on the proposed Location that habitat for the species will be impacted by the
       pipeline project, which would require a permit under section 17(2) c) of the Endangered Species
       Act, 2007. Further consultation with MNR is recommended to determine the extent of Eastern
       Foxsnake habitat along the proposed route and to affirm if related vegetation removal would
       result in damage or destruction to this habitat under the Act.
       Kentucky Coffee-tree is another Threatened species protected under the Endangered Species
       Act, 2007 Considering the proximity of known occurrences of this species along the Sydenham
       River near the proposed pipeline route and presence of similar habitat at the proposed river
       crossing location, ft would be appropriate to conduct additional surveys for this species in
       woodland and riverbank areas near the proposed crossing.
       The issuance of an Endangered Species Act permit is considered to be a disposition of a Crown
        Resource; as such, the requirements of the \MNR Class EA for RSFD must be met. The MNR
       Class EA for RSFD allows for coordination amongst provincial and federal environmental
       assessment processes.
       The North Sydenham Creek, and other waterbodies, will need to be crossed as a result of the
       implementation of the project. We request confirmation that the transmission pipeline will use
       demonstrated environmental sensitive techniques to avoid and minimize impacts to the
       waterbodies and associated natural heritage features and their functions; particularly the
       pipeline crossings near North Sydenham Creek.
                                                                                                         2
£Ø/20d                                                                                          ET:ST 6O—9E—9flU

      The bed of many creeks and drains belong to the Crown, and are managed by the Ministry of
      Natural Resources. Where the Crown is the owner of the bed of the creeks! drains, an
      easement for the stream ! drain crossing will be required under the Public Lands Act. Please
      contact Ken Stemmler, A/ Lands Technician, at 519-354-8213 to apply for any authorizations
      required under the Public Lands Act.
      It appears that the proposed transmission pipeline avoids several or alt wooded areas.
      Confirmation on whether any of the wooded areas will be removed as part of the project is
      requested.
      Natural Resources:
      There are many petroleum wells identified on, or adjacent to, the proposed route. Please
      confirm that the petroleum resources, including wells and associated infrastructure, are
      appropriately addressed and will not be impacted. Those that will be impacted must meet the
      requirements of the Oil, Salt and Gas Resources Act.
      Thanks for the opportunity to provide comments.

            2) ConstructIon of a new natural gas transmission pipeline
           The new natural gas transmission pipeline is proposed to originate from
                                                                                      east of Highway 40 on

          The Endangered Species Act, 2007 came into force on June 30, 2008, Species
                                                                                              at risk are
          known to occur in the area, In the immediate vicinity of the pipeline, MNR has known and
          recent occurrences of Eastem Foxsnake. astem Foxsnake Is currently listed as a
          Threatened species on the Species at Risk in Ontario List (Ontario Regulation 230/08).
                                                                                                      1 or
                                                                                                      On
          before, September 11, 2009, Eastern Foxsnake will be upllsted from Threatened to
          Endangered, and will receive Immediate habitat protection In addition to Its current species
          protection.
          There are multiple features consistent with habitat for Eastern Foxsnalce along the proposed
          pipeline route. These include hedgerows, drains, Sydenham River corridor, old fields.
         woodlands and woodland edges. In order to prevent harm or harassment to individual
          Foxsnakes that may be present during construction and operation of the project, specific
          avoidance recommendations should be followed, These include but may not be limited to
         avoidance of Important habitat features or areas identified through future suiveys as well as
         avoidance of vegetation removal during periods when the species is most susceptible to
         disturbance (April 15 to June 1, and September15 to November 1). A Foxsnake sightings
         response and reporting protocol should be developed for the project in consultation with MNR
         to ensure the protectIon of any Foxsnakes encountered.
         it is possible based on the proposed location that habitat for the species wlii be impacted by
         the pipeline project, which would require a permit under section 17(2) c) of the Endangered
         Species Act, 2007, Further consultation with MNR is recommended to determine the extent of
         Eastem Foxsnake habitat along the proposed route and to affirm if related vegetation removal
         would result in damage or destruction to this habitat under the Act.
         Kentucky Coffee-tree is another Threatened species protected under the Endangered Species
        Act, 2007, ConsIdering the proximity of known occurrences of this species along the
        Sydenham River near the proposed pipeline route and presence of similar habitat at the
        proposed river crossing location, it would be appropriate to conduot additional surveys for this
        species in woodland and riverbank areas near the proposed crossing.
        The Issuance of an Endangered Species Act permit Is considered to be a disposition of a
        Crown Resource; as such, the requirements of the \MNR Class BA for RSFD must be met.
        The MNFI Class EA for RSFD allows for coordination amongst provincial and federal
        environmental assessment processes.
        The North Sydenham Creek, and other waterbodies, will need to be crossed as a result of the
        impiementation of the project. We request confirmation that the transmission pipeline will use
                                                                                                           a

Shawn R. Macdonald      directly affected landowners with respect to the proposed Dawn Gateway Pipeline
Lisa M. Walters         project. Some GAPLO landowners received late last week a letter from Dawn
R. Tyler Hortie         Gateway advising that the company would be entering upon their lands in the
Lindsay N. Lake         coming weeks for the purposes of the Dawn Gateway project. We are writing today
Sarah C. Low            on behalf of these landowners to advise that Dawn Gateway is not permitted to

Under separate cover we have provided you with a copy of the Notice of Motion
filed by GAPLO and CAEPLA for a stay of the NEB’s consideration of the Dawn
Gateway application pending the outcome of the ongoing OEB process. Even if the
Dawn Gateway project is determined to be in the federal jurisdiction and eventually
approved by the NEB, GAPLO and CAEPLA will be requesting that the Board
impose appropriate conditions to protect landowner interests before Dawn Gateway
is permitted access to their lands. In the circumstances, and unless and until Dawn
Gateway has the necessary legal authorization, we trust that Dawn Gateway will
comply with the instructions of landowners that it may not access their lands.
Please ensure that Dawn Gateway governs itself accordingly.

Hello Ms. Dutcher
I am writing to express my concerns as a landowner with regard to the Dawn Gateway application submitted to the
board back on May 6th. As I am sure you are aware we have had ongoing negotiations with Union Gas as the
 representative for Dawn Gateway for an easement for a new pipeline right of way and those negotiations were
terminated by the Union representatives on the pretense that we were too far apart and that it was taking too long to
negotiate a settlement. At that point in time the decision was made by Union/Dawn Gateway to assign rights to an
unused easement from Union to Dawn Gateway to facilitate building the new line.
I would respectfully ask that the board consider the following concerns when making their decision with respect to the
dawn Gateway application
• I do not feel that the Union Representatives could really negotiate anything.
• It is difficult to settle anything when the person at the table cannot make any decision and said so
• We negotiated in good faith and we do not feel they could
• Letter of Sept 24/09 attempts to undermine landowner committee
• Forcing access to my land by use of section 73 of the act is not bargaining in good faith.
• Compensation was never negotiable as stated by Dawn Gateway at open house in Wilkesport and promise of
starting point was not kept
• Negotiators have inferred that Landowner committee is disbanded – Not True
• Crossing agreements and control zone issues not resolved
In conjunction to these concerns and the application for access under section 73 of the NEB act I am wondering who is
looking out for my rights as a landowner. Please help me understand how Dawn Gateways application for access can
be granted without a comprehensive settlement with all landowners and my constitutional right to control the destiny
of my property until all legal proceeding and approvals are in place
Thank you for the opportunity to voice my concerns
I anxiously await the board decision
Regards
Jim Vandevenne

I am one of the land owners on the proposed Dawn Gateway Project.
Early in the Spring there was an outstanding proposal to construct a pipeline south of the existing pipeline.
Unfortunately the proposed pipeline would have directly run in to my two farm buildings, one being a riding arena
and one the horse barn. Dawn Gateway/Union Gas asked for a meeting through our committee member, Richard
Kraayenbrink and that was arranged so that myself, Richard Kraayenbrink and Mr. Rankin, the contractor who built
my riding arena would attend. The Dawn Gateway representatives attended and viewed my property and at that
time I indicated to them if they were prepared to build me a new barn and riding arena south of where they presently
exist they could go ahead with their project using the southern route but that it had to be completed by Fall and they
 had to use my contractor, Mr. Rankin. It was agreed at that time that Mr. Rankin would go get quotes and price the
relocation of the buildings and provide that to the Union Gas/Dawn Gateway representative.
Based on the understanding that my buildings were going to be relocated and to accommodate Union Gas and as
time was of the essence it was agreed that Union Gas could have a survey team attend at my property to determine
the exact location where the pipeline would be. At that time there was no mention made to me that the relocation
process was off the table or couldn't proceed due to lack of funds. The survey team did attend and did get their work
done.
Approximately two weeks later I contacted the representative from Union Gas, Merve Weisher and asked him where
to send the quotes and that I needed a definite time line when the barns would be completed for the upcoming Winter
season. At that time the Union Gas representative told me that they didn't have the money in the budget to do this
and it was never anticipated that this would happen and that we were only discussing this issue.
Obviously their tactic was to get the survey team on the property and intentionally misrepresented their intentions just
to get access to my property. I felt this was an exceptionally dirty trick and I now have absolutely no trust in
anything that Dawn Gateway or Union Gas says. They will say to you that this was simply a mistake in communication
and I will say to you there was no mistake in communication because Mr. Kraayenbrink and Mr. Rankin both agreed
in subsequent conversations with me that it was their opinion that the building relocations were to proceed and all
they needed were the quotes from Mr. Rankin to get started.

If the jurisdiction of this proposed pipeline is transferred from OEB to a NEB regulated pipeline our home will be
entirely within the safety zone of the new pipeline. This would render the house worthless.
At this time DGW wishes to do environmental, archaeological and geotechnical surveys on our property, but neglects
to assess the impact on my home’s property value.
I have received a letter informing me of DGW’s motion to order access to my property, while I still hold a letter asking
for my permission.
DGW has repeatedly contacted us individually, circumventing our request to negotiate through the landowner’s
 association.
We need to talk will all parties present, all intentions disclosed, and all issues resolved before DGW proceeds.

Dear Ms Dutcher;
   I would like to make some comments as a landowner who is involved in the Dawn Gateway appllcation submitted to the
board on May 6th. We own property where Dawn Gateway intends to construct the new llne.Between my son.my wifa and
myself we Will have 250 acres the pipeFine will cross so the easement will involve 8-9 acres. My wife and I are full time
farmers.
  DG held an 1t 0pj house” on Dec 1 1f2008 to announce their intentions on the project.They held a second Open House on
Feb   10109.  Shortly after that the Landowners held a meeting and elected a committee to represent them. The committee
called Dawn Gateway and initiated the first meetIng. The two representatives they sent to the meeting said they were
representing Dawn Gateway but they were Union Gas employees. We discussed many items over a number of meetings and
we were moving positively ahead although the 2 representatives involved where unable to make any major decisions until they
consulted a higher authority so many decisions took longer than necessary. In most negotiations I have been Involved with
both parties have their position and you work towards a settlement. When the issue of finances regarding the easement and
things connected with the easement came up Dawn Gateway gave us an offer. We came back with a counter offer and Dawn
Gateway came back to the next meeting and gave us till 11 59 p.m. on July 15,2009 to accept the offer or it would be
withdrawn. I don’t believe that is bargaining in good faith. We did not accept the offer and that ended our meetings with Dawn
Sateway. They then decided to secure an unoccupied easement from Union Gas and notified the landowners that the line
would be built on it Since that lime they have basically ignored the comrtjittee and have tried to deal directly with the
landowners. AAS you are aware they have asked to use section 73 of the WEB Act to secure access to 5 of the landowners
properties where they wishlo do some work this fall, Furthermore they have contacted these landowners and in one case the
indowner told us the gentlemen offered them $100.00 to sign a rrn allowing them to do some work on their pitperty. They
 also told this individual that the landowners cornrrjittee had disbanded which is not true. How can you trust individuals when
they go behind your back and teU mistwths. I am truly d(sappointed in the tactics that are have happened recently. To me
flawn Gateway Is a new company and this is not a very good way to built public relations.
     realize the company may have timetables to meet but we have told them from the first time they asked for access to land
fhat no access would be granted till an agreement was in place for all segments of the project(as it related to the landowners)
 and signed by all landowners involved. We initiated the first meeting On April 7I0 and now here it is October and no
settlement Is In place. The landowners elected a committee and. instructed that committee to make decisions on their behalf.
 Now it appears Dawn Gateway wishes to use the strong arm of the law by trying to evoke Section 73 of the NEB. This would
 be a precedent setting case and would have far reaching implications, I would ask that Dawn Gateway not be allowed to use
 Section 73 of the NEB act lor accessto landowners property. I can assure that ifihey would have been prepared to negotiate
in good faith with the committee a settlement would now be in place and they could proceed with their required work they wish
to do this fall, Thank you for your attention.

                                                                        th•
                                                                        6
           Gateway application submitted to the board back on May           As I am sure you aTe aware
           we have had ongoing     negotiations with  Union Gas  as the representativ e for Dawn
           Gateway for an easement for new pipeline right of way and those      negotiations  were
           terminated by Union Gas saying that we were too far apart and would take to long for
           settlement. At that time, UnionlDawn Gateway to assign rights to an unused easement
           from Union Dawn Gateway building a new line.
                    I would ask that the board consider the following points:
           -Crossing agreement and control zone issues not resolved.
           -We negotiated in good faith and we don’t believe they could.
           -Compensation was never negotiable as stated by Dawn Gateway open house as promise
           at starting point
           -Forcing access to my land by use off section 73 of act is not bargaining.
           -Negotiators have inferred that landowners committee is disbanded- Not True.
           -I would like to see comprehensive settlement with all landowners in place before legal
           proceeding and approvais are in force.
                    Thank you for this opportunity to voice my concerns, I wait for the boards
           decis ion.

          This letter Is to communicate my displeasure with the negotatlons conducted by
          Union Gas regarding the Dawn Gateway Pipeline project.
          As a landowner affected by the proposed pipeline I would have been satisfied
          with the Union Gas initial offer whereby they purchased a new ‘right-of-way’.
          However, it is my understanding that they would not compensate us comparably
          to the precedent set in the Union Gas Lobo line of a few years ago.
          It appears that Union Gas dropped this initial offer and reverted to use of the
          existing right-of-way as a way of pressuring the landowners.
          Our negotiating committee has presented the landowners case very well while
          forced to comply with a very short time-line.
          I think that out of fairness to the landowners, the NED would request that Union
          Gas revert back to the original plan with compensation made according to
          previous precedent. I feel that NEB approval of the project should be contingent
          on thisMappening.

To Whom It May Concern
As a landowner at 835 Bentpath Line I wanted to voice my concerns regarding the intended pipeline that will be
installed on my property. It is extremely worrisome to me that Dawn Gateway does not seem willing to negotiate with
the committee for the landowners, and are already trying to cut corners for permits, even at this early stage. My
property is very unique in that it is completely surrounded by trees, many trees deep, all the way around. In buying
the property 3 years ago, this was the selling point for me and my husband. Not only for the privacy factor, but also
because these trees provide a deterrance to keep my children safetly on the property. I want to know that my
property will be protected from damage, that my concerns will be addressed, and that I will be treated fairly in the
 installation of this pipeline. For the record, I will not permit Dawn Gateway access to my property until they have
taken the proper avenues with permits, have addressed my concerns regarding damage and compensation, have
reached an agreement with the landowners committee, or have been granted the right by court order. It is very
disconcerting to me that Dawn Gateway feels they have the right to enter my property, do whatever they want on my
property without reaching a FAIR agreement for all concerned, or even showing any gestures of good faith that they
care what the landowners want. Please hear and listen to the voices of the 'private' property owners who feel that
they are being taken advantage of.

      Hello Ms. Dutcher
           As a landowner and committee member I would like to address my concerns about Dawn-Gateways
      application.
      #1 Union representatives, our committee had meetings with, were only messengers
      #2 We never had a representative at a meeting that had the authority to make a decision
      #3 From the very first meeting c3aplo —Union agreed to have Strathroy-Lobo as a starting point
      #4 Dawn had all spring and summer to negotiate a starting point
      #5 Now Dawn-Gateway is looking to others to help fix their mistakes
      #6 Dawn-Gateway representatives are telling landowners that the committee has been disbanded
      #7 Dawn Gateways employee said to the committee that an upper management person said to him;
      why are we negotiating with these landowners, just expropriate them
      #8 Dawn Gateway has filed for application on section 73 and also does not want a detailed mute
      hearing
      #9 it feels like a ‘get out of our way attitude’
      Thank you for giving me the opportunity to express my concerns and I am looking forward to hearing the
      Board’s decision.

                             St. Clair and Dawn-Euphemia Townships, Lambton County, Ontario
                   Thank you for your July 31, 2009 letter requesting specialist advice from Environment Canada (EC)
                   pursuant to section 5 of the Federal Coordination Regulations (FCR) under the Canadian
                   Environmental Assessment Act (CE.A) for the Dawn Gateway Pipeline project
                   Environment Canada does not have any obligations as a Responsible Authority under CEM for
                   this proposed project We have reviewed the information provided and have determined that we
                   are able to provide specialist information and knowledge to the National Energy Board (NEB) in
:5                 context of our role as an expert federal authority pursuant to section 12(3) of CE.AA, Our
                   comments specifically pertain to our departmental interests in the potential effects of this project
                   on air quality, water quality, wetlands, migratory birds, and species at risk, and associated
                   recommendations for the CEA Screening Report
                   Please note that Environment Canada has a regulatory interest in migratory birds, species at risk
                   and water quality as administrator of the Migratoiy Birds Convention Act, 1994, Species at Risk
                  Act, Canadian Environmental Protection Act, ‘1999 and subsection 36(3) of the Fisheries Act,
                  respectively. Please refer to the attached Appendix, which provides further details of legislation
                  and policies that should be consulted in context of our comments and recommendations.
                  Project and Site Information
                  It is our understanding that the project consists of the purchase of three existing natural gas
                  transmission pipelines (the Belle River Mills Line, St. Clair River Crossing Line and Union St. Clair
                                                                                                                                     J4
                  Line) and the construction of a new 17km natural gas transmission pipeline (the Bickford to Dawn
                  Line), and that liked together this pipeline system will be known as the Dawn Gateway Pipeline. It is
                  our understanding that federal land is not present in the project area.
                  According to the information received the preferred route of the new pipeline section contains
                  multiple natural heritage features of interest, including watercourses, woodlands and old fields,

                including potential habitat for species at risk, Watercourse crossings and vegetation removal (frees
                and other herbaceous vegetation) will be required, however the extent of vegetation
                removalfdisturbance is not clear (for Instance, will any wooded areas or wetlands be impacted?).
                The CE,AA Screening should clearly describe the habitats to be impacted during all project phases
                and assess the impacts in terms of ecological functions (i.e. habitat for particular species, wildlife
                movement corridors, etc.).
                CEAA Scope of Project
               We suggest that your scope of project to be assessed includes construction, operation, maintenance
               and decommissioning, including any required deconstruction, demolition and waste material
               disposal. We further suggest your project scope includes site access and preparation (including
               clearing, excavation grading, stockpiling, etc.) and site servicing. In order to meet the requirements
               of CEPA, we further recommend the assessment include the impacts of mitigative measures,
               cumulative effects, significance of effects, and the need for a follow-up program.
               Migratory Birds
              Adverse environmental effects on migratory birds could occur through disturbance or through habitat
               loss or impairment, but they may also occur through direct mortality (destruction of individuals or their
               nests). These impacts could all potentially occur during site access, site preparation (including
              vegetation clearing) and equipment staging, materials stockpiling, or construction. The Screening
              should include a consideration of potential impacts on migratory birds during all project phases,
              including any impacts on interior forest habitat.                   It should also include the detailed methodologies,
              results and analysis of the plant and wildlife surveys that we understand were planned for September
              2009 and the spring of 2010. EC would appreciate the opportunity to review the methodologies and
              results of these surveys.
              Measures to prevent significant impacts will depend on the wildlife species utilizing the area, but may
              include timing of works to avoid sensitive breeding periods and avoiding disturbance of important
              migratory bird habitat (such as avoiding fragmentation of any forest interior habitats or impairment of
             wildlife movement corridors).
             As indicated in Appendix A of this letter, migratory birds, including their nests, are protected under
             the Migratory Birds Convention Act against disturbance or harm, and EC therefore will be
             recommending that mitigation measures be implemented to avoid siQnificant adverse environmental
             effects on migratory bird species potentially breeding In the project are&. As mentioned earlier,
             mitigation will depend on the species using the area, but may include the following timing
             recommendation:
             •      Project works or activities with the potential to destroy or disturb migratory birds, such as site
                    grubbing, vegetation clearing, and site access/staging/stockpiling should not take place in
                    migratory bird habitat during the breeding season that, in this location, is defined to be from May
                 Please note that these measures and recommendations are solely intended to avoid significant adverse environmental
             effects on mIgratory birds. This advtce does riot provide an authorization for Incidental take or for the disturbance,
             destruction or taking of nests under the Migratory Bird Regulations (MBRs), nor does it prdvide a guarantee that the project
             will not result in contravention of the MSRs. It remains the proponent’s responsibility to meet the requirements of the MBRs.
             Should this project or activities associated with it result in the contravention of the MSRS, prosecution under the Migratory
             Blids Convention Act, 1994 may be initiated,
                                                                             2

                      1—July31.
                     If the proponent must conduct works that could destroy migratory birds or their nests within
                     breeding bird habitat during the identified breeding season for migratory birds, a nest survey
                     should be conducted by a qualified avian biologist prior to commencement of the works to
                     identify and locate active nests of species covered by the Migratory Sirds Convention Act, 1994.
                      A mitigation plan (which may include establishing appropriate buffers around active nests)
                     should then be developed to address any potential impacts on migratory birds or their active
                     nests, and should be reviewed by Environment Canada prior to implementation.
                Water Quality
                environment Canada’s mandate to advocate for the protection of water qusflty stems from the
                pollution prevention provisions of the Fisheries Act, which are administered by EC. Subsection
                36(3) of the Fisheries Act specifies that, unless authorized by federal regulation, no person shall
                deposit or permit the deposit of deleterious substances of any type in water frequented by fish.
                Please be advised that the Compliance and Enforcement Policy for the Habitat Protection and
                Pollution Prevention Provisions of the Fisheries Act states that compliance with the federal
                Fisheries Act is mandatory.
                Substances (such as sediment and gravel) that smother nesting areas or spawning grounds, or
                interfere with reproduction, feeding or respiration of fish, may be considered deleterious. In
                addition to the potential for sediment (from exposed soils) to enter receiving waters during site
                preparation and construction, runoff from roads and parking lots typically contains sediment as well
                as oil, grease, and heavy metals that, in elevated levels, may be harmful to aquatic biota.
                However, any substance with a potentially harmful chemical, physical or biological effect on fish or
               fish habitat may be considered deleterious.
               The CEA Screening should include a consideration of any potential Impacts on water quality
               resulting from this project, particularly on any wetlands or other surface waters near the site as
               site preparation, construction, operation or maintenance works and accidental spills could impact
               water quality.
               The Screening should clearly identify any areas that contain surface waters or wetlands (or drain to
               surface waters or wetlands) and assess the adverse effects of the project on these features (for
               instance, where the project crosses these features).
               Measures should be identified in the Screening and implemented to prevent the release of
               deleterious substances (including sediment) during construction, operation and maintenance into
              any receiving waters/wetlands. A sediment and erosion control plan should be developed if
               necessary to mitigate potential effects on water quality, and appropriate measures should be
              adopted to minimize any impacts of accidental spills during construction, operation and
              maintenance.
              Air Quality
              The CEAA Screening should consider construction related local air quality impacts, such as dust
              and vehicle exhaust emissions. Mitigation measures should be adopted to reduce dust/particle
              emissions/formation from construction activities and construction vehicle movements to minimize
              air emissions during the construction phase. To mitigate impacts on ambient air quality from
                                                                3

                vehicular emissions and from concentrations of chemical pollutants, exposed soils, dust and other
                particulate matter, EC recommends the proponent:
                •    Use new or well-maintained heavy equipment and machinery, preferably fitted with muffler!
                    exhaust system baffles and engine covers.
                •   Comply with operating specifications for heavy equipment and machinery.
                •   Minimize operation and idling of gas-powered equipment and vehicles, in particular, during
                    smog advisories,
                •   Minimize vehicle traffic on exposed soils and stabilize high traffic areas with clean gravel
                    surface layer or other suitable cover material.
               •    Avoid excavation, and other construction activities with potential to release airborne
                    particulates, during windy and prolonged dry periods.
               •    Stabilize stockpiled excavated soils in areas that are upwind of sensitive receptors.
               •    Cover or otherwise contain loose construction materials that have potential to release airborne
                    particulates during their transport, installation or removal.
               •    Spray water, as appropriate, to minimize the release of dust from gravel, paved areas and
                    exposed soils. Use chemical dust suppressants only where necessary on problem areas.
              •     Restore disturbed areas as soon as possible to minimize the duration of soil exposure.
              Further specific guidance may be sought in the “Best Practices for the Reduction of Air Emissions
              from Construction and Demolition Activities” prepared for Environment Canada by Cheminfo
              Services (March 2005).         Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require a copy of the
              aforementioned guidance document.
              Species at Risk
              The CEAA Screening must consider whether adverse effects could occur on Species at Risk
              (SAR). Section 79(2) of the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) requires that when a federal E      1
                                                                                                                 k is
              carried out on a project that may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, adverse environmental
              effects must be identified, mitigation measures must be taken to avoid or lessen adverse effects,
              and environmental effects monitoring must be conducted. Please see the Appendix of- this letter for
              additional information on the relevant legislated requirements of SARA, including the notification
              provisions (which come into effects once it is known that a species at risk may be impacted by a
             project).
             One of the purposes of SARA is to to manage species of special concern to prevent them from
             becoming endangered or threatened. In this context, we also recommend that all federal EAs
             consider potential impacts on SARA Schedules 2 and 3 species (which are in the process of being
             re-evaluated), species listed by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada
             (COSEWIC), and any species of local, regional or provincial concern. All of these species are
             collectively referred to as “species of conservation concern”.
             In order to ensure species at risk have been adequately addressed in the CEM Screening, we
             generally recommend that existing background information should be collected from all relevant
             sources to support a determination of whether species of conservation concern within the zone of
                                                                 4

                 influence of the project may be known or expected to use the site or adjacent lands. We always
                 recommend at a minimum that proponents consuluthe Natural Heritage Information Centre
                 database maintained by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources in Peterborough for known
                 occurrences of species at risk. The Environment Canada Canadian Wildilfe Service Species at
                                                                                          -
                 Risk Web Mapping Application should also be consulted to determine if occurrences or ranges of
                any         SARA           Schedule         I       listed       species        overlap        with       the       site:
                 (http://www.sis.ec.pc.ca/ec species/ec species e.phtml).    2
                 If ranges of SARA listed species overlap with the study area, information on the habitat
                 requirement/preferences of the species should be consulted and compared to habitat descriptions
                for the study area, Should the habitat preferences of the identified species be present, and in all
                cases when occurrences have been identified, a qualified biologist should conduct a thorough
                biological inventory of all areas of natural habitat that may be affected by the project and have the
                potential to support species at risk. A strategy should then be developed to protectany identified
                species at risk, with a primary focus on avoidance.
                Based on our review of the August 26, 2009 comments provided by the Aylmer District Ministry of
                Natural Resources, it is our understanding that MNR has advised of the known occurrences of
                two provincially listed species at risk near the project site that are also SARA listed, Eastern
                Foxsnake and Kentucky Coffee-tree, both of which are listed on Schedule I as Threatened. The
                proponent should complete the desktop exercise discussed in our comments above to determine
               whether any other federally listed species or species of conservation concem may occur at or
                near the project site,           Should it be determined that further site investigations are required to
               confirm the presence of SAR or their preferred habitats,- Environment Canada would be interested
               in reviewing and commenting on the methods used to be used to conduct the biological inventory
               as well as any measures that are devised to identify and protect species at risk.
               In addition to the resources above that can be consulted regarding the possible locations of SAR,
               Environment Canada has also produced a guide that can be used as a general reference for
               dealing with SAR in EA. The ‘Environmental Assessment Best Practice Guide for Wildlife at Risk
               in Canada” (February 2004) is available via the Internet on the Environment Canada website at
               http://www.cws-scfec,gc,ca/publications/AbstractTerru,late.cfm7lang=e&id=1 069,                                      The
               aforementioned guide is primarily targeted to project proponents and those individuals who are
               preparing EAs. It outlines the general responsibilities of proponents and EA practitioners for
              considering wildlife at risk in an EA and promotes more thorough, efficient and consistent
              gathering and assessment of information regarding wildlife at risk,
              Environment Canada’s foregoing comments are intended to provide expert support to project
              proponents and decision-makers, in accordance with its program related responsibilities and
             associated guidelines and policies. These comments are in no way to be interpreted as any type
             of acknowledgement, compliance, permission, approval, authorization, or release of liability
              related to any requirements to comply with federal or provincial statutes and regulations.
              Responsibility for achieving regulatory compliance and cost effective risk and liability reduction lies
             solely with the project proponent.

               Regulatory and Policy Context for Environment Canada’s Comments and Advice
               Environment Canada’s mandate to protect the environment and to actively promote sustainable
               development extends beyond the Department’s legislated responsibilfties for undertakings that
               trigger the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. Our review and comments are related, but not
               limited, to our areas of interest and expertise arising from the following legislation. More information
               is available on-line, as indicated.

               httixJ/laws.iustice.pc.calen/E-1 O/text.html
               The Department of Environment Act provides Environment Canada (EC) with general responsibility
               for environmental management and protection. Its obligations extend to and include all matters over
              which Parliament has jurisdiction, and have not by law been assigned to any other department,
               board, or agency of the Government of Canada as related to: preservation and enhancement of the
              quality of the natural environment (e.g. water, air, soil), renewable resources including migratory
              birds and other non-domestic flora and fauna, water, meteorology, and coordination of policy and
              programs respecting preservation and enhancement of the quality of the natural environment.
              The Department of Environment Act states that EC has a mandated responsibility to advise heads of
              federal departments, boards and agencies on matters pertaining to the preservation and
              enhancement of the quality of the natural environment. This responsibility is reinforced as per
              subsection 12(3) of CEPA, which states that federal departments must provide specialist and expert
              information or knowledge to other federal departments or review panels.

              The Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA) contributes to sustainable
              development through pollution prevention and protects the environment, human life and health
              from the risks associated with toxic substances. Key parts of CEPA include:

                The Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 enables the government to manage a toxic
                substance throughout its life cycle. Proviions under CEPA require Environment Canada, under
                certain conditions, to develop a “regulation or preventive or control instrument” for a substance
                that Is found to be “toxic” under the Act. CEPA further requires the virtual elimination of
                anthropogenic releases to the environment of substances that are declared toxic and that are
                bioaccumulative and persistent. CEPA also establishes the requirements for the assessment of
                chemicals, polymers and products of biotechnology, prior to import or manufacture of substances
                not on the Domestic Substances List.
                Fisheries Act
                http://www.ec.gc.ca/ele-ale/policieslc and e fisheries act/main e.asp,
                Environment Canada’s mandate to advocate for the protection of water quality stems from the
               pollution prevention provisions of the Fisheries Act, which are administered by EC. Please be
               advised that the Compliance and Enforcement Policy for the Habitat Protection and Pollution
               Prevention Provisions of the Fisheries Act states that compliance with the federal Fisheries Act is
               mandatory. Subsection 36(3) of the Fisheries Act specifies that, unless authorized by federal
               regulation, no person shall deposit or permit the deposit of deleterious substances of any type in
               water frequented by fish, or in any place under any conditions where the deleterious substance, or
               any other deleterious substance that results from the deposit of the deleterious substance, may
               enter any such water. Proponents should note that only a federal regulation under the Fisheries
              Act or another Act of Parliament can authorize a discharge of a deleterious substance; no federal
               permit, provincial, territorial or municipal regulatory permit or approval allows for exemption from
              the Fisheries Act,
               In the ipplication of the Fisheries Act, court cases have accepted that a discharge or effluent that
              is acutely lethal to fish is deleterious. In other words, results of tests designed to determine
              Whether fish will die in an effluent or discharge within a specified time period will determine one
              aspect of deleteriousness. However, any substance with a potentially harmful chemical, physical
              or biological effect on fish or fish habitat Is also deleterious. For example, substances (such as
              sediment) that smother nesting areas or spawning grounds, or interfere with reproduction, feeding
              or respiration of fish at any point in their life cycle are also considered deleterious. In general, any
              substance with a potentially harmful chemical, physical or biological effect on fish or fish habitat
              may be considered deleterious.
              The act of depositing a deleterious substance should be considered a violation of the Fisheries
              Act, regardless of whether the water itself is made deleterious by the deposit. Subsection 36(3) of
              the Fisheries Act makes no allowance for a mixing or dilution zone. Any measurements or tests
             to determine whether something is deleterious should be done where the substance is at its
              highest concentration, typically at the point of discharge to the receiving water.

             http://w.cws-scf.ec.qc,ca/leciislations/laws1 e.cfm
             The disturbance, destruction or taking of a nest, egg, nest shelter, eider duck shelter or duck box
             of a migratory bird are prohibited under section 6 of the Migratory Bird Regulations (WBRs), under
             the authority of the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994 (MBCA)*. “Incidental take” is the killing or
             harming of migratory birds due to actions, such as economic development, which are not primarily
             focused on taking migratory birds. No permit can be issued for the incidental take of migratory birds
             or their nests as a result of economic activities.
                                                                 8

                 Under section 5.1 of the MBCAI no person shall deposit or permit to be deposited oil, oil wastes or
                 any other substance harmful to migratory birds in any waters or any area frequented by migratory
                 birds.
                •    Please note that amendments to the MBCA in Bill C-15 came into force on June 28 2005.
                     This pollution prohibition was previously contained in s.35(1) of the Migratory Bird
                     Regulations, which has now been repealed and is included as s5.1 of the amended MaCA,

                Species at Risk Act
                http://www.speciesatrisk.gc.ca/default e.cfm
                The Species at Risk Act (SARA) has resulted In a consequential amendment to CEAR that amends
                the definition of “environmental effect’ to clarify that all federal LAs must always consider adverse
                effects on listed wildlife species, and the critical habitat or residences of individuals of that species.
                In addition, section 79(2) of SARA requires that when a federal LA Is carried out on a project that
                may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, adverse environmental effects must be identified,
                mitigation measures must be taken to avoid or lessen adverse effects, and envIronmental effects
                monitoring must be conducted.
                SARA was proclaimed on June 5, 2003 and is intended to provide protection for individuals of wildlife
                species at risk listed under Schedule I of the Act their residences (dwelling places, such as a den or
                nest or other similar area that is occupied or habitually occupied by one or more individual during part
               or all of its life cycle) and critical habitat (that part of areas used or formerly used by the species to
               cany out their life processes that is deemed essential for survival or recovery). Critical habitat will be
               identified for each listed species in Recovery Strategies or Action Plans. The prohibitions under
               SARA came into force on June 1 2004 and apply to listed (Schedule I) endangered and
               threatened species for all federally protected aquatic species and migratory birds (including their
               residences) found anywhere, as well as to all endangered and threatened species, when found on
               federal lands.
               Pursuant to Section 79(1) of SARA, if any listed wildlife species, its critical habitat or the residences
               of individuals of that species may be adversely impacted by the project, the Responsible Authorities
               for the CEAA assessment must notify the competent Minister responsible for the listed species in
              writihg. Fisheries and Ocean Canada is responsible for aquatic species at risk and can provide
               advice regarding potential impacts on these species covered under the Fisheries Act. Notifications
              in relation to listed terrestrial species are to be sent to EC, and for this project may be sent to my
              attention.

The said pipeline project is located in St. Clair Township and land use policy for this area is detailed in the Township
of St. Clair Official Plan/Zoning By-law, the County of Lambton Official Plan and the Province of Ontario Provincial
Policy Statement. In terms of this project, the Township goals and policies provides support for the oil and gas
pipeline industry and requires adjacent development to be setback from pipelines in order to reduce land use impacts
such as those associated with the future maintenance or future excavations of pipelines, safety (such as separation
from the releases of flammable or explosive materials from human or agricultural housing), the potential for multiple
pipelines in corridors and the overall land use compatibility. That being said, approvals of pipelines and pipeline
corridors will have an impact on the potential to (re)develop future buildings and developments adjacent to the
pipeline corridor. As such, approvals of the location of pipelines should account for appropriate setbacks from the
 existing built structures and their sensitive land use patterns.
Furthermore, the Township Plan recognizes significant woodlands which includes tree-covered lands that are 0.4
hectares or greater in area and other significant natural heritage features. The woodlands should be protected and
enhanced and woodland corridors are to be improved. Policy wording in the plan intends that natural gas lines be
prohibited in wooded areas greater than 0.4 hectares unless authorized under an environmental assessment process.
The Official Plan policies require a 2 to 1 minimum replacement to enlarge significant woodlands (tree covered areas
greater than 0.4 ha in area) where the environmental assessment supports the removal of trees.
Any approvals should have regard for the above noted land use concerns established in the publicly scrutinized and
approved policy documents.

Dear Madam Secretary,
We are counsel for GAPLO-Union (Dawn Gateway) and CAEPLA with respect to the proposed Dawn Gateway pipeline
project. Please be advised that the Ontario Energy Board has now released its decision in EB-2008-0411, the
application by Union Gas for leave to sell the St. Clair to Bickford pipeline. We will write again shortly to provide a
copy of the decision along with our submissions with respect to same.
Yours very truly,

                        The OEB has found that the St. Clair Line and any proposed extension of the line
Alexandra Rosu
                        between Bickford and the Dawn Hub will be subject to provincial regulation. This
Paul J. Hendrikx
                        ruling is binding on both Union Gas, as applicant in EB-2008-0411, and Dawn
                        Gateway, an intervenor in the OEB proceeding. As the OEB explains at paragraph
                        22 of its reasons:
Counsel
Gerald H. L. Fridman                             The Board understands Union’s view that the St. Clair
Q.C., F.R.S.C.
                                                 Line should become subject to federal jurisdiction.
Gordon B. Carmichael
                                                 That does not mean that this Board does not have
John W. Makins
                                                 jurisdiction to decide this issue. Moreover, Union has
                                                 put this issue in play. Both Union and DGPL have
** Certified by the Law
Society as a specialist                          indicated that the project is not likely to proceed
in Civil Litigation.
                                                 unless the Board agrees that the St. Clair Line
                                                 should become federally regulated. The Board
                                                 believes that it has both the jurisdiction and the

                 obligation to hear submissions and to make a decision.
                [emphasis added]
The OEB also notes that it has particular interest in the jurisdictional issue given that
it already issued a decision on the issue when the St. Clair Line was first constructed
20 years ago. The OEB was supported in its previous finding that the St. Clair Line
was provincial by the NEB and the courts, and has now determined in EB-2008-0411
that there is no change proposed to the St. Clair Line as part of the Dawn Gateway
project which is sufficient to change the constitutional character of the line from
provincial to federal.
In regard to the continuing provincial jurisdiction of the St. Clair Line and any
proposed extension between Bickford and Dawn, the OEB has found:
         •   “The only federal undertaking is St. Clair Pipeline LP which is less than
             a kilometre in length commencing at the international border in the
             middle of the St. Clair River and terminating at Union’s St. Clair Valve
             Site in Lambton County. The existing St. Clair Line which is 11.7 km
             and the proposed new section of line which is 17 km are not integral or
             essential to the St. Clair River crossing” (paragraph 25);
         •    “Union applied to the Board for leave to construct a similar pipeline in
             1993 which was turned down when the Board determined that there was
             no economic justification for the proposed facility. There was no
             indication that the new line should fall within federal jurisdiction”
             (paragraph 25);
         •   “At the end of the day, the Union and DGPL arguments rely on the new
             ownership structure and the fact that the new service is a point-to-point
             service over the entire pipeline. The Board is not convinced that the
             change in ownership structure is material. The same two parties remain
             involved. For the last 20 years two corporate organizations have
             controlled and operated under a cooperative agreement the different
             sections of pipe. Under the new proposal that ownership is merged in a
             joint venture owned 50/50 by the same two corporate organizations”
             (paragraph 26);
         •   “The expansion of a provincially regulated lateral to enhance the ability
             to store gas serves a distribution purpose. We agree with Board Staff
             that functionally, the St. Clair Line, and its proposed extension to Dawn,
              is integral to an intraprovincial work or undertaking, namely, storage and
             distribution” (paragraph 40);
         •   “In our view, the proposed joint venture remains subject to provincial
             jurisdiction, save and except that aspect that has been previously
             declared to be federal. Put simply, the ownership change does not
             change jurisdiction. Nor does the jurisdiction change because a new
             class of service is now proposed” (paragraph 42);
         •   “It is clear the St. Clair Line is not itself an interprovincial or extra-
             provincial work. Nor does it form part of a single undertaking. The
             pipeline in this case will be owned and operated by separate corporate
             entities, Dawn Gateway LP in Canada and Dawn Gateway LLC in the
             US. As noted in Union’s argument, ‘even though there will only be one
             toll, shippers will enter two contracts, one for the portion of the Dawn
             Gateway pipeline in the US and another for the Canadian portion of the
             Dawn Gateway pipeline.’ ” (paragraph 45);
         •   “It should also be noted that Dawn Gateway LP and Dawn Gateway LLC
             are essentially post office boxes. It is apparent that these virtual
             partnerships and corporations will contract most, if not all, of the
             operations back to the parties that have been directly or indirectly
             undertaking those operations for the past two decades” (paragraph 48);
         •   “For the above reasons, the Board concludes that the St. Clair Line will
             continue to be under provincial jurisdiction following the proposed
             transaction, and that any extension of the line between Bickford and
             Dawn would also be subject to provincial jurisdiction” (paragraph 49).
These and other related findings have been made on the basis of a full evidentiary
record received as part of an oral public hearing process which included the
exchange of information requests between parties and cross-examination of
witnesses. Again, both Union Gas and Dawn Gateway were full participants in the
EB-2008-0411 process and are bound by its outcome. Unless and until the OEB’s
decision is reversed by the Ontario courts, the St. Clair Line continues in the
provincial jurisdiction regardless of the outcome of the NEB’s current consideration
of the jurisdiction issue.
Accordingly, on the basis of this decision and in view the position of both Union and
Dawn Gateway as noted by the OEB that the project will not proceed if the St. Clair
 Line remains in the provincial jurisdiction, GAPLO/CAEPLA respectfully submits
that Dawn Gateway’s pending application that is the subject of Hearing Order GH-2-
2009 should be dismissed. In these circumstances, we respectfully await the Board’s
further direction with respect to how the Board proposes to address the implications
of the OEB’s decision for its further consideration of Dawn Gateway’s pending
application.
Yours very truly,
COHEN HIGHLEY LLP

                                   DECISION AND ORDER
Background
[1]       On December 23, 2008, Union Gas Limited (“Union”) filed an application with the
Ontario Energy Board (the “OEB”) under section 43(1) of the Ontario Energy Board Act,
1998 seeking an order from the Board granting leave to sell 11.7 kilometers of 24 inch
diameter steel natural gas pipeline running between the St. Clair Valve Site and the
Bickford Compressor Site in the Township of St. Clair.
[2]       A Notice of Application dated February 3, 2009, was served and published by
Union Gas as directed by the Board. This included serving the Notice of Application on
all Aboriginal Groups that could be affected by the application. The following parties
                                                                          Ontario Energy Board
                                             -2-
were given intervenor status in this proceeding: Bluewater Gas Storage; Canadian
Manufacturers & Exporters (“CME”); Dawn Gateway Pipeline L.P. (“DGPL”); Enbridge
Gas Distribution Inc.; Federation of Rental-Housing Providers of Ontario (“FRPO”);
GAPLO-Union (a group of landowners) and the Canadian Association of Energy and
Pipeline Landowners’ Association and certain landowners who are affected directly by
the current application (collectively “GAPLO/CAEPLA”); Market Hub Partners Canada
L.P.; Shell Energy North America Inc.; St. Clair Pipelines L.P.; and TransCanada
Pipelines Limited (“TransCanada”). Nexen Marketing and Ontario Power Generation
were given observer status in this proceeding.
[3]    A Procedural Order was issued on March 16, 2009 containing a draft issues list.
Submissions were received from a number of parties and the Board established a final
issues list which is attached as Appendix A to this Decision. Included on the final issues
list was First Nations Consultation. No concerns were raised in this area so the Board
does not need to address that issue in this decision.
[4]    An oral hearing was held on June 22, 2009 and June 23, 2009.
[5]    On July 9, 2009, after the filing of Argument in Chief but before the filing of
intervenor arguments, the Board received a letter from CME requesting that a Notice of
Constitutional Question be served on the Attorney General of Canada and the Attorney
General of Ontario pursuant to section 109 of the Courts of Justice Act. The
Constitutional Question to be served was related to whether the Dawn Gateway project
should fall under the jurisdiction of National Energy Board or the Ontario Energy Board.
[6]    On July 10, the Board issued a Procedural Order inviting comments from all
intervenors on this question. Submissions were received from CME, GAPLO/CAEPLA,
Union, Board staff and DGPL. CME and GAPLO/CAEPLA argued that notice was
required. Union, Board staff, and DGPL argued that notice was not required. The Board
issued its Decision and Order on August 5, 2009 ordering Union to provide a Notice of
Constitutional Question to the Attorney General of Canada and the Attorney General of
Ontario regarding this proceeding pursuant to section 109 of the Courts of Justice Act.
On September 8, 2009 the Board received notice that the Attorney General of Canada
would not be intervening at this stage of the proceeding.
                                                                            Ontario Energy Board
                                             -3-
[7]      The Board in its August 5, 2009 Decision and Order also asked the parties to
make submissions as to whether the Board should add the following issue to the issues
list in this proceeding:
       “Should the Board consider establishing a form of regulatory treatment for the
       Dawn Gateway Line similar to the regulatory treatment that would be
       available to the pipeline under Federal jurisdiction and if so, what steps
       should the Board take to obtain the necessary evidence?”
Regarding the potential addition to the issues list, submissions were received from
Union, Dawn Gateway LP, CME, GAPLO/CAEPLA and FRPO.
[8]      A Procedural Order was issued on October 7, 2009, directing that Union
and / or DGPL file, in confidence, copies of Precedent Agreements with five
shippers, including information on the terms, volumes and prices. On October 9,
2009 Union requested that an exemption from the Procedural Order on the
grounds that the contracts requested are not the property of Union Gas. On
October 14, 2009 Dawn Gateway advised the Board that it considers the
requested information to be commercially sensitive and, while it is prepared to
provide the information, it requested that its circulation be restricted to the Board
and its staff.
[9]      The Board subsequently determined that access to the information contained in
the shippers’ contracts would be limited to the Board panel, Board staff and counsel for
CME, GAPLO/CAEPLA, and FRPO, as these were the active intervenors.
The Proposed Transaction
[10] The application seeks an order from the Board granting leave to sell 11.7
kilometers of 24 inch diameter steel natural gas pipeline running between the St. Clair
Valve Site and the Bickford Compressor Site in the Township of St. Clair (the “St. Clair
Line”). Union proposes to sell this line to Dawn Gateway LP, a limited partnership
owned jointly by Spectra Energy Corp. (“Spectra”) and DTE Pipeline Company (“DTE”)
through various affiliates. Union is a subsidiary of Spectra.
[11] Spectra and DTE have formed a joint venture to develop a 34 km pipeline (the
“Dawn Gateway pipeline”) that will commence at the Belle River Mills storage facility in
                                                                          Ontario Energy Board
                                            -4-
Michigan, owned by a DTE subsidiary, Michigan Consolidated Gas Company
(“Michcon”), and terminate at the Dawn Compressor Site in Ontario owned by Union.
[12] The Dawn Gateway pipeline will, when the transactions are completed, have four
components. The first three components are existing pipelines. The last component is
a new pipeline to be constructed by the joint venture. The components are identified in
the map attached as Appendix B.
[13] The first component is a 4.74 km pipeline owned by Michcon which runs from the
Belle River Mills compressor station in St. Clair County, Michigan, to the international
border between the United States and Canada in the middle of the St. Clair River.
Known as the Belle River Mills Pipeline, this pipeline is currently regulated by the
Michigan Public Service Commission. As part of this transaction this pipeline will be
leased to Dawn Gateway Pipeline LLC.
[14] The second component of the Dawn Gateway Line is .873 km of pipe presently
owned by St. Clair Pipelines LP which commences at the international border between
the United States and Canada in the St. Clair River and terminates at Union’s St. Clair
valve site in Lambton County, Ontario. Known as the St. Clair River Crossing, this line
is currently regulated by the NEB. St. Clair Pipelines LP is owned by Westcoast Energy
Inc. (which is a subsidiary of Spectra).
[15] The third component is the St. Clair Line, which is the subject of this proceeding.
The St. Clair Line is currently regulated by the Ontario Energy Board.
[16] The last component of the Dawn Gateway Line is a proposed new 17 km pipeline
running from the St. Clair Line near Union’s Bickford station to the Dawn Compressor
Station in Lambton County, Ontario.
[17] Union has requested that leave to complete the transaction be extended until
December 31, 2013 because it may take several years to complete all the steps
necessary to put the Dawn Gateway pipeline into service.
Jurisdiction
[18] Of significance to this proceeding is Union’s position that the Canadian segment
of the Dawn Gateway pipeline will be subject to federal jurisdiction and regulated by the
                                                                                        Ontario Energy Board
                                                     -5-
National Energy Board including the existing 11.7 km St. Clair Line currently regulated
by the Ontario Energy Board. On May 6, 2009 DTE and Spectra through DGPL filed an
application with the National Energy Board (“NEB”) which would give effect to this
change in jurisdiction. 1
[19] In this application Union is seeking leave to sell the St. Clair Line and related
assets to the DGPL at a price equal to net book value. The issues list sets out the
issues with respect to jurisdiction:
    1. If the proposed sale is approved should the St. Clair Line be under the
        jurisdiction of the OEB or the NEB?
    2. If the proposed Dawn Gateway Line is ultimately completed should it be under
        the jurisdiction of the OEB or the NEB?
[20] The Board in its decision on April 6, 2009, ruled that these issues should be
incorporated in the issues list despite the objections of Union. A month later DGPL
applied to the NEB asking that Board to approve the pipeline and assume jurisdiction.
Recently, the NEB issued a Letter of Direction indicating that it would, as a preliminary
matter, hear submissions regarding jurisdiction. As a result, the jurisdictional issue is
now before both Boards.
[21] Union argues in its reply argument that the OEB does not have jurisdiction to
determine whether the Dawn Gateway Pipeline should be under federal or provincial
jurisdiction. They say that the OEB does not have authority to assume jurisdiction over
pipelines yet to be built particularly where the proposed owner of that pipeline, DGLP,
has not made any application to the OEB. Union further states that it is not appropriate
for the OEB to determine this question because “there is simply no doubt that the
international transportation service that the Dawn Gateway joint-venture proposes to
offer is constitutionally required to be federally regulated.” 2
[22] The Board understands Union’s view that the St. Clair Line should become
subject to federal jurisdiction. That does not mean that this Board does not have
jurisdiction to decide this issue. Moreover, Union has put this issue in play. Both Union

and DGPL have indicated that the project is not likely to proceed unless the Board
agrees that the St. Clair Line should become federally regulated. The Board believes
that it has both the jurisdiction and the obligation to hear submissions and to make a
decision.
[23] In this case, the Board has a greater interest in the jurisdictional issue than might
otherwise be the case. That is because this Board has already issued a decision on
this issue regarding this pipeline. When this pipeline was first constructed almost 20
years ago, Union came before this Board requesting that the line be declared a
provincial undertaking. Union was opposed by TransCanada, an intervenor, which
argued for federal jurisdiction. The Board agreed with Union and ruled that the line
should be under provincial jurisdiction. 3 The Board was supported in that decision by
both the NEB 4 and the courts 5 , so understandably the Board asks the question, “What
has changed?”
[24] The intervenors say nothing has changed and note that the same parties will be
controlling the undertaking albeit through different subsidiaries. They also note that the
same service will be offered albeit through longer term contracts and a different
regulatory regime. Under the existing arrangements gas is moved from Belle River Mills
in St. Clair County, Michigan to Dawn in Lambton County, Ontario. Under the joint
venture, the gas will follow the same path although the new pipeline will increase the
capacity over the last 17 kilometers.
[25] The only federal undertaking is St. Clair Pipeline LP which is less than a
kilometer in length commencing at the international border in the middle of the St. Clair
River and terminating at Union’s St. Clair Valve site in Lambton County. The existing
St. Clair Line which is 11.7 km and the proposed new section of line which is 17 km are
not integral or essential to the St. Clair River crossing. Nor have they ever been. It is
also worth noting that this is not the first time that Union has proposed a new pipe
running from Bickford to Dawn. Union applied to the Board for leave to construct a

In that decision the NEB stated, “the Ontario Divisional Court dismissed TransCanada PipeLines’
application for leave to appeal. The Court provided brief reasons by way of written endorsement on the
record. The Court stated that the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Canada in Kootenay and Elk
Railway Company v. Burlington Northern Inc. was dispositive of the issue.

similar pipeline in 1993 which was turned down when the Board determined that there
was no economic justification for the proposed facility. 6 There was no indication then
that the new line should fall within federal jurisdiction.
[26] At the end of the day, the Union and DGPL arguments rely on the new ownership
structure and the fact that the new service is a point-to-point service over the entire
pipeline. The Board is not convinced that the change in ownership structure is material.
The same two parties remain involved. For the last 20 years two corporate
organizations have controlled and operated under a cooperative agreement the different
sections of pipe. Under the new proposal that ownership is merged in a joint venture
owned 50/50 by the same two corporate organizations.
[27] It is true there are operational changes and one party has been designated the
main sales representative. And, the new service will become a point-to-point service
running the entire length of the pipe. The intervenors argued that this is not material
and the change in business operations could have easily been achieved under the old
structure. The intervenors also argue that the form of regulation that the joint-venture
hopes to attain from the NEB could have been obtained from the OEB. The Board
agrees with that proposition as well but that really is a side issue to be addressed later.
The form of regulation is not determinative of whether an undertaking is under federal or
provincial jurisdiction.
[28] Section 92(10) of the Constitution Act, 1867 provides generally that local works
and undertakings within a province come within provincial jurisdiction. However, the
combined effects of sections 91 and 29 create an exception whereby Parliament has
exclusive jurisdiction for works and undertakings that come within the phrase “Lines of
steam or other ships, railways, canals, telegraphs and other works and undertakings
connecting the province with any other or others of the provinces, or extending beyond
the limits of the province.”
[29] Pipelines, although not specifically mentioned in section 92(10), have been held
to be included in the phrase “other works and undertakings.” 7 In the Central Western

Railway case, 8 Chief Justice Dickson set out the two basic tests used in constitutional
analysis of pipeline jurisdiction: the “physical connection” test and the “vital, integral or
essential” test. On pages 1124-1125 of Central Western Railway, the Chief Justice
stated;
       “There are two ways in which Central Western may be found to fall within
       federal jurisdiction… First, it may be seen as an interprovincial railway and
       therefore come under section 92(10)(a) as a federal work or undertaking.
       Second, if the appellant can be properly viewed as integral to an existing
       federal work or undertaking it would be subject to federal jurisdiction under
       section 92(10)(a). For clarity, I should point out that these two approaches,
       though not unrelated, are distinct from one another. For the former, the
       emphasis must be on determining whether the railway is itself an
       interprovincial work or undertaking. Under the latter, however, Jurisdiction is
       dependant upon a finding that regulation of the subject matter in question is
       integral to a core federal work or undertaking.”
[30] The fact that a provincial undertaking touches a federal or international
undertaking does not always convert a provincial work into a work under federal
jurisdiction as the Chief Justice stated at page 1129:
       “Railways, by their nature, form a network across provincial and national
       boundaries. As a consequence, purely local railways may very well “touch”,
       either directly or indirectly, upon a federally regulated work or undertaking.
       That fact alone, however, cannot reasonably be sufficient to turn the local
       railway into an interprovincial work or undertaking within the meaning of
       section 92(10)(a) of the Constitution Act 1867. Furthermore, if the physical
       connection between the rail lines were a sufficient basis for federal
       jurisdiction, it would be difficult to envision a rail line that could be provincial in
       nature: most rail lines located within a province do connect eventually with
       interprovincial lines.”
[31] In the Cyanamid case 9 , the Federal Court of Appeal considered the issue of
control and found that, despite the physical connection of a proposed provincial pipeline

owned by Cyanamid Canada Limited to the existing federal pipeline of TransCanada
PipeLines, TransCanada would have limited control over the proposed pipeline and
therefore the provincial line would not be subject to federal jurisdiction. Another key
distinction was that the proposed pipeline was not necessary for the operation of
TransCanada PipeLines.
[32] This type of analysis was the basis of this Board’s decision in 1988 that the St.
Clair Line was subject to provincial jurisdiction. The Board stated at Page 126:
      “The NEB will control gas exports out of Canada and gas imports into
      Canada, including tolls and service, totally, whether the link is 100 feet or 100
      miles in length. The jurisdiction of the NEB is served and reserved by limiting
      its jurisdiction between two points: the international border near the centre of
      the St. Clair River and the St. Clair Valve Site as proposed by Union.
      If the NEB were to have jurisdiction easterly beyond the short, river crossing
      link, where would its jurisdiction end, and for what reason? If not at the
      proposed valve site, then where? How far east into the bowels of the Union
      system should the NEB’s jurisdiction extend?
      In the Board’s view, any attempt to extend the jurisdiction of the NEB east of
      the proposed valve site will cause serious and unnecessary economic, legal,
      political, and jurisdictional problems…” 10
[33] In determining the degree of operational integration necessary to convert a local
work or undertaking to a work or undertaking that is part of the “Classes” identified in
section 92(10) of the Constitution Act, generally requires that the integration be “vital or
essential” to the operation of the interprovincial undertaking. 11

[34] This principle was also relied upon by this Board in the Bypass case 12 . Industrial
companies seeking to reduce their transportation costs wanted to build their own
pipelines bypassing the facilities of the gas distribution utilities, and connect directly to
TransCanada. The question was the bypass facilities were under Ontario or federal
jurisdiction.
[35] The Board ruled that the bypass pipelines were subject to Ontario jurisdiction
because they had no direct effect on the operation of TransCanada’s pipeline or any
material impact on the quantity of the product that would be transported by
TransCanada. 13 The Board then stated a case to the Divisional Court, which confirmed
that jurisdiction remains with the Province. 14 At the same time, the Federal Court
reviewed a decision of the NEB, which authorized the construction of a bypass pipeline,
and also found that the NEB had no jurisdiction over the bypass pipeline for essentially
the same reasons.
[36] In the same time frame, the OEB stated a case to the Divisional Court to
determine whether the OEB had jurisdiction over the proposed construction of LNG
facilities by Consumers’ Gas, a predecessor to Enbridge. This facility, like the bypass
pipeline, required an interconnection with the TransCanada line. It was argued that the
NEB had jurisdiction because of the physical connection and the operational integration
between the two enterprises creating an interprovincial work or an undertaking within
clause 92(10) of the Constitution Act. The Divisional Court ruled that although
connected to the TransCanada system the Consumers’ Gas proposal was a local work
because it would not become an integral part of the TransCanada system. 15
[37] The factual situation in this proceeding is also dramatically different than the
Westcoast case 16 on which Union relies. Westcoast was clearly an international

pipeline subject to federal jurisdiction. The question was whether additional facilities
that were being connected to that pipeline became federal as a result of the connection.
The Court found that the incremental facilities were integral to the federal undertaking
and had common ownership and management. The decision was not simply based on
common ownership and management; it was based in large part on the fact that the
incremental facilities were an integral part of an existing federal undertaking.
[38] Westcoast had applied for orders from the NEB regarding expansions of its
gathering pipeline and processing plant in Fort St. John. The NEB held that the
proposed facilities were not federal works or undertakings and dismissed Westcoast’s
application for lack of jurisdiction. On appeal, the Federal Court of Appeal held that the
Fort St. John facilities were part of a single federal transportation undertaking within the
jurisdiction of Parliament. That decision was upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada.
The Supreme Court repeated the established rule that undertakings may come under
federal jurisdiction in one of two ways: (1) if they constitute a single federal work or
undertaking or (2) if not, they are integral to the core federal transportation
communication facility. The Court noted that they must be functionally integrated and
subject to common management control and direction.
[39] Another decision with facts similar to the case before us is the Federal Court of
Appeal’s decision in Consumers Gas Co. v. Canada (National Energy Board). 17 There
the Court rejected the NEB’s conclusion that the Ottawa East Line of the Ottawa
distribution system of Consumers Gas would be subject to federal regulatory
jurisdiction. In setting aside the NEB Order, the Court recognized that the Ottawa East
Line was and always had been an integral part of Consumers’ Ottawa distribution
system, just as the St. Clair Line, in this case, is and always has been an integral part of
Union’s integrated distribution, transmission, and storage system.
[40] The proposed extension from Bickford to Dawn will enhance the ability of the St.
Clair Line to carry gas from the St. Clair Crossing to Union’s storage system at Dawn for
ultimate distribution throughout the province. The expansion of a provincially regulated
lateral to enhance the ability to store gas serves a distribution purpose. We agree with
Board Staff that functionally, the St. Clair Line, and its proposed extension to Dawn, is
integral to an intraprovincial work or undertaking, namely, storage and distribution.

[41] In the Board’s view it is important to distinguish between cases where there is an
existing federal undertaking that connects to a new facility. In that case the question is
whether the new facility is a totally distinct business or integral to the operation of the
existing federal undertaking. It is a different matter where there is an existing provincial
undertaking and the only change is in the ownership structure. This is particularly the
case where the existing owners continue but through a different vehicle such as a joint
venture. On that basis, any provincial undertaking can be converted to a federal
undertaking.
[42] In our view, the proposed joint venture remains subject to provincial jurisdiction,
save and except that aspect that has been previously declared to be federal. Put
simply, the ownership change does not change jurisdiction. Nor does the jurisdiction
change because a new class of service is now proposed.
[43] Of particular significance to this case is the Supreme Court of Canada decision in
1972 in Kootenay. 18 In that case Burlington, a US Company, constructed a short line to
the US-Canada border and Kootenay, a B.C. Company, proposed to construct a line to
connect with the Burlington line just north of the Border. Under the arrangement,
Burlington would own and operate facilities south of the border and Kootenay would
own and operate the facilities north of the border. The Court in holding that the
Kootenay line was not part of an extraprovincial undertaking stated;
      “[Kootenay] is not a subsidiary of Burlington or subject to Burlington’s control.
      Its railway would not be operated by Burlington. Its proposed function is to
      deliver carloads of coal over its line to Burlington, north of the border [for
      extra-provincial transport by Burlington as its only purpose]…
      …Kootenay Railway would not connect the province of British Columbia and
      any other province, nor would it extend beyond the limits of the province…” 19
[44] Within the context of the Kootenay case it is important to consider the following
facts:

    1. The first component of this project is a 4.74 km pipeline owned by Michcon, a
        subsidiary of DTE, which runs from the Belle River Mills compressor station in St.
        Clair County Michigan and terminates at the international border between the
        United States and Canada in the middle of the St. Clair River. This pipeline is
        currently regulated by Michigan Public Service Commission and will continue to
        be so regulated. Note Union is not a subsidiary of DTE or subject to DTE’s
        control.
    2. The function of the St. Clair Line has been and will continue to be to transport
        Michigan gas to Ontario. The Board has already determined this function is part
        of the Union system and not an integral part of the short international pipeline.
    3. The St. Clair Line does not connect Ontario with any other province or extend
        beyond the limits of the province.
[45] It is clear the St. Clair Line is not itself an interprovincial or extra-provincial work.
Nor does it form part of a single undertaking. The pipeline in this case will be owned
and operated by separate corporate entities, Dawn Gateway LP in Canada and Dawn
Gateway LLC in the US. As noted in Union’s argument, “even though there will only be
one toll, shippers will enter two contracts, one for the portion of the Dawn Gateway
pipeline in US and another for the Canadian portion of the Dawn Gateway pipeline.” 20
[46] This ownership is different from the Westcoast case where Westcoast owned
and operated the gathering lines as well as the processing and transmission facilities.
And in the decision on TransCanada’s Alberta System, TransCanada owned and
operated both the provincial and interprovincial facilities. Common ownership is an
important aspect of the concept of common ownership and control. It is also important
to recognize that the Belle River Mills line remains under the ownership of Michcon.
This is very different from both the Westcoast and the TransCanada Alberta System
cases.
[47] The Board also notes that Westcoast and TransCanada operated very
substantial interprovincial pipelines. That is not the case here. The only interprovincial
component is the St. Clair River Crossing, which is less than a kilometer long and
connected on the US side to a line under State jurisdiction. The Board would add the
20
   Union Argument in Chief, Pg. 5.
                                                                                      Ontario Energy Board
                                                   - 14 -
St. Clair Line is not integral to the St. Clair River Crossing. Rather, it is integral to the
Dawn storage facilities, a very important provincial asset.
[48] It should also be noted that Dawn Gateway LP and Dawn Gateway LLC are
essentially post office boxes. It is apparent that these virtual partnerships and
corporations will contract most, if not all, of the operations back to the parties that have
been directly or indirectly undertaking those operations for the past two decades. The
one exception appears to be the appointment of a single sales agent.
[49] For the above reasons, the Board concludes that the St. Clair Line will continue
to be under provincial jurisdiction following the proposed transaction, and that any
extension of the line between Bickford and Dawn would also be subject to provincial
jurisdiction.
[50] Having determined the issue of jurisdiction, the Board will now consider whether
the proposed transaction is in the public interest.
What is the Appropriate Test for the Transaction?
[51] The Applicant has the burden of proof in this case but what does it have to prove
in order to demonstrate that this transaction is in the public interest? Union says the
Board should adopt the “no-harm test” used in the Joint MAADs case. 21 There the
Board stated at page 6:
       “The Board believes that the “no harm” test is the appropriate test. It provides
       greater certainty and, most importantly, in the context of share acquisition and
       amalgamation applications it is the test that best lends itself to the objectives
       of the Board as set out in section 1 of the Act. The Board is of the view that its
       mandate in these matters is to consider whether the transaction that has been
       placed before it will have an adverse effect relative to the status quo in terms
       of the Board’s statutory objectives. It is not to determine whether another
       transaction, whether real or potential, can have a more positive effect than the

      one that has been negotiated to completion by the parties. In that sense, in
      section 86 applications of this nature the Board equates ‘protecting the
      interests of consumers’ with ensuring that there is ‘no harm to consumers.’”
[52] The Joint MAADs case, however, is significantly different from this proceeding.
In the Joint MAADs case, the Board was asked to approve mergers and acquisitions by
three different groups of utilities. In some cases, the citizens opposed the deals that
had been approved by the municipal councils that owned the utilities. The Gravenhurst
Hydro Citizen’s Committee, for example, said that the appropriate test was the “best
result” or “best deal” test. They said the Board should consider whether consumers
would have been better off with other options that were considered by the seller.
[53] The Board in the Joint MAADs case concluded that it was not necessary to look
at other deals whether they were actually on the table or whether they were
opportunities that had not been explored. Rather, the Board would look at the deal that
was approved by the council and determine if there was any adverse impact on the
public.
[54] The Board does not see any reason to depart from the no harm test, but notes
that in any particular case, the determination by the Board of whether there is harm
requires a comparison of the effect of the proposed transaction to the status quo.
[55]    Keeping these factors in mind, the Board has considered the following questions:
    •   Would there be benefits as a result of the asset sale?
    •   Would there be harm to the integrity, reliability, and operational flexibility of
        Union’s system?
    •   Would there be harm to potential future distribution customers seeking
        connection to Union?
    •   Would there be harm to Ontario’s gas market as a result of the sale?
    •   Would there be harm to landowners?
    •   Would there be harm to ratepayers as a result of the asset sale?
[56] The Board addresses each question below. Further, to the extent the Board
finds there is harm, the Board also examines whether it can be mitigated in a way that
would allow the transaction to proceed. In relation to that, a relevant consideration is
that this is a non-arm’s length transaction.
                                                                                  Ontario Energy Board
                                                - 16 -
Would there be benefits as a result of the asset sale?
[57] Union submits that there will be clear benefits from the transaction: the removal
of an under-utilized asset from ratebase and the creation of an additional transportation
link between Michigan storage and Dawn offering point-to-point firm service, including
long-term service at negotiated fixed rates. None of the parties dispute these benefits.
Board Findings
[58] The Board accepts that there will be benefits from the transaction. There will be
two types of benefits: direct and indirect. The direct benefit is the rate reduction
resulting from removing the asset, which is currently under-utilized, from ratebase and
rates. This benefit is small; the estimated rate impact is less than $1 per year for
residential customers in the Southern Operations Area.
[59] The indirect benefits are more significant and flow from the broader project,
including the expansion of capacity from Bickford to Dawn. These benefits include
enhanced transportation capacity between Michigan storage and Dawn and enhanced
access to supply. These benefits have the potential to lead to greater liquidity and
reduced price volatility at the Dawn Hub. The proposed Dawn Gateway pipeline would
have a capacity of 385,000 GJ/d on a firm basis, and that capacity could be expanded.
Although these indirect benefits rely on projections, there are already five Precedent
Agreements in place, thereby demonstrating that the enhanced access is desired by the
marketplace.
[60] These broader benefits echo the benefits identified by the Board in the original
St. Clair Line proceeding:
      “The Board finds that the proposed facilities will contribute to a more
      competitive and open gas supply market, wherein both Union and its storage
      and transportation customers will have increased bargaining power,
      purchasing options, flexibility and strengthened back-up supplies.” 22

Would there be harm to the integrity, reliability, and operational flexibility of
Union’s system?
[61] Union serves distribution customers in the area of the St. Clair Line from the
Sarnia Industrial Line. Union submitted that the transaction would have no negative
impact on the operations of the Sarnia Industrial Line, or to the Union system generally.
Union explained that it used the St. Clair Line as an emergency backstop supply in the
event of failure on the TransCanada line, but that the need was reduced since 2005
when the Vector Line was connected. The Dawn Gateway pipeline would remain
available for emergency purposes. Because of the greater capacity of the Dawn
Gateway pipeline, Union concluded that security of supply would be enhanced.
[62] Board staff expressed concern that any service to the Sarnia Industrial Line from
the Dawn Gateway pipeline, if available, would only be available at negotiated rates.
Board staff submitted that the asset sale could result in harm to the operations of the
Sarnia Industrial Line. CME did not agree with Board staff’s analysis and submitted that
there was unlikely to be any adverse effect on system integrity, security of supply or
design day capability.
[63] Union responded that the Sarnia Industrial Line is connected to the Vector and
TransCanada transmission systems and the Dow A and Heritage storage pools and
does not need a connection to the Dawn Gateway pipeline to service its customers on a
design day. Union went on to explain that the Sarnia Industrial Line will remain
connected to the St. Clair Line in any event and would therefore be able to receive gas
from the Dawn Gateway pipeline on an emergency basis.
Board Findings
[64] The evidence is clear that the Sarnia Industrial Line does not require a feed from
the Dawn Gateway pipeline for design day operations. It already has multiple feeds
(TransCanada, Vector, Dow A and Heritage). It could be argued that the asset sale will
result in diminished security compared to the situation today because currently there is
a connection to the St. Clair Line that is under Union’s direct ownership and control.
However, the Board finds that this harm is not material given the level of security on the
Sarnia Industrial Line already. The Board also notes that in an emergency, all
transmission system operators work to ensure overall security, regardless of ownership.
                                                                              Ontario Energy Board
                                               - 18 -
[65] The Board concludes that the transaction will not result in harm to the integrity,
reliability or operational flexibility of Union’s system.
Would there be harm to potential future distribution customers seeking
connection to Union?
[66] No distribution customers are connected to the St. Clair Line; no distribution
customers have ever been connected to the line. Union has a distribution network in
the same municipality which is used to serve distribution customers.
[67] Board staff expressed concern that the transaction could negatively affect a large
customer seeking a high pressure connection, because service from the Dawn Gateway
pipeline would not be available at cost-based rates. FRPO agreed with staff’s concerns.
CME was of the view that there would be no adverse effect on Union’s ability to connect
customers near the St. Clair Line. CME submitted that as a regulated utility Dawn
Gateway would have an obligation to serve and therefore a customer or Union could
obtain regulatory approval to connect distribution lines to the Dawn Gateway pipeline if
necessary.
[68] Union responded that Board staff’s concern was based on conjecture and
maintained that a large customer seeking high pressure connection would be able to
connect to the Dawn Gateway pipeline or the Union system.
Board Findings
[69] The Board finds that the transaction will not result in harm to potential future
distribution customers. Union has an obligation to connect. For the subject area, all
large load distribution customers are connected to the Sarnia Industrial Line. The Board
notes that 25% of the St. Clair Line is within a short distance of the Sarnia Industrial
Line, so for that portion of the line there is unlikely to be a material difference in the cost
to connect customers between the Sarnia Industrial Line and the St. Clair Line.
[70] The only potential for harm would be if a customer’s connection costs were
higher because it had to connect to the Sarnia Industrial Line rather than the St. Clair
Line in order to get service. The Board cautions Union that if a distribution customer’s
connection costs were expected to be higher as a result of having to connect to the
Sarnia Industrial Line rather than the St. Clair Line, then the Board may require Union to
                                                                           Ontario Energy Board
                                             - 19 -
absorb that higher cost and instead provide connection for the customer based on the
notional lower cost.
[71] The Board also notes that a customer might choose to connect to the Dawn
Gateway pipeline if it could negotiate suitable arrangements; this would provide another
option for the customer.
Would there be harm to Ontario’s gas market as a result of the sale?
[72] The sale of the St. Clair Line would result in the discontinuation of Union’s
current services on the line, namely C1 transportation service and various Hub services.
Union submitted that shippers would be able to receive services from the Dawn
Gateway pipeline or via the other available transportation links. Union noted that over
the last three years, 81% of the firm volumes on the St. Clair Line have been
transported for DTE affiliates.
[73] Intervenor submissions focused on the impact of shifting from OEB to NEB
jurisdiction and the potential implications for the market due to the differences in
regulatory approach. Concerns were expressed primarily regarding non-discriminatory
access to the pipeline and related matters such as disclosure. There was no allegation
that there would be harm to Ontario’s gas market as a result of the sale if the OEB were
to retain jurisdiction.
Board Findings
[74] While C1 service will no longer be available on the line, there has been limited
use of these services in any event and the primary users have been DTE affiliates. The
Board finds that there will be no material harm from the cessation of these services.
[75] The Board concludes that there would be no harm to the Ontario gas market as a
result of the transaction. The Board will regulate Dawn Gateway in the public interest
and in accordance with the Board’s statutory objectives.
Would there be harm to landowners?
[76] The submissions focused on the impact of shifting from OEB to NEB jurisdiction
and the implications for landowners due to the differences in regulatory approach.
                                                                                     Ontario Energy Board
                                                - 20 -
There were no allegations that there would be harm to landowners if the OEB retained
jurisdiction.
Board Findings
[77] The Board concludes that there will be no harm to landowners from the
transaction as the line will remain under the Board’s regulation. The alternative, namely
if the NEB is ultimately found to have jurisdiction for the line, is addressed later in the
decision.
Would there be harm to ratepayers as a result of the asset sale?
[78] Union is seeking leave to sell the St. Clair Line to the Dawn Gateway joint
venture at net book value, which is approximately $5.2 million. There would be
corresponding adjustments to Union’s ratebase and rates at its next rebasing
application. Rates for Union’s residential customers in the Southern Operations Area
will decline slightly because the costs currently allocated to the line exceed the
revenues earned on the line. In other words, ratepayers are currently subsidizing the
line because it is underutilized.
[79] Union does not propose that ratepayers would receive any net gain as a result of
the sale because there will be no capital gain on the sale and the proceeds only
represent the return of the shareholder’s investment. Union further argued that even if
the sale were done at greater than net book value, the capital gain would be entirely for
the shareholder under the principles of the Supreme Court of Canada’s ATCO
decision 23 because ratepayers do not have an ownership interest in the asset, and
there are no other facts which justify a sharing of any gain.
[80] Union and DGPL both argued that the rate reduction is a benefit to ratepayers
and that there is no harm to ratepayers. Board staff and intervenors argued that while
there is small financial benefit, there is significant harm to ratepayers as a result of the
transaction. Further, because the sale is to be made at net book value, there is no gain
to be allocated to ratepayers to mitigate the harm.

(“ATCO”).
                                                                              Ontario Energy Board
                                               - 21 -
[81] CME argued that the harm arises from the fact that ratepayers will derive no
benefit from the future revenues earned on the line:
      “This proposal deprives Union’s ratepayers of future increased utilization
      benefits attributable to the St. Clair Line to which they are entitled under the
      well established regulatory principle requiring utility owner to maximize the
      value of under-utilized utility assets for the benefit of their ratepayers.” 24
CME submitted that Union’s Transactional Services provides an apt analogy and noted
that ratepayers receive 90% of the revenues earned from theses services.
[82] Union disagreed with CME’s position that the utility has an obligation to maximize
the value of its utility assets for the benefit of its ratepayers. In Union’s view, its
obligation is to provide service at just and reasonable rates and to act in the interest of
its customers. Union pointed out that Transactional Services (and the sharing of those
revenues) relate to temporarily underutilized utility assets and short-term transactions
and that ratepayers continue to bear the costs of the assets. Union argued that the St.
Clair Line is not needed to provide regulated utility service to Union’s customers and
that once it is sold there can be no requirement on the new owner to maximize its use
for benefit of Union’s customers.
Board Findings
[83] It was undisputed during the hearing that ratepayers have been subsidizing the
line for some time; the St. Clair Line has had a negative rate of return for six years. The
cumulative subsidy has been significant; total operating costs alone have exceeded net
revenues by approximately $1.8 million between 2003 and 2008. Indeed Union has
characterized the removal of this underutilized asset as one of the benefits of the
proposed transaction.
[84] In Board staff’s view, “It appears that the pipeline has largely failed to meet the
business and service objectives that Union advanced when the pipeline was approved
by the Board and added to rate base in 1989.” 25

                                              - 22 -
[85]    However, Union in its Reply Argument raised a further consideration:
      “Union’s evidence in the 1988 proceeding indicates that the incremental
      construction costs of the St. Clair Line would be more than recouped in
      savings on gas costs in less than 2 years after construction. Accordingly,
      Board Staff and the Intervenors’ assertion that ratepayers have paid higher
      rates in the past because of the historic under-utilization of the St. Clair Line
      is an incorrect, over-simplification of the true facts.” 26
[86] DGPL makes a similar argument, noting that the Board estimated a six year
payout for the project, which is long past, and that Board staff have not referenced or
attributed any value from reduced gas supply costs to its analysis.
[87] Past ratepayers may well have achieved benefits from reduced gas costs as a
result of the construction of the St. Clair Line. However, the asset remains used and
useful and therefore remains in ratebase and in rates. The fact is that the line is under-
utilized and has been for some time, and because the costs of the line exceed the
revenues, Union’s ratepayers have been paying higher rates to ensure that Union
continues to earn its full return on the asset and that all costs are recovered.
[88] The line is being sold as part of an overall reorganization to achieve one of the
original objectives identified by Union, namely a firm seamless service between
Michigan storage and Dawn.
[89] Union has emphasized that the original purpose of the St. Clair Line was to
provide enhanced security of supply and diversity of supply for Union’s distribution
business. However, a review of the Board’s decision in that application demonstrates
that at that time Union also claimed benefits related to Union’s transportation services to
and from Dawn, including services for other distributors. The Board clearly found that
there were benefits of the project related to the Ontario gas market generally:
      ”The Board finds that the proposed facilities will contribute to a more
      competitive and open gas supply market, wherein both Union and its storage
26
   Union’s Reply Argument, p. 38.
                                                                                  Ontario Energy Board
                                                 - 23 -
       and transportation customers will have increased bargaining power,
       purchasing options, flexibility and strengthened back-up supplies.” 27
[90]     GAPLO/CAEPLA summarized the situation well:
       “In summary, what Union now proposes as the Dawn Gateway Line has the
       same purpose and is to provide the same benefits as proposed by Union in
       1988 and achieved by the St. Clair Line since that time – a source of gas to
       Union’s distribution system through interconnection to American facilities to
       access additional supplies and storage. Under Union’s Dawn Gateway
       proposal, there will be no change in the function of the St. Clair Line. The
       proposed expansion in capacity between Bickford and Dawn by substituting
       the new Bickford to Dawn line for the Bickford Storage Pool line is simply
       providing the additional capacity which was anticipated in 1988 because
       additional storage and transportation needs have “materialized.” 28
[91] Under the status quo, ratepayers would have expected benefits if the capacity
expansion project were done as part of Union’s regulated business, as has always been
contemplated when market conditions permit. At a minimum, the subsidy would have
been recouped and quite possibly there would have been a net contribution to rates.
There would also be the potential for Transactional Services-type sharing of revenues if
there were opportunities to earn additional revenues on a short-term basis. The Board
agrees that this is an important aspect of the status quo. Ratepayers will receive no
financial benefit from the ongoing business if it is not part of Union’s regulated business.
[92] The Board concludes that the transaction does result in harm to ratepayers. The
harm is the inability of ratepayers to recoup the cumulative past subsidy since 2003
through future revenues. The harm arises because Union intends to do outside the
utility what it originally intended to do within the utility. The asset is not being sold to be
used for an entirely different purpose; it is being sold to a utility and will continue to be
used for utility service – the very service it was originally expected to provide.

[93] The Board further finds, however, that this harm can be mitigated through an
appropriate allocation to ratepayers upon completion of the transaction based on a fair
market value for the asset. This issue is addressed next.
What is the remedy for the harm to ratepayers?
[94] The parties proposed a variety of remedies. One proposal was that the
cumulative subsidy should be returned to ratepayers.
[95] DGPL questioned whether a refund of past tolls was lawful and noted that the net
book value is already greater than fair market value estimated for the line. Dawn
Gateway argued that in line with ATCO principles, customers are not entitled to
recovery of past rates from the proceeds of sale of utility assets.
[96] Another proposal was that that the Board should impute the value of the asset at
replacement cost and allocate a portion of the value to Union’s ratepayers.
[97]    CME provided a comprehensive proposal based on future use of the line:
      “The sale of the St. Clair Line to the JV should be approved on terms that
      prevent ratepayer harm by calling for a significant allocation of discounted
      future utilization benefits attributable to the St. Clair Line to Union’s
      ratepayers.” 29
[98] CME submitted that what the Board must do is determine “the method to be
applied after the transaction has been completed to derive the value that should be
allocated to ratepayers to prevent ratepayer harm.” 30 CME proposed that the valuation
concept should reflect the present value of the stream of net revenues that will be
realized from the significantly increased utilization of the St. Clair Line, what CME
termed “future utilization benefits.” CME submitted that the final amount can not be
determined at this time, because Union did not file the necessary evidence on the net
revenues, but that the determination could be done in a subsequent proceeding.

                                               - 25 -
[99] CME presented some high level estimates of the potential magnitude of the
“future utilization benefits” of the St. Clair Line ranging from $16.6 million to $25 million.
CME submitted that Union should be required to provide an independent estimate of the
present value of the future utilization benefits which can be tested along with other
indications of value after which the Board can determine the allocation to ratepayers.
CME further argued that Dawn Gateway would be required to provide any evidence it
wished to rely on that a higher return is warranted for the risk that Dawn Gateway is
bearing and that otherwise ratepayers should be allocated between 90% and 100% of
the present value of the future utilization benefits.
[100] CME pointed out that this was not the disposition of “non-utility” assets; it is the
transfer of utility assets from one utility to another in order to increase the utilization.
This, in CME’s view, makes it wholly different than the circumstances in ATCO. CME
also pointed out that the Board has determined in another case that the allocation may
be greater than net book value if there is demonstrated harm to customers. CME also
suggested that the Board should consider taking action if the transaction is not
completed – and to signal its intention to do so in this decision. FRPO supported CME’s
approach.
[101] Union responded that it is unreasonable to expect Union to sell the asset without
knowing the financial consequences of the transaction and that it has no way of
knowing in advance the outcome the determination contemplated by CME. In Union’s
view, “no reasonable entity would ever agree to a sale without knowing the financial
impacts of that sale.” 31 Union further responded that the threat of subsequent rate
sanctions if the transaction is not completed is also unreasonable.
Board Findings
[102] The Board acknowledges that Union cannot be ordered to sell the asset at a
different value from what it has negotiated. However, the transaction is not taking place
at arm’s length. Where a transaction has not taken place at fair market value, the Board
has the power to modify the transaction price for rate setting purposes. Further, the
Board has the power to allocate a portion of the proceeds based on fair market value to
ratepayers where the transaction will harm ratepayers.

   Union Reply Argument, p. 38.
                                                                                     Ontario Energy Board
                                                - 26 -
[103] Intervenors argued that the price should be fair market value, which they believe
is above net book value and should include some share of future revenue. Union and
Dawn Gateway respond that this is not a meaningful argument because the Board has
no jurisdiction under the ATCO decision of the Supreme Court of Canada 32 to allocate
any part of the gains (if any gains exist) to the ratepayers.
[104] It is true that ATCO clearly established that ratepayers have no entitlement to the
property of the utility. They are entitled only to service at just and reasonable rates. It is
important to note however that ATCO was not a rate case. Justice Bastarache’s
comments in that case distinguish rate cases from other regulatory proceedings and
made it clear that if ATCO had been a rate case, the Alberta regulator would have been
“fully authorized to consider the treatment or effect of the proceeds from the sale.” 33
[105] The Ontario Energy Board has very broad powers in exercising its rate setting
responsibility. As the Court stated in Garland v. Consumers’ Gas Company:
      The purpose behind the Ontario Energy Board Act, both in its current and
      past form, is clear. The Act provides a detailed and comprehensive scheme
      upon which the Energy Board relies in order for it to carry out its very specific
      objectives. Rate setting is at the core of the Energy Board’s jurisdiction. […]
      In addition to providing the Energy Board with guidelines, the OEBA provides
      the Board with specific and broad ranging powers. Pursuant to section 36(2)
      of the current Act, the OEB may make orders approving or fixing just and
      reasonable rates for the sale, distribution, and storage of gas. Subsection
      36(7) authorizes the Board to fix or approve such rates of its own motion or
      upon the request of the Minister. In addition to the provisions outlining the
      Board’s expansive rate making power, section 23 of the current Act is an
      expression of the provincial legislature’s intention to bestow upon the OEB
      broad powers, which allow the Board to attach conditions to its orders as a
      means to fashioning effective and far reaching decisions. 34

[106] The Board’s recent decision in the Cushion Gas case 35 , where Union sought to
retain for its shareholders the proceeds from the sale of cushion gas from a storage
facility, is an example. The Board agreed and ordered that 100% of the proceeds
should go to the shareholder because this was a surplus asset and there was no harm
to the ratepayer.
[107] There are however a number of cases where the Board has allocated a portion of
the proceeds of sales of capital property to ratepayers, including a sale of land by
Consumers’ Gas (now Enbridge) in 1991 36 , the sale of land by Enbridge in 2003 37 , the
sale of land by Natural Resources Gas in 2004 38 and the sale of cushion gas in 2003. 39
[108] The recent Toronto Hydro 40 decision confirms that the Board has broad
discretion when exercising its ratemaking authority, to allocate to ratepayers a share of
the gains on the sale of utility assets. The Divisional Court upheld the Board decision
which allocated 100% of the after tax gains from the sale of certain properties to the
ratepayer. The Board found the properties would continue to be used and useful and
would be replaced by other facilities at a substantial cost to the ratepayer. The Court
stated in part;
       The appellants were seeking a significant increase in the rates. The OEB
       expressed concern about the increase of operating and capital expenditures
       and the impact on ratepayers. The OEB decision, quoted above, referred to
       the need to replace the properties with other facilities, at a substantial cost the
       ratepayer and concluded; “To defray these substantial costs to the ratepayer,
       the Board finds that 100% of the net after tax gains from the sale of the
       properties should go to the ratepayer. The Company’s revenue requirement

      for the 2008 test year shall be adjusted downward by $10.3 million to reflect
      these findings.”
      Read in the context of the rate setting process as a whole, and the allocation
      of revenue to the formula used by the OEB in the decision, it is clear that the
      OEB was not granting the ratepayers a property interest in the capital gains
      from the sale of the properties but was allocating a revenue offset – in a
      similar treatment to revenue from other sources – to adjust revenue
      requirements of THESL for the 2008 year. The OEB also considered the need
      to replace the functions of that property and the costs to the ratepayer of
      doing so. It contrasted the case with another in which Union Gas Ltd. wished
      to sell cushion gas. In that case, the OEB considered ATCO and allocated
      100% of the gains to the utility, because the cushion gas was truly surplus, in
      that the utility was not going to replace it. 41
[109] In summary, the Board has the authority to allocate to ratepayers a portion of the
net gain on a sale where there is harm to ratepayers. The Board has found that there
will be harm to ratepayers from this transaction. However, Union’s proposal is for a
transfer price at net book value, and in Union’s view there is no net gain available for
allocation to ratepayers in any event.
[110] The Board believes that the clear rule in non-arm’s length transactions is that the
assets must be sold at fair market value. The question is “how is the fair value best
determined?” CME argues that it should be based on future revenues. Board staff
argues that the “net present value of revenues of the proposed Dawn Gateway Line
when apportioned to the St. Clair Line would be markedly higher than the proposed sale
price set at Net Book Value.” 42
[111] It is clear from recent experience and from the valuation prepared by Marcus &
Associates LLP Hoare•Dalton (“Valuation Report”) that the line is of limited value in its
current state, that is without the expansion portion and without the co-operation of
MichCon. The value of the line is in its ability to facilitate the overall project.

                                                                             Ontario Energy Board
                                               - 29 -
[112] The Valuation Report concludes that the St. Clair Line has a fair market value of
between $1.6 million and $2.0 million, which is lower than net book value. However, the
valuation is primarily driven by the assumption that revenues for the line will remain at
historical levels. No value is attributed related to future prospects. The Valuation
Report states:
      Potential opportunities for synergies, economies of scale or other benefits,
      which an acquisition may create for the Joint Venture, have been excluded
      from consideration on the basis that in a market with a single special interest
      purchaser the potential purchaser would not be willing to pay in excess of the
      intrinsic value indicated by the earning power of the existing operation. 43
[113] The Board does not accept the underlying assumption, namely that there would
only be a single special interest purchaser. The Board concludes that the St. Clair Line
might be attractive to other proponents of a cross-border transportation link between
Michigan storage and Dawn. In such circumstances, it is unlikely that Union would be
willing to sell to such a third party for net book value.
[114] The Valuation Report also contains the following:
      The price, which a potential purchaser might pay to acquire a business, is not
      only a function of the intrinsic value of the particular business to be acquired,
      but also the opportunities for synergies, economies of scale or other benefits,
      which the acquisition creates for the potential purchaser. The fair market
      value attributable to these additional benefits depends upon the unique
      circumstances of each specific special purchaser. The ultimate price for
      which a business might be sold may be higher or lower than its notional fair
      market value. 44 (emphasis added)
[115] The report therefore acknowledges that there is fair market value attributable to
these benefits, but concludes they are unique to each purchaser and for purposes of
this particular valuation, the fair market value of these benefits have been placed at
zero. The evidence shows that a value of zero is inappropriate.

[116] Board staff submitted: “A fair market assessment should reflect the prospective
transmission revenues of the proposed Dawn Gateway Line and should not be based
on the continued historical under performance of the St. Clair Line.” 45
[117] The ICF Report projects significant growth in demand for transportation services
between Michigan and Dawn over the period 2008 to 2018 and beyond. As Union
stated, “there is need for more transmission capacity from Michigan.” 46 There are now
Precedent Agreements with five shippers. They range from five to ten years for total
firm capacity of 295,459 GJ/d (or approximately 78% of initial capacity). These were
entered into after the Valuation Report was prepared. It is clear from these agreements
that once the full project is completed, the revenues will be substantially higher than
they are currently. The Board therefore concludes that the Valuation Report is deficient.
[118] CME argues that ratepayers are “entitled” to the increased utility asset utilization
benefits from the proposed transaction. The Board does not agree that ratepayers are
directly entitled to a share of future revenues from the pipeline. Ratepayers are entitled
to compensation for the harm imposed in the form of a suitable share of the proceeds of
the sale based on fair market value.
[119] CME’s approach is to determine value by estimating the net present value of the
future stream of net revenues. The Board agrees that this type of analysis is relevant to
determining the fair value of the asset being sold, but it presents significant difficulties.
[120] While there are precedents for calculating the transfer price on the basis of future
revenues, those cases were situations where the parties reached agreement 47 . The
determination of a fair share of future revenues is complex. It is subject to significant
judgment regarding the appropriate forecast of revenues and costs, the appropriate
division of risk between ratepayers and Dawn Gateway, and the appropriate allocation
to the St. Clair Line portion of the total pipeline.

47 In two recent arms-length transactions the Board approved a transfer price based on net book value
plus a share of future revenue. This was the case in the 2007 application by Hydro One Inc. to sell certain
assets to Burlington Hydro and the 2008 application by Hydro One Networks to sell certain assets to
Oakville Hydro. In both cases the transfer price was net book value plus a share of future revenue. See,

                                                                             Ontario Energy Board

[121] In the circumstances the Board agrees with the submissions of Board staff that
replacement value provides a more practical, objective and reasonable approach to
determining fair market value. However, this is not the replacement cost of the St. Clair
Line itself but rather the cost of the most economical alternative route. No purchaser
would be willing to pay more than this for the St. Clair Line, regardless of the future
earning potential of the total line, because this is the alternative that the purchaser has.
It might be argued that a purchaser would not be willing to pay as much as replacement
cost for a 20 year old pipeline, but on the other hand, a new line has more development
uncertainty attached to it as it has not yet been built. The Board estimates that the cost
of building an alternative line would be on the order of $13 million to $18 million. As a
result, the “net gain” is expected to be in the range of $8 million to $13 million.
[122] The Board further concludes that in order to mitigate the harm of the transaction,
ratepayers should be allocated an amount equivalent to the cumulative under-recovery
of the asset since 2003 from the proceeds of a sale based on fair market value as
determined by replacement cost. The Board estimates that the cumulative subsidy
since 2003 is approximately $5 million. Therefore, the “net gain” is clearly in excess of
the cumulative subsidy and the allocation to ratepayers will likely be in the range of
35%-65%.
[123] The Board will approve the transaction conditional on the ratepayers being
allocated a portion of the deemed net gain equivalent to the cumulative under-recovery
as of the date of the transaction. The Board directs Union to file the necessary
evidence to substantiate the cumulative under-recovery of the assets since 2003.
Given the Board expects the net gain, calculated as the difference between
replacement cost and net book value, will be well in excess of this cumulative under-
recovery, it will not be necessary for Union to file evidence on the replacement cost,
unless it chooses to do so. The Board will then fix the amount to be allocated to
ratepayers to compensate for the harm arising from the transaction. This amount will
only vary depending upon the timing of the actual transaction. The determination of the
relevant amount will be made as part of this proceeding so as to provide certainty to the
parties. A deferral account will be established to capture the amount of the allocation as
of the date of the transaction. Rates can be adjusted at a subsequent rates proceeding.
[124] In this proceeding the Board is also prepared to hear submissions regarding the
form of rate setting the Board should apply to the new proposed service. The new
service involves a limited number of sophisticated commercial customers who arguably
                                                                                   Ontario Energy Board
                                                   - 32 -
do not require the cost of service protection that the Board has traditionally provided to
end-use consumers. The Board is also always mindful of the need to introduce
efficiency to the rate setting process that will accommodate the needs of both the
customers and the utilities. The Board also recognizes the importance of this new
investment and its ability to increase the efficiency of the St. Clair Line and also
increase the liquidity of the Dawn Hub, an important objective the Board recognized in
the NGEIR decision. 48
Landowner Issues if there is Federal Jurisdiction
[125] The Board has found that the Dawn Gateway pipeline will remain under
provincial jurisdiction. However, the Board is of the view that it is necessary to address
the issue of impact on landowners if the Dawn Gateway pipeline is ultimately found to
be under federal jurisdiction. In that circumstance, the issue is whether landowners will
be worse off under NEB regulation than under their current arrangements.
[126] The discussion regarding impacts on landowners focused on three areas: land
use restrictions; abandonment; and recovery of regulatory costs. With respect to land
use, GAPLO/CAEPLA submitted:
      Land use restrictions imposed under the NEB Act and the associated Pipeline
      Crossing Regulations exceed any restrictions that result from Ontario
      legislation and regulations and will generate additional delay, risk and cost for
      landowners. 49
[127] There is also an additional 30 meter control zone beyond the easement, so not
only are the restrictions greater, it also affects a larger area of land and affects some
landowners along the St. Clair Line that do not currently have easement agreements
with Union.
[128] GAPLO/CAEPLA also expressed concern about the potential future
abandonment of the St. Clair Line and the progressive deterioration of the line if it is
abandoned in place. GAPLO/CAEPLA alleged there would be a regulatory vacuum
once the NEB allowed abandonment, and noted that while provincially abandonment is

                                           - 33 -
dealt with by the TSSA, these TSSA requirements would not apply to former NEB-
regulated pipelines. GAPLO/CAEPLA submitted that Union and DGPL should agree to
provide landowners with the option of removing the pipeline upon abandonment and
should remain liable regardless of any subsequent assignment.
[129] With respect to regulatory costs, GAPLO/CAEPLA noted that there is no cost
recovery for proceedings at the NEB, except for detailed routing proceedings.
[130] Union submitted that landowners have less risk of liability under federal
regulations than under provincial regulations. Union compared the provisions of the
TSSA Act and its regulations with the provisions of the National Energy Board Act.
Union did acknowledge that federal regulations can be more inconvenient for
landowners who are farmers. Union noted that the use of blanket crossing approvals,
which the NEB encourages, may mitigate this inconvenience by pre-approving certain
activities.
[131] DGPL reported that it has begun to negotiate a blanket approval. Union provided
a form of blanket approval with its Argument in Chief and indicated it would accept a
condition of approval that would require Dawn Gateway to offer a blanket approval in
substantially the same form as the one provided, subject to NEB orders. Board staff
supported this proposal.
[132] With respect to abandonment, Union submitted that landowners have greater
protection under federal regulation than under Ontario regulation: under federal
jurisdiction leave to abandon is required; under provincial jurisdiction it is not. Once the
pipeline is abandoned, the NEB has held that the abandoned pipeline comes under
provincial jurisdiction in any event.
[133] With respect to regulatory costs, Union acknowledged that the NEB offers limited
cost recovery but maintained that this would have limited impact on the St. Clair Line
landowners.
[134] GAPLO/CAEPLA submitted that Union’s application should be denied because it
has not assessed, quantified or valued the impacts on landowners:
      GAPLO/CAEPLA respectfully requests that the Board should nevertheless
      dismiss the application because of the complete absence in the evidentiary
                                                                          Ontario Energy Board
                                            - 34 -
      record of any effort by Union to identify, assess, mitigate or compensate for
      the impacts on landowner interests which will result from the proposed
      change in jurisdiction. 50
[135] GAPLO/CAEPLA argued that in the alternative, any approval should be subject
to GAPLO/CAEPLA’s proposed conditions, which it attached to its argument, and deal
with detailed matters of land use and include cost recovery for NEB proceedings in
accordance with the OEB’s tariff and practice direction. In the further alternative,
GAPLO/CAEPLA proposed that there should be a requirement for meaningful
discussions and a process for mediation and arbitration to resolve issues.
[136] DGPL disagreed with GAPLO/CAEPLA’s submissions and its proposed
remedies:
      The federal process is designed to mitigate all impacts upon landowners and
      to compensate for all damage caused in the construction, operation and
      abandonment of a pipeline. The existence of that process…provides the
      OEB with the comfort that any legitimate compensation related issues arising
      will be addressed in a fair and impartial manner. With respect, the OEB
      should refrain from conditioning its approval herein in such a way as to
      adjudicate issues said to arise under federal jurisdiction. 51
[137] Union maintained that the NEB’s restrictions are for safety purposes and further
argued that the project’s benefits associated with achieving the Board’s statutory
objectives should have precedence over landowner concerns.
[138] Union further argued that there was no reason to grant landowners new rights,
for example with respect to abandonment, or to prevent future assignment, as proposed
by GAPLO/CAEPLA. With respect to abandonment, Union maintained that there will be
no less protection under federal jurisdiction and that the TSSA will also apply to formerly
NEB-regulated line. Union further pointed out that the NEB required an abandonment
plan and that the issues can be dealt with in that process.

[139] With respect to GAPLO/CAEPLA’s proposed conditions, Union responded that
oversight of any blanket approval should be left to the NEB and that Union’s proposed
form of agreement better balances landowner and safety concerns. Union also noted
that cost compensation is being looked at as part of NEB’s Land Matters Consultation
Initiative.
Board Findings
[140] When determining whether there would be harm to landowners from the
transaction, the Board must first determine which landowners are the relevant ones.
GAPLO/CEAPLA argues that the Board should consider the landowners along the
expansion route as well as the landowners along the St. Clair Line. The Board does not
agree. The Board finds that it should consider the potential harm to landowners along
the St. Clair Line only.
[141] The St. Clair Line is currently in place and there are landowners who will be
facing a change in the form of regulation to which they will be subject if the NEB has
jurisdiction; this is not a change that could have been anticipated by those landowners
at the time of the line’s construction. The expansion line, on the other hand, has not yet
been built, and therefore those landowners are not facing a change in circumstances.
They will be in the same position as any other landowners over whose land a federally
regulated pipeline is proposed. They can take part in the NEB process in which there
will be a full assessment of the environmental impacts on the land and the appropriate
mitigation. Similarly, the easements and land use approvals will be developed with the
particular circumstances addressed.
[142] With respect to the landowners along the St. Clair Line, the Board concludes that
there would be some harm to landowners arising from the proposed transaction. This
harm relates to the greater restrictions placed on land use, the extended scope of land
affected, and the limited ability to recover regulatory costs.
[143] Union argues that the Board’s other objectives and the benefits of the project
overall are more important than the alleged harm to landowners. The Board finds that it
is not necessary to weigh landowner harm against the project’s benefits. What is
necessary is to mitigate the harm to landowners.
[144] GAPLO/CAEPLA argues that the application should be denied because Union
has not done a detailed analysis of the impacts. The Board does not agree. There is
                                                                          Ontario Energy Board
                                             - 36 -
substantial evidence on the record regarding the impacts on land use from the shift in
jurisdiction.
[145] With respect to land use, the Board is concerned to ensure that the landowners
along the St. Clair Line are in substantially the same position regardless of the change
in ownership. The Board finds that this can best be achieved if a blanket approval is
negotiated to the satisfaction of both sides. The Board notes DGPL’s commitment to
offer a blanket approval and Union’s proposed condition of approval related to this.
GAPLO/CAEPLA finds these commitments to be insufficient and instead proposes
detailed conditions relating to land use, cost recovery, and other matters.
[146] The Board concludes that it would be inappropriate to impose detailed land use
conditions on Union (and indirectly on Dawn Gateway). The NEB has a process to deal
with these issues and that process should be respected; as well, a negotiated solution
will undoubtedly be more enduring that one imposed by the Board. The Board will
adopt Union’s proposed condition that a blanket approval will be offered to landowners
(including those in the 30 m control zone) in a form substantially the same as that
provided in Union’s argument. The Board expects that further negotiation will be
required and will therefore also require that Union compensate landowners for their
reasonably incurred costs for negotiating a final blanket approval which is acceptable to
the parties and the NEB. The landowners will submit their cost claim to the OEB as part
of this proceeding.
[147] With respect to abandonment, the Board finds that there will be no material harm
as a result of the change in ownership. The NEB has a process through which
abandonment issues will be considered before leave to abandon will be granted, and
once abandoned, there will be provincial authority in place.
[148] With respect to regulatory costs, the primary impact for landowners along the St.
Clair Line is with respect to the current proceeding before the NEB. The Board finds
that the landowners’ concerns will be substantially addressed through a negotiated
blanket approval regarding land use, and the Board has already made provision for cost
recovery for that activity. The Board finds that no further condition regarding cost
recovery is warranted in the circumstances.
                                                                         Ontario Energy Board

THEREFORE THE BOARD ORDERS THAT:
  1. Union Gas Limited is hereby granted leave to sell the St. Clair Line to the Dawn
     Gateway Limited Partnership pursuant to section 43 of the Act on the following
     conditions:
         a) The sale price for ratemaking purposes shall be the fair market value
            which is defined as the replacement cost of the line.
         b) The ratepayers will receive a credit for ratemaking purposes equal to the
            amount of the cumulative under-recovery from 2003 until the time of the
            transaction which amount shall be placed in a deferral account for
            disposition in a rates proceeding.
         c) Union shall file with the Board, with a copy to all intervenors, its calculation
            of the cumulative under-recovery from 2003 to the current time and its
            estimate as of the closing date of the transaction. Union at its discretion
            may file its estimate of the replacement cost of the line.
  2. The Board’s leave to sell the St. Clair Line to the Dawn Gateway Limited
     Partnership shall expire on December 31, 2013. If the transaction has not been
     completed by that date, a new application for leave to sell will be required in
     order for the transaction to proceed.
  3. Union shall file the required information within 30 days of the date of this
     decision. Intervenors may make submissions regarding the accuracy of the
     estimate within 10 days of receiving the information from Union. Union will have
     an opportunity to reply to the submissions of the intervenors provided those
     submissions are made within 7 days of receipt of the intervenor’s submissions.
  4. Union at its discretion may file submissions regarding its view of the appropriate
     regulatory framework for the service proposed for the new line. Intervenors may
     respond by making submissions within 10 days of receiving Union’s submissions.
     Union will have an opportunity to reply to the submissions of the intervenors
     provided those submissions are made within 7 days of receiving the intervenor’s
     submissions. The Board may then issue a further Procedural Order, if
     necessary, with respect to filing of evidence or further submissions.

          Act (SARA) s Threatened However, as federal lands ro not present within the project
                                                                                                            area, the
          protection of this species lies within provincial jurisdiction. The Ministry of Natural Resources has
         jurisdiction over and responsibility for protecting herptile species at risk isted on Schedule I of SARA
         when fliey are off federal lands. bU understands that the proponent Is currently in discus

         the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources with respect to pwtecting this species. Based on the
         information we have received we are confident that MNR staff are deqtiately engaged and that the
         measures they recomnwrd win prevent sigr.ificant adverse enlronmerltaI effects cn Eastern
          Foxsnake. We therefore recommend that the proponent end NEB continue to consult relevant
         MNR staff for information n appropriate mitigation and monitoring requhernnIs that may be
         included In the CEAA Screening.
