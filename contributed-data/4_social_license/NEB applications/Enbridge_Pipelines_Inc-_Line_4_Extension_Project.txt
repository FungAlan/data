Scope. of the Environmental Assessment
Transport Canada (TC) Environmental Affairs -—- Prairie and Northern Region has reviewed the
Draft scape ofthc environmenta! assessment for the proposed Line 4 Extension Projecr‘ Our
comments pertain to TC’s anticipated involvement and responsibilities for the project.
TC involvement ,
TC notes that the pipeline route proposed by the prepomnt may be passing through, in, over or
under multiple watercourses that may require authorizatims pursuant to Section 5(1) of the
Navigable Water Protection Act (NWPA) and/or Section 108 of the NEE Act (Law List triggers).
As per the Department’s Federal Coordination Response letter of June 7, 2007, TC requires the
preponent to submit applications for approvals of water crossings to Transport Canada’s
Navigable Waters Promotien Program (NWPP) oﬂ’ice before it can determine which type of
NWPA approvals will be. required. far the project. At the present time, Transport Canada‘s
NWPP ofﬁce has not received any applications for this proj act. Until the proponent provides
these applications, TC is unable [0 fully identify our involvement 'in the environmental
assessment process. Based on the information provided by the proponent in the Preliminary
Infomation Package, TC~anironmental Affairs is operating under the assumption that our
ciepanment wiii have a CEAA trigger and is participating in the environmental process as per the
“in until out policy“. Accordingly, TC is pleased to comment on the draft scope.
TC responsibilities
* When NWP applications are received and TC confirms that it is a Responsible Authority (RA)
for the pmj eat, the Department will limit it"s involvement in the project to it’s triggered

 Dear Ms. Dutil-Berry
 RE: LINE 4 EXTENSION - LETTER OF COMMENT
 Environment Canada (EC) has completed its review of the application and survey information for
 the above noted project. The scope of specialist or expert information or knowledge provided by
 EC at this time, to the Responsible Authorities (RA) is within the Department’s mandate as
 defined through specific statutes and regulations assigned to the Minister of the Environment and
 through our Federal Authority (FA) role and responsibilities under the Canadian Environmental
 Assessment Act.
EC is providing this letter of comment with respect to the effectiveness to mitigate the adverse
environmental effects of the Project on wetlands and how proposed mitigation measures,
including compensation, would be expected to meet the objectives of the Federal Policy on
Wetland Conservation. In addition, EC is providing comment on species at risk observations.
EC appreciates the opportunity to provide feedback and recommendations on this matter.
 Federal Policy on Wetland Conservation
 The objective of the Federal Government with respect to wetland conservation is to “promote the
 conservation of Canada's wetlands to sustain their ecological and socioeconomic functions, now
 and in the future”.1 In support of the above objective, the Federal Government, in cooperation
 with the provinces and territories and the Canadian public, will strive to achieve the following
 goals:
      • maintenance of the functions and values derived from wetlands throughout Canada,
      • no net loss of wetland functions on all federal lands and waters,
      • enhancement and rehabilitation of wetlands in areas where the continuing loss or
           degradation of wetlands or their functions have reached critical levels, and
      • recognition of wetland functions in resource planning, management and economic
           decision-making with regard to all federal programs, policies and activities
 Wetland Mitigation Measures
 To achieve no net loss of wetlands, the federal government adopted the wetland mitigation
 framework established by the North American Wetlands Conservation Council (1998 and
 2000).2,3
 1
   The Federal Policy on Wetland Conservation. 1991. By the Government of Canada. Environment Canada.
 2
   North American Wetlands Conservation Council (Canada). 1998. Wetland Mitigation and Compensation, Proceedings of
 a National Workshop. Compiled by Kenneth W. Cox and Allison Grose. Report No. 98-1. Environment Canada and
 Canadian Wildlife Service, Ottawa, Ontario.
 Proponents of projects on lands supporting wetlands are expected to implement a hierarchical
progression of mitigation alternatives, as follows:
     1. avoid damage or destruction of wetlands,
     2. minimize the unavoidable impacts, and
     3. compensate for residual impacts that cannot be minimized.
Compensation has been defined as action taken at another location to offset the negative impacts
of an undertaking on the functions and/or area of a particular wetland.2 Compensation efforts, in
turn, should implement the following hierarchical progression:
     1. restoration of degraded wetlands (i.e., return of a totally or highly-altered natural wetland
          to its previous function),
     2. enhancement of existing wetlands (i.e., the increase of one or more values of all or a
          portion of an existing wetland, through human actions), and
     3. creation of a wetland (i.e., conversion of a non-wetland area into a wetland through
          human action).
Compensation ratios (wetland restored/created to wetland lost) are typically set on a case specific
basis, however, the guidelines suggest that the ratios may be higher than the baseline 1:1 in
recognition of: society’s inability to create fully functioning wetlands, with certainty, owing to the
inherent risk in wetland creation and restoration and current deficiencies in the supporting
wetland science.3
During the review of this application, EC acknowledges that 21 wetlands or wetland complexes
were identified along or proximal to the Edmonton Loop, while 27 were identified along the
Kingman Loop and 40 along the Strome Loop. The proponent states that impacts to wetland
function are reversible in the short to medium term and of low magnitude (Application page 6-70)
and anticipates vegetation to be generally well-established within one to three years (Application
page 6-12). EC notes that there will be a loss of wetland function for several years until the
habitat recovers and in several instances the habitat will be permanently modified. Recoveries of
wetland habitats are also dependent on environmental conditions, and during extreme wet or dry
conditions, recovery may become protracted.
EC recommends that Enbridge Pipeline Inc.:
     1. provide detailed wetland compensation measures including restoration of existing
          degraded wetlands, enhancement of existing wetlands, and creation of
          replacement wetlands,
     2. apply a wetland compensation ratio of 3:1,
     3. discuss how the proposed measures would be expected to meet the Federal Policy
          on Wetland Conservation, and
     4. provide a monitoring program to monitor the success of the wetland compensation
          to ensure wetland function can be restored and that the no net loss of wetland
          function can be achieved.
Wildlife and Wetland Surveys
Environment Canada acknowledges that updated 2007 wildlife and wetland surveys were
provided under separate cover by TERA Environmental.
EC recommends that observations of rare plants and animals be forwarded to the
provincial Fisheries and Wildlife Management Information System (FWMIS) to augment the

EC looks forward to continued dialogue and co-operation with Enbridge Pipeline Inc. and TERA
Environmental and the RA with respect to the Line 4 Extension. If you have any questions,
