 3.     The potential commercial impacts of the Project.
6.     Potential impact on the bulk power system, including neighbouring jurisdictions.
The Industrial Power Users of Niagara represents a group of large industrial power users based in the
Regional Municipality in Niagara. IPUN advocates for hydro rate incentives for larger industrial power users
through the proposed Beck Economic Cluster Pilot, a proposed rate incentive program for industrial users
based within 50 kilometres of the Niagara-New York intertie.
IPUN's interest is in filing comment pertinent to the impact of the ITC Lake Erie Connector project on hydro
rates for Ontario consumers, particularly in terms of Global Adjustment impacts for industrial power users.
The transmission of electricity from Ontario to the United States may have negative ramifications for hydro
ratepayers in Ontario. Industry is among the largest ratepayer groups and users of electricity in Ontario, and
any impacts on hydro rates and the Global Adjustment from the ITC Lake Erie Connector project would have a
direct commercial impact on the finances of members of IPUN.

 7.     The potential environmental and socio-economic effects of the Project, including any cumulative effects
       that are likely to result from the Project, including those required to be considered by the NEB’s
       Electricity Filing Manual.
9.     Potential impacts of the Project on Aboriginal interests.
11. The terms and conditions to be included in any recommendation, or approval, the Board may issue.
Environment and Climate Change Canada’s (ECCC) mandate is to protect the quality of Canada’s natural
environment. ECCC has a regulatory interest and expertise in migratory birds, species at risk and water
quality as administrators of: the Migratory Birds Convention Act (1994), the Species At Risk Act (SARA),
Canadian Environmental Protection Act (1999) and subsection 36(3) of the Fisheries Act, respectively. ECCC
also supports Canada’s commitments to restore and protect the ecosystem health and water quality of Lake
Erie, in accordance with the Canada-Ontario-Agreement-respecting-the-Great-Lakes-Basin-Ecosystem and the
Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement.
With respect to Issue 7, ECCC will provide advice on potential environmental effects of the project on
migratory birds, in particular, staging waterfowl at the Long Point National Wildlife Area, on terrestrial
species at risk, and on water quality. ECCC will also provide advice on relevant mitigation measures. ECCC’ s
comments would focus on potential environmental effects of the cable installation and project operation on
the water quality of Lake Erie and on migratory birds. The proposed cable route is proximal to the Long Point
National Wildlife Area, a major staging area for migrating waterfowl; thus, it is essential that route selection,
project construction and operation do not negatively affect migrating waterfowl and their habitat. ECCC’s
comments may also contain information concerning potential cumulative effects on water quality due to
existing sediment contamination in Lake Erie in conjunction with proposed pre-construction and construction
activities.
With respect to Issue 9, ECCC may provide advice and information within its mandate on issues that are
raised by Aboriginal communities in relation to the project.
With respect to Issue 11, ECCC may provide advice on terms and conditions related to ECCC’s mandates for
migratory birds, species at risk, and water quality.

 4.     The suitability of the design, construction and operation of the Project.
5.     Safety and security during construction and operation of the Project, including emergency response
       planning and third-party damage prevention.
7.     The potential environmental and socio-economic effects of the Project, including any cumulative effects
       that are likely to result from the Project, including those required to be considered by the NEB’s
       Electricity Filing Manual.
8.     The appropriateness of the general route and land requirements for the Project.
10. Potential impacts of the Project on landowners and the use of lands and waters.
Key items identified during an earlier meeting between staff and proponents. 1. Official Plan Policy - subject
lands for Converter Station are designated Agriculture. Official Plan permits the location of power lines and
related substations in all land use designations. 2. Zoning - Identified lands are zoned Agriculture and bylaw
permits power lines and the related substations 3. Site Plan control - Construction of Converter Station will
be subject to site plan control. Site plan application would be required to address issues such as entrance,
drainage, storm-water management, parking, fire-safety, waste-disposal, landscaping, environmental and
archaeological assessment, and conformity with surrounding land uses. Appropriate securities will be
obtained and a site plan agreement will be signed and registered on title to make sure that the proposed
development proceeds as per approved site plan. 4. Minor Variance Application - A minor variance
application will be required to seek relief of the related provisions of the Agricultural Zone of the City of
Nanticoke Zoning By-law for the height of the Converter Station Building, and possibly the deficient setback
from the western property line. 5. Severance/Leasing - No severance application will be required as
(according to the proponent) the whole property containing 39 acres has been purchased for the project.
While roughly 6 acres will be utilized for the Converter Station, the rest will be leased out for farming. 6.
Servicing Capacity Allocation - it is yet indeterminate if servicing will be required for the proposed Converter
Station. In case servicing is required here, only municipal water may be available in the area. For the sanitary
needs, private septic system will need to be installed. 7. The road use matters will require the execution of a
land use agreement with County for which the Council's approval (for use over 25 years) will be required. The
agreement will need to be customized by the proponents lawyer and Haldimand County's lawyer. 8. A Traffic
Control plan will be required during construction 9. Road Entrance and Road Excavation permits are
required for all work within the road right of way. 10. Preference would be siting cable wholly within
Haldimand Road 55 road allowance. This would be simplest solution as no easement would be required to be
registered on title. It may be supported if easement would extend beyond road allowance onto easterly
boundary of all lands owned by Haldimand County. 11. Haldimand County Forestry Conservation issues
include a. running lines or substations through woodlands should be avoided b. vegetation management
plan for how the trees are retainable but close to construction are to be protected. c. process for
exemptions to the by-law for woodland destruction if the line must go through a woodland and the
compensation rates (monetary or reforestation program) for loss of woodland. d. Process for removal of
trees along County road allowances and compensation rates (monetary or part of a planting program) for
trees e. Communication plan from contractor for informing public informed of tree removals or replanting.

 6.     Potential impact on the bulk power system, including neighbouring jurisdictions.
Manitoba Hydro is a provincial Crown Corporation established pursuant to The Manitoba Hydro Act.
Manitoba Hydro engages in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity to customers in the
Province of Manitoba, as well as to other Canadian provinces and wholesale customers in the United States.
Manitoba Hydro’s transmission system is directly connected with the transmission systems of several extra-
provincial utilities and transmission companies, including Hydro One in Ontario.
The proposed international power line will also be connected (at the Canadian side) to the Hydro One
transmission system. Given that Manitoba Hydro is situated in a neighboring jurisdiction, and is directly
connected to the same transmission system, Manitoba Hydro is potentially impacted by the Project and as
such, has a valid and significant interest in the application, the evidence, the hearing and the Board’s
decision.

The Nanticoke WTP has two Type A (Great Lakes) intakes located approximately 465 m apart
in Lake Erie and one Type D intake located at the Industrial Pumping Station (IPS). The west
and east in-lake intake cribs for the Nanticoke WTP are located approximately 500 and 520 m
offshore, respectively. The depth of both in-lake intakes is approximately 6.3m.
The Great Lakes intakes are shared with a power generation facility. Water flows via gravity
from Lake Erie to the power generation facility forebay. A channel located in the west bank of
the forebay connects to the industrial pumping stations (IPS) wet well. The IPS has its own
forebay structure with sluice gates separating the forebay wet well and the submersible low lift
pumps. This system acts as the control point for the Nanticoke WTP and was considered as a
Type D intake control structure for the purposes of source protection planning.
The Nanticoke WTP is a conventional treatment plant (package plant) that receives raw water
from Lake Erie via the industrial forebay of the power generation facility. The treatment process
consists of pre-screening and chlorination, coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration,
and disinfection. Powder activated carbon is added for taste and odour control when necessary.

       Stantec. 2011 Revision to Delineation and Vulnerability Scoring of the East and West
        Intake for the Nanticoke WTP
7.1.1   Intake Protection Zone - 1
Intake protection zones (IPZ) 1 and 2 were delineated for the in-lake intakes using Part VI of the
Technical Rules set by the Ministry of the Environment (November 2008). The in-lake intakes
were each given a circular IPZ-1 with a radius of 1 km centred on the crib of each intake (Map
7-2 and Map 7-3). Although the IPZ-1’s delineated for the two in-lake intakes for the Nanticoke
WTP overlap, they were not merged into a combined delineation, and were assessed as
independent zones. A 120 m setback was included where the IPZ-1 intersected with land. See
Map 7-2 and Map 7-3 for the IPZ-1 for the east and west in-lake intakes.
Given that the industrial pumping station (IPS) sits 150m inland from Lake Erie with an open
forebay where water flows via gravity from the power generating facility forebay through an
intake supply tunnel, an IPZ-1 was delineated around the wet-well and forebay structure based
on professional engineering judgment, in accordance with the Technical Rules and
acknowledgement of local drainage characteristics. Therefore, the IPZ-1 for the industrial
pumping station (IPS) consisted of the IPS forebay with a 120 m setback with adjustments
made to address localized drainage characteristics (Map 7-4).
7.1.2   Intake Protection Zone - 2
An IPZ-2 was delineated for the Nanticoke WTP intakes using a time of travel of 2 hours. The 2
hour time of travel was deemed appropriate by County staff for sufficient operator response.
Operators stated in interviews that the intake could be shut down within 2 hours without
negative impact to ongoing plant operations upon notification or awareness of an imminent
threat that could impair the quality of water supply at the intake or negatively affect the water
treatment plant’s ability to produce safe water.
An IPZ-2 is defined as an area surrounding the intake that takes into account characteristics of
the local area including local water currents, shoreline features and local tributaries. An IPZ-2
accommodates the following:
       The area within each surface water body that may contribute water to the intake where
        the time of travel to the intake is sufficient for operator response to an adverse condition;
       A 2 hour time of travel response time;
       Areas within storm sewer sheds and other drainages that drain toward the intake; and
       A setback of not more than 120 m inland or the Conservation Authority regulated area,
        whichever is greater if the area abuts land.

The in-water modeling for the Nanticoke west and east intakes was undertaken as a cluster
using the 3-D MIKE3 model to simulate the hydrodynamic conditions of the Lake Erie shoreline
area. Developed by the Danish Hydraulic Institute, MIKE3 can simulate un-steady 3D flows in
lakes, rivers and oceans taking into consideration density variations, bathymetry and external
forcing functions including meteorology, tides, current velocity and surface elevation. The model
has the ability to define several levels of nesting to provide the resolution necessary at specific
locations within the computational domain. The model was run to simulate a 10-year wind
condition from eight compass point directions, and a 2-year flow in gauged tributaries.
The in-water hydrodynamic modeling for the Nanticoke West and East intakes was undertaken
as a cluster. A single in-water IPZ-2 was delineated to represent both of the Type A intakes
given the close proximity of the two intakes relative to hydrodynamic variability in a large Great
Lake. The IPZ-2 extended approximately 3,355m east of the east intake, 4,673 m west of the
west intake and 2,600 m offshore, at its furthest extent.
The upland IPZ-2s for the west and east intakes were not initially merged. However, the upland
extents of the IPZ-2 for both in-lake intakes differ only slightly, therefore one IPZ-2 for both in-
lake intakes was created. The IPZ-2 was extended up-tributary along Nanticoke Creek, Hickory
Creek and an unnamed watercourse to the extent of a 2 hour travel time. Within the 120 m
setback of the unnamed watercourse is an engineered wetland that is hydraulically connected to
the watercourse during high water events, so it was also included as part of the IPZ-2. Part of
the IPZ-2 consists of a forebay and condenser cooling water channel that are part of a power
generation facility and that are within a 2 hour travel time of the lake intakes during specific
operating conditions. Therefore all discharges within a 2 hour travel time to the forebay and
condenser cooling water channel were included in the IPZ-2. These included the local storm
sewer network and an ash setting lagoon that is connected via a pipe to the condenser cooling
water channel.
The Great Lakes intakes are shared with a power generation facility. Water flows via gravity
from Lake Erie to the power generation facility forebay. A channel located in the west bank of
the forebay connects to the industrial pump station (IPS) where water is withdrawn for municipal
supply. Given this connection to Lake Erie, the IPS intake was classified as a Type D intake.
The IPZ-2 for the IPS includes the power generation facility forebay and the storm sewer
network that drains to it. The hydraulic retention time of the forebay was determined to be less
than 2 hours therefore the entire forebay was included. In the absence of knowledge of water
flow velocities through the storm sewer network to the forebay it was assumed that the entire
storm sewer network, including the drainage network for the power generation facility and an
adjoining switchyard, would contribute to a 2 hour travel time. All pathways contributing water to
the forebay were included in the IPZ-2.
7.1.3   Intake Protection Zone - 3
At this stage, it was determined that an IPZ-3 is not needed for the Type A intakes (East and
West).
The delineation extent of an IPZ-3 for a Type D intake is the total water contributing areas.
Through an analysis of available information relating to storm sewer networks, water courses
and drainage, it was determined that all pathways contributing water to the forebay (IPS intake)
are included in their entirety in IPZ-2.

 Long Point Region SPA                                           Approved Assessment Report
7.1.4   Vulnerability Assessment
Vulnerability analysis of the IPZ-1 and IPZ-2 includes consideration for both the area and the
source as described in the Technical Rules. The area vulnerability factor for an IPZ-1 is
prescribed to be 10 while the area vulnerability factor for an IPZ-2 can range from 7 to 9. The
area vulnerability for an IPZ 2 takes into account the percentage of the IPZ-2 area that is land,
land cover, soil type, soil permeability and transport pathways.
The in-lake IPZ-2 zones have a low percentage of land (e.g. approximately 14%), most of which
is forested, green space or agricultural. The soil type is predominantly clay and the slope is
between 2 to 5%, which indicates a high potential for runoff generation and movement of
contaminants to the lake. In addition, there were some transport pathways identified that could
convey contaminants to the intake protection zone. The overall assessment was that the in-lake
IPZ-2 zones were moderately vulnerable, therefore, the area vulnerability factor for the IPZ-2 for
both of the in-lake intakes was scored as a 8.0.
IPZ-2 for the intake at the Industrial Pump Station was given the highest score possible, 9.0,
based on the fact that 94% of the IPZ is land that is largely developed and has high potential for
runoff generation based on soil type and slope, and that the land area is drained with storm
sewers with outfalls within the IPZ-2 that can act as transport pathways.
The source vulnerability factor for a Great Lake Type A intake can range from 0.5 to 0.7. Source
vulnerability scoring takes into account the intake characteristics, such as the depth of the
intake, the distance the intake is offshore and whether there have been any identified water
quality concerns at the intake. The source vulnerability for the in-lake intakes was determined to
be 0.5 considering that the intakes in the lake are quite deep (6.3 m); extends 500m+ from
shore; and there have been few water quality concerns identified at the intake. The source
vulnerability factor for the Industrial Pump Station however, was scored a 1.0 considering that it
is located entirely inland and consists of an open forebay with the intake in a shallow wet well.
The vulnerability scores for the Nanticoke east, west and IPS IPZ-1 and -2 are summarized in
Table 7-3.

7.1.6   Percent Impervious Surfaces within Intake Protection Zones
To calculate the percent impervious surface, information on land cover classification from the
Southern Ontario Land Resource Information system (SOLRIS) was used. This provided land
use information, including road and highway transportation routes, as continuous 15x15 metre
October 30, 2015                                                                                 7-4
 Long Point Region SPA                                             Approved Assessment Report
grid cells across the entire Source Protection Area. All the cells that represent highways and
other impervious surfaces used for vehicular traffic were re-coded with a cell value of 1 and all
other land cover classifications were given a value of 0, to identify impervious surface areas.
Then, a focal sum moving window average was applied using the Spatial Analyst module of the
ArcGIS software. For each 15x15 metre cell, the total number of neighbouring grid cells coded
as impervious, within a 1x1 kilometre search area, was calculated. This total was then
converted into the percentage of impervious surface by land area, using the area of each cell
(225 sq. m) and the area of the moving window (1 sq. km). This provides a 1x1 kilometre
moving window calculation of percent impervious surface, represented in 15x15 metre spatial
increments. This dataset was calculated for the entire Source Protection Area, but was clipped
to show those results only in the Wellhead Protection Areas and Intake Protection Zones. The
analysis is more representative of road density and is better than the method described in the
Technical Rules. As per Technical Rule 15.1, the Director has confirmed their agreement with
the departure. The Director‘s letter of confirmation can be found in Appendix B.
The percent impervious surface for all Nanticoke Intake Protection Zones ranges from 0% -
<8%, except for the IPS IPZ-1 which ranges from 1 to <8%. (Map 7-8, Map 7-9)

7.1.8    Uncertainty
Uncertainty was assessed by the Consultant for the delineation of the IPZs and the vulnerability
scoring for the Nanticoke WTP intakes. Uncertainty was considered for the (1) data that was
used in the analysis; (2) modeling; (3) quality assurance and quality control; (4) calibration and
validation; and (5) accuracy of the vulnerability factors.
There was a high level of confidence in the datasets used to delineate the in-lake IPZ-1s;
however, the IPZ-1 around the Industrial Pump Station required professional engineering
judgment with guidance from the Technical Rules. Regardless, a low level of uncertainty was
assigned to the IPZ-1’s and no limitations were identified.
Hydrodynamic modeling was used for the delineation of the in-lake IPZ-2 and the following
limitations were noted:
        The numerical model did not account for wave-induced currents, which are more
         important in shallow water and may impact the IPZ-2;
        Hydrodynamic modeling provided a general understanding of currents and the resultant
         in-water IPZ-2 for a range of conditions, however it did not provide a detailed analysis of
         the physical processes at the site such as upwelling or the dispersion of contaminant
         plumes through natural diffusion transport processes as a result of density currents;

       A 10-year return period wind speed was used in the matrix runs. The model was run at a
        constant wind speed until the model reached steady state. This is not realistic as this
        constant wind speed would not be sustained in reality, so it is not possible to associate a
        return period duration with the event;
       Only gauged tributaries were defined in the model; and
       A conservative approach was taken in the reverse particle tracking. Particles were
        released at the surface where currents are stronger. Particles were also released near
        the lakebed for comparison; however the particles released at the surface were used to
        delineate the IPZ 2s.
Although large, in-lake hydrodymanic modelling is inherently uncertain, the study team felt that
the IPZ-2 delineation was sufficient for the purposes of source protection planning and an
overall uncertainty for IPZ-2’s for the in-lake intakes was considered low.
A high level of uncertainty was given to the delineation of the IPZ-2 for the IPS given the lack of
information and data for this area. Cross section data for the forebay was estimated by aerial
photography leading to high uncertainty in the volume of the forebay and therefore the hydraulic
retention time. Storm sewer networks outfalling to the forebay were available, but water
velocities in those networks were not and assumptions were made as to the extent those
networks contributed to the IPZ-2.
Sufficient data and information was gathered to assign a low level of uncertainty for the
vulnerability score for IPZ-1s and for the IPZ-2 for the East and West intakes. Vulnerability
scoring for IPZ-2 for the IPS was determined by the Consultant to have high uncertainty based
on the limited number of sources of data used in determining the vulnerability score.

7.1.9    Threats Assessment
The Ontario Clean Water Act, 2006 defines a Drinking Water Threat as “an activity or condition
that adversely affects or has the potential to adversely affect the quality or quantity of any water
that is or may be used as a source of drinking water, and includes an activity or condition that is
prescribed by the regulation as a drinking water threat.”
The Technical Rules (MOE, 2009a) list five ways in which to identify a drinking water threat:
       a)    Through an activity prescribed by the Act as a Prescribed Drinking Water Threat;
       b)    Through an activity identified by the Source Water Protection Committee as an
             activity that may be a threat and (in the opinion of the Director) a hazard
             assessment confirms that the activity is a threat;
       c)    Through a condition that has resulted from past activities that could affect the quality
             of drinking water;
       d)    Through an activity associated with a drinking water issue; and
       e)    Through an activity identified through the events based approach (this approach has
             not been used in this Assessment Report).
Threats can fall into one of the following four categories:
        Chemical threats can include toxic metals, pesticides, fertilizers, petroleum products and
        industrial solvents;
        Pathogenic threats are microorganisms that could cause illness; and
        Dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) are chemicals which are denser than water
        and do not dissolve in water, such as chlorinated solvents.
        Through a condition that has resulted from past activities that could affect the quality of
        drinking water.
Significant threats to the Nanticoke water supply were assessed through the development of a
desktop land use inventory.

Threat assessment was completed based on the vulnerability attributed to the intake protection
zones. According to the Ministry of the Environment’s Table of Drinking Water Threats, a
vulnerability score of 5 for the in-lake IPZ-1s and 4.0 for the IPZ-2s means that there are no
significant threats for these vulnerable areas. However, given that the Industrial Pump Station
vulnerability score was a 10 and 9 for the IPZ-1 and IPZ-2, respectively; significant threats were
identified for this intake. A list of all significant threat types is shown in Table 7-7.

      Drinking Water Threat category.
 Note: Certain types of activities on residential properties that are incidental in nature and that are significant drinking water
 threats are not enumerated. These threats include the application of commercial fertilizer on residential properties, the storage of
 organic solvents (dense non-aqueous phase liquids) on residential properties, and the storage of fuel (e.g., heating fuel tanks) on
 residential properties in natural gas serviced areas.
 Note: Storm sewer piping is not considered to be part of a storm water management facilty.
Discussion of Significant Threats
The significant threats identified for the Industrial Pump Station IPZ-1 and IPZ-2 occur on two
properties. In the IPS IPZ-1, it was assumed that liquid fuel is handled and stored on the
property in quantities that exceed 2,500L to ensure the operation of a back up generator. In the
IPZ-2, the land use activity that was identified as a possible significant threat was the potential
operation of a system that discharges to surface water and has as its primary function the
collection, transmission or treatment of industrial sewage. It was assumed that the facility is
required to report to the National Pollution Release Inventory (NPRI) on its discharges to
surface water. Further on-site investigation is required to confirm or refute these significant
threats.
Information Sources for Threat Assessment
The following data and information sources were queried to identify significant threats for the
Nanticoke WTP:
         Canadian Water and Wastewater Association Directory of contaminants;
         Federal Contaminated Sites Inventory;
         North American Industry Classification System (NAICS);
         National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI);

Limitations, Data Gaps, and Uncertainty in the Threats Assessment
In general, the available data were of sufficient quality and quantity to complete an initial threats
assessment and issue identification. However, soil quality data were not available for the study
area and is considered a data gap.
Raw water quality data were provided for the years of 1990-2008 which was sufficient for a
general characterization of the raw water; however, more frequent and consistent sampling is
required to complete a statistical analysis with associated confidence.
The following details additional data gaps identified through this assessment:
        Storm and sanitary sewersheds for the industrial park;
        Chemical associated with industrial outfalls located within the IPZ-1 and IPZ-2; and
        Some raw water quality parameters from Schedule 2 and 3 in the ODWS
7.1.10 Conditions Evaluation
Information from two reports was used to evaluate conditions in the study area: soil and
sediment data/information in an Environment Canada report on sediment quality in tributaries
draining to Lake Erie (Dove et al. 2002); and a report completed by Stantec (2010b) that
summarized sediment quality data collected by Riggs Engineering for the purposes of
characterizing sediments in the study area.
Although elevated levels of arsenic, nickel and silver were found in the sediment of local
tributaries (Dove et al. 2002) within the IPZ-2s of the in-lake intakes, and the levels exceeded
the sediment standards described in Table 1 of the Soil, Ground Water and Sediment
Standards, these threats are not considered significant due to the low vulnerability scores for
these vulnerability areas. The vulnerability score of the Nanticoke WTP west and east intakes’
IPZ-2 produces a calculated risk score below the threshold established in the Technical Rules,
which means that the conditions present within the IPZ-2 vulnerable area of the west and east
intake do not pose a threat. However, contaminated sediment in the IPZ-1 for the Industrial
Pump Station highlighted elevated sediment concentrations of chromium (total), copper, nickel
and zinc, which exceeded the sediment standards described in Table 1 of the Soil, Ground
Water and Sediment Standards. The hazard score for contaminated sediment in the Industrial
Pump Station IPZ-1 is 10 per Technical Rule 139(2), as the sediment is present on the same
property as the intake.
The resulting risk score for contaminated sediment in the Industrial Pump Station forebay, as
determined based on the Industrial Pump Station IPZ-1 vulnerability score (10) and hazard
score (10) is 100. Therefore, these conditions are considered a significant drinking water threat
under the Technical Rules. Map 7-11 illustrates the location of the contaminated sediment
which characterizes a condition within the IPS IPZ-1.

7.1.11 Preliminary Issues Identification and Parameters of Concern
The analysis to determine water quality Issues for the Nanticoke WTP consisted of comparing
available raw water sampling data to established Issues benchmarks. Three preliminary Issues
were identified for the Nanticoke WTP vulnerable areas:
    -    temperature
    -    hardness
    -    organic nitrogen
The three identified preliminary Issues are parameters listed in Table 4 of the Technical support
Document for Ontario Drinking Water Standards and Objectives (MOE 2006) and are therefore
aesthetic objectives and operational guidelines. Aesthetic objectives are set to guard against the
impairment of odour, taste and colour in finished water. Operational guidelines are set to ensure
water treatment operations are effective and efficient for treated and distributed water. The three
identified preliminary Issues are not directly related to human health considerations and the
preliminary Issues of hardness and temperature have been attributed to naturally occurring
processes and characteristics. Therefore, these parameters are not considered drinking water
Issues.
The identification of potential contributors for the preliminary issue of organic nitrogen requires
additional investigation before it can be decided to identify it as an issue under Technical Rule
114 as it may not be solely contributed to by naturally occurring processes. Additional raw water
monitoring is recommended to characterize organic nitrogen levels in the raw water and confirm
or refute it as an issue. Given that organic nitrogen may be contributed by the prescribed
drinking water threat – the establishment, operation or maintenance of a system that collects,
stores, transmits, treats or disposes of sewage, further investigation is required to ascertain
information to confirm or refute the linkage between this land use activity and the preliminary
issue of elevated organic nitrogen.

Attn: Project Review Committee
National Energy Board
Dear Review Committee:
           Re: lTC Lake Erie Connector International Power Line Project
Please accept the following information as Haldimand County's submission as an
approved Commenter for the lTC Lake Erie Connector Project to the National
Energy Board.
1.     Official Plan Policy
       In the Haldimand County Official Plan, the subject lands intended for the
       Converter Station are designated Agriculture. The Haldimand County
       Official Plan policy permits the location of power lines and related
       substations in all land use designations. Therefore, the proposal conforms
       to the Official Plan policy.
2.     Zoning
       All three lots in the subject lands are zoned 'Agricultural (A) Zone. The
       zoning by-law permits power lines and the related substations in all zones.
3.     Site Plan Control
       Being a development of industrial nature, the construction of the Converter
       Station will be subject to site plan control. A site plan application would be
       required to address issues such as entrance, drainage, stormwater
       management, parking, fire-safety, waste-disposal, landscaping,
       environmental and archaeological assessment, and conformity with
       surrounding land uses. Appropriate securities will be obtained and a site
       plan agreement will be signed and registered on title to make sure that the
       proposed development proceeds as per approved site plan.
4.     Minor Variance Application
       A minor variance application will be required to seek relief of the related
       provisions of the 'Agricultural (A)' Zone of the City of Nanticoke Zoning By-
       law for the height of the Converter Station building and terminal station,
       and possibly the deficient setback from the western property line.
5.     Detailed Effects Assessment

                        Phone: (905) 318-5932 · Fax: (905) 772-3542
                                 www.HaldimandCounty.on.ca
     Haldimand County Planning Staff have also reviewed the Detailed Effects
    Assessment with focus on land use compatibility matters are as follows:
    o Acoustic environment (noise): conclusions of the assessment note
         that sound levels for the operation will be well below MOECC and
         Health Canada limits (i.e. for sensitive off site receptors- residential).
         There will be some impacts during construction but within acceptable
         limits and only temporary.
    o    Air quality (odour, dust, exhaust): impacts during operation of the
         facility will be close to nil (and well below any MOECC thresholds).
         There will be some dust impacts during construction but again within
         acceptable limits and only for a temporary period of time.
    o    Traffic: there will be impacts during construction but it will be staged
         and for only a limited period of time. During operation, there impacts
         will be essentially nil with only 1 to 2 employees.
6.  Archaeology
    Assessment is underway and a Stage 3 is planned for select areas. This
    fundamental heritage interest is thus being addressed.
7.  Severance/Leasing
    No severance application will be required as (according to the proponent)
    the whole property containing 39 acres has been purchased for the
    project. While roughly 6 acres will be utilized for the Convertor Station, the
    rest will be leased out for farming.
B.  Servicing capacity allocation
    It is yet indeterminate if servicing will be required for the proposed
    Converter Station. In case servicing is required here, only municipal water
    may be available in the area. For the sanitary needs, private septic system
    will need to be installed.
9.  Land Use Agreement
    The road use matters will require the execution of a land use agreement
    with County for which the Council's approval (for use over 25 years) will
    be required. The agreement will need to be customized by the proponent's
    lawyer and Haldimand County's lawyer.
10. Traffic Impact Study
    While a Traffic Impact Study will not be required, a Traffic Control Plan,
    will be required during construction which the proponent is to prepare in
    consultation with Haldimand County Public Works, Engineering Services
    and Development and Design Division.
11. Road Entrance Permits
    Road Entrance Permits are required for any entrances. Road Excavation
    Permit will be required for all work within the road right of way. A traffic
    control plan is required for review for the construction process and to
    ensure all lines are locatable and road crossings are identified in drawings
    and onsite.
12. Cable Placement
       The preference would be siting the cable wholly within the Haldimand
      Road # 55 road allowance. This would be the simplest solution as no
      easement would be required to be registered on title. It may also be
      supported if the easement would extend beyond the road allowance on to
      the easterly boundary of the lands owned by Haldimand County.
13.   Forestry Conservation
      The following items were raised by Norfolk County's Community Services
      Department who are contracted by Haldimand County for Forestry
      Conservation issues:
             a.      Running lines or substations through woodlands should be
      avoided.
             b.      A Vegetation Management Plan for how the trees-that are
                     retainable, but close to the construction are to be protected.
             c.      Process for exemptions to the by-law for woodland
                     destruction if the line must go through a woodland and the
                     compensation rates (monetary or reforestation program) for
                     the loss of woodland.
             d.      Process for removal of trees along County road allowances
                     and compensation rates (monetary or part of a planting
                     program) for trees that are removed from the road
                     allowance.
             e.      A communication plan from the contractor for keeping the
                     public informed of tree removals or replanting.
The remaining comments specifically address key concerns identified by the
Haldimand County Engineering Services division .
14.   Nanticoke Water Treatment Plant and Source Water Protection
      Protecting the sources of our municipal drinking water is an important step
      toward ensuring that there is enough safe, clean drinking water for all. The
      Clean Water Act has been passed by the Ontario legislature to protect
      municipal drinking water sources throughout Ontario.
      The Nanticoke Water Treatment Plant (WTP) is located in Haldimand
      County and services 10,000 people, the Lake Erie Industrial Park (LEIP),
      the OPG site, as well as separate raw water lines supply the steel facility
      and the petroleum refinery. The Nanticoke WTP has two Type A (Great
      Lakes) intakes located approximately 465m apart in Lake Erie and one
      typeD intake located at the Industrial Pumping Station (IPS). The
      locations of the intakes are identified in Figure 1. below. The west and
      east in-lake intake cribs for the Nanticoke WTP are located approximately
      500m and 520m offshore at a depths of 6.3m.

Drinking water source protection plans identify the risks to municipal water
quality and water supplies, and the policies and programs that will reduce
the risks. The Source Protection Plan for the Long Point Region
Watershed was approved by the Ontario Ministry of Environment and
Climate Change on Nov. 4, 2015. The document is published online and
can be viewed at https://www.sourcewater.ca/en/source-protection-
areas/Long-Poi nt-Reg ion-Source-Protection-PIan. aspx
**Note: Please see Attachment # 1 Long Point Region Source Protection
Plan Approved Plan Volume 2 and Attachment# 2 Long Point Region
Source Approved Assessment Report attached under separate cover.
The HVDC cable proposed route is approximately 1OOm west of the
westerly most intake. It is not expected that the alignment or existence of
the HVDC cable would constitute a hazard, however, the following
construction activities may.
A.      The proposed HOD operation from the terrestrial landfall to Lake
        Erie involves the use of a drilling fluid. Section 6.1 of the
            Environment and Socia Economic Assessment identifies the
           potential for inadvertent fluid release into the environment or
           through natural fissures in bedrock. This may result in hazardous
           impacts to the IPS and the Nanticoke WTP in-lake intakes.
           • HOD drilling operations were not contemplated during the formulation
               of the Source Water Protection Plan. Analysis of the construction
                activities should be completed in consultation with the Lake Erie
                Source Protection Committee.
,I
     RECOMMENDED CONDITION OF APPROVAL: That analysis of the
     construction activities relating to the HOD drilling operations are
     completed in consultation with the Lake Erie Source Protection
     Committee.
     B.    The proposed underwater installation operation for the HVDC cable
           involves fluidization of in-situ lakebed. Section 6.2.2 of the
           Environment and Socia Economic Assessment identifies the
           following.
           • A water quality model of Lake Erie (Annex 26) was developed to
               assess the potential water quality impacts associated with the
                re-suspension of sediments during the cable installation. The
               water quality modelling was completed to show the
               concentration increases associated with the cable installation at
               five representative location for the following parameters: TSS;
               Total Phosphorus(TP); Dissolved Phosphorous (DP); arsenic;
               cadmium; chromium; copper; lead; nickel; zinc; and mercury.
           •   The results from the water quality modelling have shown that
               minimal water quality impacts are associated with the HVDC
               cable installation in Lake Erie and they are limited to temporary
                impacts that would occur locally within a four hour time frame.
           •   The installation of a HVDC cable under the lakebed may have
....
               hazardous impacts to the intakes for the Nanticoke WTP. Offshore
               construction activities were not contemplated during the formulation of
               the Source Water Protection Plan. Analysis of the construction
               activities should be completed in consultation with the Lake Erie
               Source Protection Committee.
     RECOMMENDED CONDITION OF APPROVAL: That analysis of the
     construction activities relating to the underwater HVDC cable are
     completed in consultation with the Lake Erie Source Protection
     Committee.
     C.    The proposed trench and HOD installation of the HVDC and AC
           cables will cross the into Intake Protection Zone for the Industrial
           Pumping Station (IPS) and directly cross the raw water line.
                                                                                             l
               •  The installation of the HVDC and AC cables may have hazardous
                  impacts on the IPS. HOD drilling operations were not contemplated
                  during the formulation of the Source Water Protection Plan. Analysis
                  of the construction activities should be completed in consultation with
                  the Lake Erie Source Protection Committee.
      RECOMMENDED CONDITION OF APPROVAL:
                       iii.   That analysis of the construction activities
                              relating to the terrestrial HVDC cable and HOD
                              drilling operations are completed in consultation
                              with the Lake Erie Source Protection Committee.
                       iv.    That a crossing agreement is negotiated with
                              Haldimand County that places the minimum
                              separation distance of the terrestrial HVDC and
                              AC cables below the existing raw water line to the
                              Industrial Pumping Station (IPS).
  15. Nanticoke Water Treatment Plant and Future Expansion
      Long term planning of municipal drinking water is an important step toward
      ensuring that there is enough safe, clean drinking water for all. Haldimand
      County has developed a long term strategy for the projected needs of its
      residents.
      The Nanticoke WTP was constructed in 1977 on the shores of Lake Erie.
      The plant supplies raw water from the Industrial Pumping Station (IPS) to
j     two industries and the interim treatment facility provides treated water to
      approximately 10,000 residents in the communities of Jarvis, Townsend
      and Hagersville in Haldimand County as well as the Mississaugas of New
      Credit First Nation. The plant was originally constructed for future
      expansions to meet the needs of a larger supply area up to Waterloo
      Region. Figure 3-9 is an excerpt from the Nanticoke Grand Valley Area
      Water Supply (NGVAWS) Project Feasibility Study prepared by Genivar in
      2009 showing the potential infrastructure and service area for the eventual
      full build out of the project.
                                                                                          •

            ( ,1 1\ \~   .....  -
  Haldimand County has reserved the west half of Haldimand Road 55 for
  the future expansion of the Nanticoke WTP and implementation of the
  NGVAWS. The expansion may begin as early as the year 2021, and
  includes the construction of twin 1200mm Dia transmission watermain an
  invert depth of 4.5m. The lTC Lake Erie Connector project has identified
  terrestrial AC and HVDC cable route within the ROW of Haldimand Road
  55 at depth of 1-2m.
  The lTC Lake Erie project will have the following impacts on the long term
  plan for the Nanticoke WTP.
  A. The Terrestrial HVDC and AC cables will cross the corridor for the
      transmission watermain.
  B. The AC and HVDC cable installation is in conflict with the construction
      trench of the transmission watermain.
        C. The vertical clearance of the AC and HVDC cables are not identified in
           the supplied report.
       D. The HVDC and AC cables should be installed at a depth that allows
           the construction of the transmission watermain free and clear of the
           clearance zone of the HVDC cable crossing under Haldimand Road
           55.
       RECOMMENDED CONDITION OF APPROVAL: That a crossing
       agreement is negotiated with Haldimand County that places the
       minimum separation distance of the terrestrial HVDC and AC cables
       below the construction trench of the planned transmission
       watermain.
16.    Haldimand Road 55 Right of Way (ROW) and Existing Utilities
       The Environmental and Socia Economic Assessment Section 6.2.1.16
       Infrastructure and Services report identifies existing utilities within the
       easterly half of the Haldimand Road 55 ROW. The lTC Lake Erie
       Connector has proposed to trench construct a HVDC and AC cable line
       within the easterly half of the Haldimand Road 55 ROW. The depth of
       installation of the cables is proposed at 1-2m and the trenches installed at
       a separation of 7m.
       The lTC Lake Erie project will have the following impacts on the long term
       plan for Haldimand Road 55 and the utilities in the Road Right of Way.
       A. A raw water line and underground bell infrastructure have been
           identified in the ROW
       B. A buried Union Gas Transmission line has not been identified
       RECOMMENDED CONDITION OF APPROVAL:
               vi.     That municipal consent is received from Haldimand
                       County for the installation of the HVDC cable within the
                       road allowance of Haldimand Road 55.
               vii.    That further study of the existing buried infrastructure
                       along the route of the terrestrial cables is completed and
                       submitted to Haldimand County.
               viii.   That crossing/occupancy agreements are negotiated
                       with the existing utilities identifying a minimum
                       separation distance of the existing utilities and the
                       terrestrial HVDC and AC cables.

 Long Point Region Source Protection Plan                                        Volume II – Approved
1.0        INTRODUCTION
The Long Point Region Source Protection Plan is a document that contains policies to protect
sources of drinking water against existing and future drinking water threats prescribed in the
Clean Water Act, 2006 within the Long Point Region watershed.
The Source Protection Plan is comprised of two volumes and accompanied by an Explanatory
Document. This second volume of the Source Protection Plan contains the Source Protection
Plan policies. The policies are assigned a legal effect and direct implementing bodies to comply
with, conform with, or have regard to these policies. Some policies are non-legally binding.
Below is a brief description of what is included in Volume I and the Explanatory Document.
Volume I
Volume I of the Source Protection Plan provides the context for the plan, which includes a brief
history of source protection planning and the Clean Water Act, 2006, Source Protection Plan
objectives, and a description of the watershed/source protection area.
The Updated Long Point Region Source Protection Area Assessment Report, approved by the
Ministry of the Environment on February 23, 2012, is a key component of the Source Protection
Plan. This assessment report forms the basis of the Source Protection Plan and provides
information, including mapping, for understanding its objectives and policies. Further updates
were made between its approval in 2012 and March 2015. These updates have been
incorporated into the Updated Assessment Report, which was posted for a 30-day public
consultation period beginning on February 9, 2015. The Updated Long Point Region
Assessment Report was re-submitted to the Ministry of the Environment for their review and
approval on June 3, 2015. The full report is available online at www.sourcewater.ca.
Explanatory Document
Section 40 of O. Reg. 287/07 under the Clean Water Act, 2006 requires an Explanatory
Document be prepared and submitted with the Source Protection Plan. The Explanatory
Document is not part of the Source Protection Plan; however, it provides interested parties with
the rationale used by the policy makers when developing the Source Protection Plan policies.
Further, the Explanatory Document summarizes the key factors considered when selecting
policy approaches.
1.1     Source Protection Plan- Legal Effect
As required by the Clean Water Act, 2006, the Source Protection Plan policies must identify who
or what agency will be responsible for implementation. The legal effect describes whether there
is an obligation for the responsible party to implement the policy. Three factors determine the
legal effect of a policy: 1) the policy tool, 2) the threat ranking (significant / moderate / low), and
3) the implementing body. For example, a specify action policy could direct a municipality to
comply with a significant drinking water threat policy, whereas a Provincial Ministry would not be
legally bound to comply with the policy. This information is presented in the Legal Effect Matrix,
included in Appendix C of Volume I.
November 4, 2015                                                                          Section 1-1
 Long Point Region Source Protection Plan                                    Volume II – Approved
Part III (Effect of Source Protection Plans) of the Clean Water Act, 2006 gives the Source
Protection Plan and its policies their various legal effects. Within Part III, certain provisions
require specific statutory decisions to conform to or comply with the significant threat policies;
therefore, the implementing bodies have an obligation to implement the Source Protection Plan
policies. The Ministry of the Environment provided direction under section 34 of O. Reg. 287/07
to ensure a consistent method of identifying the policies’ legal effect under one or more
provisions of Part III of the Clean Water Act, 2006. The following is included in Appendix A of
Volume II.
List A Significant threat policies that affect decisions under the Planning Act and Condominium
        Act, 1998
List B Moderate and low threat policies that affect decisions under the Planning Act and
        Condominium Act, 1998
List C Significant threat policies that affect prescribed instrument decisions
List D Moderate and low threat policies that affect prescribed instrument decisions
List E Significant threat policies that impose obligations on municipalities, source protection
        authorities and local boards
List F Monitoring policies referred to in subsection 22(2) of the Clean Water Act, 2006
List G Policies related to section 57 of the Clean Water Act, 2006
List H Policies related to section 58 of the Clean Water Act, 2006
List I Policies related to section 59 of the Clean Water Act, 2006
List J Strategic Action policies
List K Significant threat policies targeted to bodies other than municipalities, local board or
        source protection authorities for implementation
In addition to the lists above, two tables are included which identify the type of prescribed
instrument that the policy affects, in relation to Lists C and D, and a summary of all the policies
with respect to the above lists. These tables are presented in Appendix B of Volume II.
The Clean Water Act, 2006 identifies policy tools to address the prescribed drinking water
threats identified in O. Reg. 287/07. This Volume contains the policies developed to address
existing and future drinking water threats within the Long Point Region Source Protection Area.
November 4, 2015                                                                        Section 1-2

2.0        HOW TO READ THE SOURCE PROTECTION PLAN POLICIES
There are four municipalities with a drinking water systems located within the Long Point Region
Source Protection Area. This Source Protection Plan has been divided into municipal sections
containing the applicable Source Protection Plan policies for each of the respective
municipalities. Further information and rationale is included in Volume I of the Source Protection
Plan and in the Explanatory Document.
2.1     Policy Format
Each policy addresses significant drinking water threats as per the Ministry of the Environment’s
Table of Prescribed Threats. In most cases the Ministry of the Environment’s Prescribed
Drinking Water Threat is stated within the policy and it is understood that this will include all
sub-threats as listed in the Assessment Report in accordance with the Clean Water Act, 2006
Provincial Tables of Circumstances available online at www.sourcewater.ca. These prescribed
drinking water threats are also described in the Source Protection Plan - Volume I.
The policies in the Long Point Region Source Protection Plan are organized by municipality
similar to that presented in the Assessment Report. Each municipal section contains the
following information:
       Municipal Specific Definitions
       Municipal Specific Source Protection Plan Policies
       Municipal Policies addressing Prescribed Drinking Water Threats
       Appendix A:
            o List of Policies as per Section 34 of O. Reg. 287/07

In some cases, policies have been included in this Source Protection Plan, even though it is in
the opinion of the municipalities and the Source Protection Committee that certain activities are
unlikely to occur in the future. Policies addressing potential future drinking water threats are
required to be included in the Source Protection Plan, as per the objectives outlined in the Clean
Water Act, 2006.
2.2     Policy Identifier
To assist the reader, an identifier has been used for each policy. The identifier specifies the
system/ policy location, policy number, and its legal effect (i.e., OC-CW-1.0).
The system/ policy location is identified first:
       OC – County of Oxford
       NC – Norfolk County
       HC – Haldimand County
       EC – Elgin County
The legal effect follows the policy location identifier and is designated as follows:

 Long Point Region Source Protection Plan                                                             Volume II – Approved
          CW – Comply With
          MC – Must Conform
         NB – Non-legally Binding
Each policy is numbered sequentially.
Significant threat policies address existing drinking water threats, potential future threats, or
both. The policy text also includes the agency responsible for implementation.
2.2.1 Legal Effects
A description of the legal effects is presented below and the associated legal effect policy matrix
is presented in Volume I for reference.
The policies in the Source Protection Plan have one of three types of legal effect – “must
conform/comply with” policies, “have regard to” policies, and “non-legally binding” policies. The
following is an explanation of which policies fall under each legal effect provision. The
appendices of the Source Protection Plan also contain lists of policies ensuring Source
Protection Plan policies are designated the appropriate legal effect provision as outlined in the
Clean Water Act, 2006. Specific reference to these lists is included in the definitions below,
where applicable.
Must Conform (MC) / Comply With (CW)
      The Clean Water Act, 2006 requires municipalities, local boards, or source protection
          authorities to comply with any obligations imposed on it to address a significant drinking
          water threat (activity/condition), regardless of the particular tool or approach used in the
          policy (see List E).
         The Clean Water Act, 2006 requires decisions under the Planning Act and Condominium
          Act to conform with a significant drinking water threat (activity/condition) policies (see
          List A).
         The Clean Water Act, 2006 requires decisions related to prescribed instruments to
          conform with a significant drinking water threat (activity/condition) policies (see List C).
         Persons carrying out significant threat activities must comply with policies that use
          Part IV powers under the Clean Water Act, 2006.
         The Source Protection Plan must designate a public body1 to carry out monitoring
          required by the Clean Water Act, 2006 and these public bodies must conform with the
          obligations set out in the monitoring policies (see List F).
1
  Public body is defined in section 2 of the CWA and means “a municipality, local board or conservation authority, a ministry, board,
commission, agency or official of the Government of Ontario, or a body prescribed by the regulations”. Based on this definition, a
commission like the Niagara Escarpment Commission is a public body, whereas any federal government ministry and the Technical
Standards and Safety Authority (TSSA) are not.

 Long Point Region Source Protection Plan                                        Volume II – Approved
Non-legally Binding (NB)
The Source Protection Plan includes other types of policies that, while the Source Protection
Committee has determined are important to achieving the Plan’s objectives, are not given legal
effect by the Clean Water Act, 2006. These may include:
       Significant, moderate and low drinking water threats and/or condition policies to be
        implemented by bodies other than municipalities, local boards or source protection
        authorities, and which do not rely on Part IV or the Clean Water Act, 2006, prescribed
        instruments or Planning Act and Condominium Act tools.
       Other permitted policies governing:
            o   Incentive programs and education & outreach programs, not aimed towards a
                specific threat activity or Condition including those for systems not in terms of
                reference
            o   The update of spills prevention, contingency or response plans along highways,
                railways or shipping lanes
            o   Climate conditions data collection
            o   Transport pathways in WHPA or IPZ.
       Optional monitoring policies (i.e. moderate/low drinking water threats in areas where the
        threat could never become significant and monitoring of other permissible plan policies)
        to be implemented by bodies other than municipality, local boards or source protection
        authorities.
Not all policy options mentioned above have been included in the Long Point Region Source
Protection Plan. Volume I of the Source Protection Plan provides additional detail on optional
content and what has and has not been included in the Source Protection Plan.
2.3     Sidebar
Information is provided in a sidebar below the Policy Identifier to provide a quick reference for
the reader when reviewing the Source Protection Plan Policies. The sidebar does not form part
of the Source Protection Plan Policies and specifies the following:
       Whether the policy will apply to existing activities, future activities, or both.
       The policy tool that is being applied to manage or prohibit the activity (a summary of the
        policy tools is presented in Volume I of this Source Protection Plan).
       The vulnerable area where the policy will apply, including the vulnerability score, if
        applicable.
The following acronyms were used to present this information:
     WHPA: Wellhead Protection Area
     IPZ: Intake Protection Zone
     Part IV- RMP: Part IV of the Clean Water Act, 2006, Risk Management Plan
     Part IV- RLU: Part IV of the Clean Water Act, 2006, Restricted Land Use
     Prescribed Instr.: Prescribed Instrument (e.g., Environmental Compliance Approval)
     -v. #: Applicable vulnerability score where the policy will apply
     -10: Applicable vulnerability score where the policy will apply
     ICA- Issue Contributing Area
     (NIT)- Nitrate

2.4      Policy Applicability Mapping
Policy applicability mapping has been provided in the Schedules to aid the reader in determining
where Source Protection Plan policies apply. This mapping is based on the Approved
Assessment Report mapping, modified to indicate where the Source Protection Plan policies
may apply, based on the Tables of Drinking Water Threats under the Clean Water Act, 2006.
The purpose of this mapping is to provide a summary of the circumstances presented in the
Table of Drinking Water Threats. As indicated on the Policy Applicability Map, each vulnerability
score is associated with a colour. This colour is then reflected in the summary table provided on
the map to indicate which potential drinking water threats would apply to a specific location.
To determine if a policy applies, the policy text, the Assessment Report mapping and the Tables
of Drinking Water Threats (specific circumstances) should be consulted. A summary on how to
read the Source Protection Plan is provided in Volume I.
The Tables of Drinking Water Threats, Clean Water Act, 2006 and the Approved Assessment
Report are available online at www.sourcewater.ca .
2.5      Monitoring of Significant Drinking Water Threat Policies
Activities that are or would be significant drinking water threats must be monitored and the
effectiveness of the policy at addressing a significant drinking water threat must be evaluated.
This evaluation will help the Source Protection Committee determine if the threat policy is
effective and/ or if revisions to the policy(ies) would be required in future updates of the Source
Protection Plans. The same monitoring policy may be used to monitor one or more drinking
water threat policies.

                          b. Notwithstanding the definition of existing, where a significant drinking water
                               threat activity is directly related to a land use permitted by existing zoning and
                               does not require any approvals under the Planning Act or Ontario Building
                               Code Act to be lawfully established on a property, such activity shall be
                               considered existing for the purposes of compliance with the applicable
                               significant drinking water threat policies. This provision shall cease to apply at
                               such time as a Risk Management Inspector has conducted a property specific
                               assessment and documented the significant drinking water threat activities
                               that are undertaken or established on a property as of that point in time,
                               following which any significant drinking water threat activity not so
                               documented shall be considered new or future.
                          c. Notwithstanding the definition of existing, where a significant drinking water
                               threat activity is being proposed by way of a new or amended Prescribed
                               Instrument, it shall be considered existing for the purposes of complying with
                               the applicable significant drinking water threat policies provided that the
                               application for the new or amended Prescribed Instrument was deemed to be
                               complete by the applicable approval authority as of the date this Source
                               Protection Plan takes effect.
                        Note: the order of the above paragraphs (ii – iv) has been modified.

                        permitted to make the determination that a site specific land use is not designated
                        for the purposes of section 59. Where such direction has been issued, a site
                        specific land use that is the subject of an application for approval under the
                        Planning Act or for a permit under the Building Code Act is not designated for the
                        purposes of Section 59, provided that the planning authority or building official, as
                        applicable, is satisfied that:
                          a. the application complies with the written direction issued by the Risk
                               Management Official; and
                          b. the applicant has demonstrated that a significant drinking water threat activity
                               designated for the purposes of section 57 or 58 will not be engaged in, or will
                               not be affected by the application.
 Official Plan and Zoning By-law Amendment(s) Policies
 OC-MC-1.4              The County shall amend the Official Plan and the Area Municipalities shall amend

 BACKGROUND:
Haldimand County recently received a Notice of Public Hearing and Application to Participate re:
ITC Lake Erie Connector International Power Line Project from the National Energy Board. The
purpose of this report is to provide Council with an overview of the proposed ITC Lake Erie
Connector project and an overview of the hearing process.
ANALYSIS:
Project Description
ITC Lake Erie Connector LLC (ITC Lake Erie or ITC) is proposing to construct, own and operate
an international power line called the Lake Erie Connector (the Lake Erie Connector or Project).
ITC is the largest independent electric transmission company in the United States. The Lake Erie
Connector will transfer electricity between Canada (Haldimand County, Ontario) and the United
States (Erie County, Pennsylvania).
The Project will be the first direct interconnection between the Independent Electricity System
Operator (IESO) market in Ontario and the PJM Interconnection LLC (PJM) market in the U.S.
mid-Atlantic and Midwest. Once constructed, the Project will be incorporated into the Ontario
electricity grid (which is owned by Hydro One Networks Inc. (Hydro One) and managed by the
IESO) and the PJM electricity grid in the United States.
ITC Lake Erie has applied to the National Energy Board (NEB) for a certificate authorizing the
construction and operation of the Project (the NEB Application or Application). The NEB will
conduct a public hearing process which will consider, among other things, any environmental
impacts of the Project.
The Lake Erie Connector will be an approximately 117 km 1,000 megawatt (MW) ±320 kilovolt
(kV) high-voltage direct current (HVDC) bi-directional electric transmission interconnection. The
Project has three main components: HVDC converter stations in Ontario and Pennsylvania;
terrestrial cable systems; and underwater cable systems. Table 1 provides an overview of the
location, scope and specifications of the Project components in Haldimand County.
     Table 1           Overview of Lake Erie Connector Components in Haldimand County
 Components located in Canada                                                     Area/Length
Project components in Haldimand County:
  HVDC Converter Station – Haldimand County, Ontario                               7.5 ha
  Terrestrial 500 kV AC Cable Route – Haldimand County, Ontario                    1.3 km
  Terrestrial ±320 kV HVDC Cable Route – Haldimand County, Ontario                 1.3 km
  Underwater ±320 kV HVDC Cable Route (Preferred Route) – Canada                   46.8 km
The Canadian HVDC converter station (Haldimand Converter Station) will be located on private
property on the west side of Haldimand Road #55 south of Rainham Road near a point of
interconnection (POI) in Haldimand County, close to the Nanticoke transformer station (TS)
switchyard. A 500 kV alternating current (AC) underground transmission cable will connect the
Haldimand Converter Station to the POI via the east side of Haldimand Road #55 right of way.
The Haldimand Converter Station will convert 500 kV AC power to ±320 kV direct current (DC)
Council                                                                        Report: PED-EDT-16-2015
Date of Meeting: November 23, 2015                                                         Page 2 of 11
 power or vice versa. (Attachment 2 indicates the location of the Haldimand Converter Station
and cables in Haldimand County.)
The HVDC transmission line will consist of two transmission cables, one positively charged and
the other negatively charged along with a fibre optic cable for communications between the two
converter stations. The HVDC transmission cables will run underground from the Haldimand
Converter Station along the east side of Haldimand Road #55 roadway right-of-way to the
shoreline of Lake Erie; it will enter under the shoreline into the lake; and, it will then be buried in
the lakebed and will cross the lake to Erie, Pennsylvania.
Project construction is anticipated to begin in Q2 2017 and will take approximately two to three
years to complete, with an anticipated in-service date in Q4 2019. The project schedule may be
adjusted due to market conditions, engineering design, and/or permitting. The Project has a
minimum 30-year design life.
Following, are some of the key items identified during an earlier meeting between staff and the
proponents. If Council approves the participation in the Public Hearing process, these items are
intended to be incorporated into a letter of comment forwarded by Haldimand County.
    1. Official Plan Policy: In the Haldimand County Official Plan, the subject lands intended for
         the Converter Station are designated Agriculture. The Haldimand County Official Plan
         policy permits the location of power lines and related substations in all land use
         designations. Therefore, the proposal conforms to the Official Plan policy.
    2. Zoning: All three lots in the subject lands are zoned ‘Agricultural (A) Zone. The zoning by-
         law permits power lines and the related substations in all zones.
    3. Site Plan Control: Being a development of industrial nature, the construction of the
         Converter Station will be subject to site plan control. A site plan application would be
         required to address issues such as entrance, drainage, stormwater management, parking,
         fire-safety, waste-disposal, landscaping, environmental and archaeological assessment,
         and conformity with surrounding land uses. Appropriate securities will be obtained and a
         site plan agreement will be signed and registered on title to make sure that the proposed
         development proceeds as per approved site plan.
    4. Minor Variance Application: A minor variance application will be required to seek relief of
         the related provisions of the ‘Agricultural (A)’ Zone of the City of Nanticoke Zoning By-law
         for the height of the Converter Station building, and possibly the deficient setback from the
         western property line.
    5. Severance/Leasing: No severance application will be required as (according to the
         proponent) the whole property containing 39 acres has been purchased for the project.
         While roughly 6 acres will be utilized for the Convertor Station, the rest will be leased out
         for farming.
    6. Servicing capacity allocation: It is yet indeterminate if servicing will be required for the
         proposed Converter Station. In case servicing is required here, only municipal water may
         be available in the area. For the sanitary needs, private septic system will need to be
         installed.
    7. The road use matters will require the execution of a land use agreement with County for
         which the Council’s approval (for use over 25 years) will be required. The agreement will
         need to be customized by the proponent’s lawyer and Haldimand County’s lawyer.
Council                                                                            Report: PED-EDT-16-2015
Date of Meeting: November 23, 2015                                                             Page 3 of 11
     8. While a Traffic Impact Study will not be required, a Traffic Control Plan, will be required
         during construction which the proponent is to prepare in consultation with Haldimand
         County Public Works, Engineering Services and Development and Design Division.
    9. Road Entrance Permits are required for any entrances. Road Excavation Permit will be
         required for all work within the road right of way. A traffic control plan is required for review
         for the construction process and to ensure all lines are locatable and road crossings are
         identified in drawings and onsite.
    10. The preference would be siting the cable wholly within the Haldimand Road # 55 road
         allowance. This would be the simplest solution as no easement would be required to be
         registered on title. It may also be supported if the easement would extend beyond the
         road allowance on to the easterly boundary of the lands owned by Haldimand County.
    11. The following items were raised by Norfolk County’s Community Services Department who
         are contracted by Haldimand County for Forestry Conservation issues:
              a. Running lines or substations through woodlands should be avoided.
              b. A Vegetation Management Plan for how the trees that are retainable, but close to
                   the construction are to be protected.
              c. Process for exemptions to the by-law for woodland destruction if the line must go
                   through a woodland and the compensation rates (monetary or reforestation
                   program) for the loss of woodland.
              d. Process for removal of trees along County road allowances and compensation
                   rates (monetary or part of a planting program) for trees that are removed from the
                   road allowance.
              e. A communication plan from the contractor for keeping the public informed of tree
                   removals or replanting.
National Energy Board Hearing Process Overview
The National Energy Board (NEB) has a responsibility to regulate the construction and operation
of certain interprovincial and international pipelines and power-lines. The NEB will hold a public
hearing for the ITC Lake Erie Connector Project and will conduct an environmental assessment
pursuant to the National Energy Board Act. The NEB must hear from anyone directly affected by
the project and may hear from those who have relevant information or expertise.
A panel, representing the Board will review the proposed project and will decide whether or not a
Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity should be issued. The Board will hold a public
hearing to consider this project. During the hearing process, the Board will receive written
evidence that will be available in an online public registry on the Board’s website. The hearing
may also include oral portions.
The Board has identified but does not limit itself to, the following issues for consideration in the
hearing with respect to the construction and operation of the proposed Lake Erie Connector
International Power Line Project.
    1.   The need for the Project.
    2.   The economic feasibility of the Project.
    3.   The potential commercial impacts of the Project.
    4.   The suitability of the design, construction and operation of the Project.
    5.   Safety and security during construction and operation of the Project, including emergency
         response planning and third-party damage prevention.
    6. Potential impact on the bulk power system, including neighbouring jurisdictions.
Council                                                                              Report: PED-EDT-16-2015
Date of Meeting: November 23, 2015                                                               Page 4 of 11
     7. The potential environmental and socio-economic effects of the Project, including any
         cumulative environmental effects that are likely to result from the Project, including those
         required to be considered by the NEB’s Electricity Filing Manual.
    8. The appropriateness of the general route and land requirements for the Project.
    9. Potential impacts of the Project on landowners and the use of lands and waters.
    10. The terms and conditions to be included in any recommendation or approval the Board
         may issue.
Those wishing to participate must apply by submitting an online application form. The application
deadline is November 27, 2015. There is a section within the application which applicants are
asked to describe how it is that they are “directly affected”, or how they have “relevant information
or expertise”. The response needs to relate to at least one of the items on the list of issues for
the project as noted above. The NEB will review each application and will inform everyone who
applied whether or not they will be allowed to participate and how.
There are typically two ways to participate in a hearing:
1. Commenter – share views on the project with the NEB in a written Letter of Comment.
        A Letter of Comment is a way of sharing our views on the project with the Board in writing.
         We will not be able to ask questions about other people’s evidence or make a final
         argument.
        If the Board decides that we may participate by writing a Letter of Comment, we may then
         submit a letter.
        The NEB will not accept unsolicited Letters of Comment and they will not be placed on the
         record for the hearing if sent by anyone who is not a participant.
        Letters of Comment will not be considered sworn evidence and are not subject to
         questioning. As a result, Letters of Comment may not be given the same weight as sworn
         evidence that has been tested through questioning in a hearing.
        Letters of Comment that are properly filed become public documents once they have been
         submitted and are able to be viewed on the public registry, accessible through the NEB’s
         website.
2. Intervenor – ask questions, present evidence, answer questions about evidence provided and
   give a final argument.
        An Intervenor, has the right to receive all of the documents filed during the hearing
         process.
        During the hearing process, an Intervenor may have the opportunity to present written
         evidence, question others on their written evidence, cross-examine other witnesses at the
         oral portion of the hearing, and give final argument. Intervenors may also be questioned
         on any evidence that we present.
        While Intervenors are not be required to attend the entire oral portion of the hearing, the
         need to attend at the beginning of the first day to register their appearance and tell the
         Board how much the level of participation for example, whether they intend on questioning
         all of the company’s witnesses or only some of them.
Given the nature of the issues, that the land use policy supports the principle of the project and
that there is no direct municipal approval role, it is suggested that the County limit its role to that
of a Commenter as set out above.

Manitoba Hydro Interest in Matter
Manitoba Hydro is a provincial Crown Corporation established pursuant to The Manitoba Hydro Act. [1]
Manitoba Hydro engages in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity to customers in the
Province of Manitoba, other Canadian provinces and wholesale customers in the United States. Manitoba
Hydro has an interest in this matter primarily as it relates to the potential impacts of the Project on
Manitoba’s electrical system. The Board has indicated that the potential impact of the Project on the bulk
power system, including neighboring jurisdictions, is one of the issues they seek comment on in their
evaluation of the Project. Manitoba Hydro is located in a neighboring jurisdiction and has an electrical system
that is directly interconnected to the electrical system of Ontario and as such is potentially impacted by the

Background
On May 22, 2015, ITC Lake Erie Connector LLC (“ITC Lake Erie”) submitted an application [2] to the National
Energy Board (the “NEB” or the “Board”) for approval to construct and operate the ITC Lake Erie Connector
International Power Line (as more fully described in the Application, the “Project”).
On October 21, 2015, the Board provided a letter to ITC Lake Erie indicating that they had determined the
application by ITC Lake Erie to be complete to proceed to assessment and on the same date, the NEB issued a
Notice of Public Hearing and Application to Participate. [3] In the Letter, the NEB directed ITC Lake Erie to
distribute a copy of the Notice of Public Hearing and Application to Participate to a number of persons and
groups, one of whom was Manitoba Hydro.
On November 27, 2015, Manitoba Hydro applied to participate in the NEB proceeding on the Project and on
December 15, 2015, Manitoba Hydro received notice from the NEB that Manitoba Hydro had been granted
status as a Commenter in the above mentioned proceeding.
We thank the NEB for the opportunity to participate in this matter and provide our comments on the Project.
Comment
In the Hearing Order, the NEB identified a list of issues it would consider in the hearing related to the Project
which included, among other things the potential impact of the Project on the bulk power system, including
neighboring jurisdictions [4].
Pursuant to the National Energy Board Electricity Regulations, an application for a permit for the construction
and operation of an international power line that exceeds an operating voltage of 50 kV, such as the
Application, is required to contain, among other things, a description of any adverse effects that operation
of the proposed international power line may have, including adverse effects on the operation of power
systems in other provinces, and the measures to be taken to mitigate or minimize those effects. [5] The
Independent Electricity System Operator (“IESO”), the entity that conducted the system impact assessment
study on behalf of ITC Lake Erie (the “Study”), [6] describes a system impact assessment study as consisting
of the review of the proposed connection arrangement and its impact on the reliability of the integrated
power system, which includes transmission systems outside of Ontario. [7] Given those requirements, and
given Manitoba’s geographic proximity to the proposed Project and the interconnection that the Manitoba
electrical system shares with the Ontario electrical system, Manitoba Hydro would have expected the
Manitoba electrical system to be considered in the Study. However, there is no indication in the Report that
Manitoba was considered in the Study, and if it were considered, the results of that analysis. At no time was
Manitoba Hydro contacted regarding coordination of the Study, to verify information or otherwise. In this
regard, Manitoba Hydro respectfully submits that the application of ITC Lake Erie for the Project is
incomplete.
Manitoba Hydro is concerned that Manitoba was apparently not considered in the IESO’s analysis as

 Manitoba Hydro believes there is potential that the Project may impact the electrical system in Manitoba.
The Report discusses the impact of the Project on the existing interconnections between Ontario and other
jurisdictions. [8] Manitoba is identified in the Application as an existing intertie of Ontario; however,
Manitoba is not included in the Report’s discussion of the impacts of the Project on interconnected
jurisdictions. [9]
There is a pre-existing issue, and related concern in the industry, with respect to the excessive loop flow on
the transmission lines that encircle the Great Lakes. The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has
considered the issue in recent years and indicated the following: “Power flows over the path of least
resistance, and, as a result, it may not flow over the path for which it is scheduled by a transmission
operator. This difference between actual and scheduled flow on a path or interface is called loop flow, and
has historically been both common and extremely volatile in the Lake Erie region. This situation has been
referred to generally as the Lake Erie loop flow issue. ” [10]
As a result, affected utilities (including Manitoba Hydro) have invested in phase shifting transformers in order
to mitigate this loop flow issue. Manitoba Hydro is concerned that the Project may contribute to the existing
loop flow problem around the Great Lakes area and cause more frequent off-load phase shift tap
adjustments on the phase shifting transformers located in Manitoba. There is also the potential that
excessive loop flow on the Ontario-Minnesota ties could affect the reliability of the Ontario-Manitoba ties. In
Manitoba Hydro’s opinion, the effect of the Project on this loop flow issue has not been adequately
demonstrated by ITC Lake Erie in their submissions to the Board.
Request of Manitoba Hydro
Therefore, Manitoba Hydro respectfully recommends that any Order issued by the Board to ITC Lake Erie
with respect to the Project be made conditional upon the demonstration by ITC Lake Erie, to the satisfaction
of Manitoba Hydro, of the impact of the Project on the Manitoba electrical system including analysis of the
impact on both the Ontario-Manitoba ties and Ontario-Minnesota ties.
Again, we thank the Board for the opportunity to comment in this matter and communicate our concerns.
Please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned should you require any further information or have any
questions whatsoever.

   This Letter of Comment serves to provide recommendations to the National Energy Board
  (NEB) with the goal of minimizing the potential adverse effects on areas of the
  environment relating to ECCC's mandate.
  Migratory Birds
  ECCC's MBR provides for the conservation of migratory birds, individuals, their nests and
 eggs. Attempting in any manner to kill, injure or harass migratory birds, as well as the
 disturbance, destruction, or taking of a nest, egg or nest shelter of a migratory bird is
 prohibited. This prohibition applies throughout the year.
 With respect to the terrestrial components of the project, sensory disturbances due to the
 operation of the converter station in close proximity to a wooded area were examined by
the proponent as a potential chronic disturbance to migratory birds. A 50 decibelthreshõH
 is often used to determine potential noise effects to migratory birds. Almost the entire
wooded area falls within the modelled 50 decibel isopleth. The migratory bird assemblage
as detected through breeding bird surveys is composed of species tolerant to backgrouñd
noise. While the additional noise from the converter station is unlikely to impact migratory
bird individuals (because the birds are already conditioned to various background ño¡se in
the area), noise exceedances, especially infrequent occurrences have the þotential to
impact these individuals.
Project works and activities such as construction access to the site, site grubbing,
vegetation clearing, construction and maintenance, are potentially destructive and
disruptive to birds, their nests and eggs. Project activities should be avoided at key
locations and during key periods, such as breeding periods and periods of high usage,
such as migration and/orfeeding. These locations and periods vary by regiõn and-by
species. While avoidance is the best approach, appropriate preventive and mitigative
measures should be developed and implemented in order to minimize the risk oi adverse
effects to migratory birds and the risk of "incidental take".
Migratory Bird Protection Recommendations
    1   Eccc expects proponents to develop and implement a management plan that
        effectively avoids or minimizes the risk of negative effects to migratory birds, their
        nests and eggs.
        a.  ECCC does not recommend the use of nest surveys to determine whether
            nests are present (with the exception of a few circumstances, e.g., nests in
            open areas, when the birds nest on isolated trees, on man-made structures
            and/or in colonies). The risk of disturbing nests (which is a contravention of the
            MBCA) is high during nest surveys. Additionally, there is a high probability of
            obtaining false negatives during nest surveys (i.e., a survey will determine that
            there are no nests present when in actuality there are nests in the surveyed
            habitat).
        b.
        '   ECCC considers non-intrusive searching methods such as using point counts
            placed along transects more in line withbur advice on determining whether
                                                 2
              nests are present in a forested area. These methods use singing territorial
             males as a proxy to establish whether the breeding season has started.
         c.  ECCC does not recommend establishing buffers around any nests identified
             through nest surveys. Because ECCC recommends non-intrusive searchíng
             methods in most instances, buffers are generally only appropriate as an
             avoidance toolwhen ilests are easily identified (such as nests in open areas,
             when the birds nest on isolated trees, on man-made structures and/or in
             colonies). ln other habitats, it is unlikely that nest surveys will detect all nests
             and thus buffers will not be established around all nests that are actually in the
             habitat.
         d.  ECCC does not recommend marking active nests with flagging tape, painted
             lath, or other similar material as this increases the risk of nest predation.
         e.  ln circumstances where nests are readily identified and can be monitored
             without disturbance to the nest, the proponent should consider submitting any
             completed nest records to the Ontario Nest Records Scheme.
 ECCC recommends that the proponent consult the guidance provided in the following
 websites:
 General Nesting Periods of Migratory Birds in Canada, ECCC has compiled core
 nesting periods to allow for work to be done outside of the nesting period. This does not
 mean there would not be nesting birds outside of these periods; it only reduces the risk
of encountering a nest.

Species at Risk
The purpose of SARA is to prevent wildlife species from being extirpated or becoming
extinct, to provide for the recovery of wildlife species that are extirpated, endangered or
                                                   3
   threatened as a result of human activity, and to manage species of special concern to
  prevent them from becoming endangered or threatened. Schedule 1 of SARA provides a
  list of wildlife species at risk in Canada that are considered extirpated, endangered,
  threatened, or of special concern. The SARA provides automatic protection for aquatic
  species and migratory birds protected under the MBCA, if they are listed as extirpated,
  endangered or threatened, whether these species are on federal or provincial lands.
  These prohibitions also apply to all other species listed as extirpated, endangered or
  threatened which are located on federal lands.
 The Little Brown Myotis and Northern Myotiswere recently listed as endangered under
  SARA and are also listed provincially under Ontario's Endangered SpeciesAcf. These
 species are likely to be found adjacent to the project area but are unlikely to be affected by the
  project activities. More information on SARA listed species, includin g Littte Brown Myotis
 and Northern Myotis can be found on EC's website at:
 http://www.sarareoistrv.oc.calsar/index/default e.cfm.
 The response to lnformation Request (lR) No.3 (A75347-16-01-29) provides additional
 information regarding the potential impacts on terrestrial wildlife including species at risk
 (SAR). The information contained within the lR substantiates that the project's effects
 are unlikely to impact SAR listed under Schedule 1 of SARA, should the project be
 implemented in a manner consistent with the application (and subsequent information)
 filed with the NEB. While project effects are unlikely, encounters with SAR are still
 possible.
 Species at Risk Protection Recommendations
     2.   lf any non-migratory bird or other terrestrial SAR individuals are encountered, the
          local Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry District Office should be
          contacted; and for any migratory bird sAR listed under schedule 1 of sARA,
          ECCC should be contacted by email at ec.faune.ontario-
         wildlife. ontario.ec@canada.ca or by phone at 905-33 6-4464.
 Long Point NationalWildlife Area
 NationalWildlife Areas (NWAs) are protected and managed according to the Wildlife Area
 Regulations under the canada wildlife Acf. The primary purpose of NWAs is the
protection and conservation of wildlife and their habitat. For this purpose, and according to
the legislation, ECCC can prohibit all activities in a NWA that could interfere with the
conservation of wildlife.
The Long Point National Wildlife Area is adjacent to the project site. The NWA covers 3560
ha of the Long Point peninsula, which is recognized provincially and world-wide as a
wetland area of extraordinary ecological and social importance, with part of the NWA
sheltering the large wetland complex designated as a Ramsarsite
(http://www.ramsar.org/). Located along the Atlantic Flyray, the area is one of the most
important staging grounds on the continent for waterfowl. Hundreds of thousands of
migrating birds pass through Long Point every spring and fall, and more than 300 different
migratory bird specíes visit the peninsula. As a designated NWA, Long Point is protected
                                                  4
  and managed according to the Wildlife Area Regulations under the Canada Wildlife Act.
 The NWA provides habitat to a number of federally and provincially identified SAR. Some
 of the more notable endangered species include: Least Bittern, King Rail, Piping Plover
 and Prothonotary Warbler.
 Staging waterfowl rely on Long Point NWA and Long Point inner bay during spring and
 fall migration. For this reason, larger concentrations of birds would congregate in the area
 at these times. There would be potential to impact migratory birds if the project were to
 occur during these periods. However, if the cable installation occurs outside spring and
 fall migration periods and the cable route remains no closer than the proposed 5 to 10 km
 distance east of the tip of Long Point, ECCC expects that there are unlikely to be direct
 impacts on the migratory birds found within or immediately adjacent to the Long Point
 NWA.
 NWA Protection Recommendations
      3.  ln the circumstance that the cable route or any project activities occur within 5
          kilometres of the NWA, ECCC must be contacted directly and informed. Email:
          ec.faune.ontario-wild life.ontario. ec@canada. ca / phone at 905-336 -4464.
Water Quality
 ECCC provided data in our possession on contaminated sediments in Lake Erie to the
 proponent who then incorporated the information into their water quality model prepared in
 May 2015. The proponent did a follow-up study (Marine Geophysical Survey Report)
 supplementing the NEB application with more recent sediment data. This data was used
to slightly amend the original HVDC undenruater cable route to avoid geo-hazards and
 constraints, such as a gas diapir or glacial deposition.
A jet-plow would be used to bury the HVDC and fibre-optic lines along the Lake Erie
 bed. This is a very common technique for burying undenrvater cables and uses a
 combination of a plow shear and high pressure water jets to cut a trench in the
 lakebed. This process will disturb and re-suspend the lakebed sediments temporarily.
 Results of the water quality modelling for total suspended solids (TSS) show that the peak
TSS increases ranged from up to 2,500 mg/L initially and then rapidly decreased to less
than 100 mg/L in about 30-60 minutes and again down to less than 3 mg/L above
background in one to four hours. The following metals were also considered in the model:
arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, zinc and mercury. The dissolved metal
increases for the eight metals are below Ontario Provincial Water Quality Objectives
(based on the water quality modelling); and within one to four hours, TSS reaches less
than 3 mg/L above background. Due to these factors, ECCC considers it unlikely that the
jet-plow installation component will cause substantial adverse effects on water quality.
Risks to water quality undertaken during the construction phase of the project exist from
the drilling fluids associated with Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD). HDD will be used
on land where the construction of a trench is not feasible. The proponent proposes to drill
under the shoreline and will either drill from land out towards the lake or will place the drill
rig on a platform in the lake and drill in towards the shoreline. ln both instances
containment for the drilling fluid is being proposed and will consist of either curtains or a
                                                 5
  pre-excavated drilling pit in the case of drilling from land to water, or a coffer dam in the
 case of drilling from a platform on the water. HDD also has the potential for inadvertent
  returns, which occur when drilling fluids leak through an unidentified weakness or fissure
 in the soil, potentially leading to the fluid to be released in a nearby waterbody and/ or
 lake.
 ln the event of an inadvertent release of drilling fluid into a nearby waterbody and/ or lake,
 it is unclear how exactly the fluid would be isolated and cleaned up (i.e. what procedure
 and materials would be used) and how successful the recovery of the drilling fluids would
 be in water. Further, it is unclear what the basis is to support the statement made that the
 effect of inadvertent release is expected to be within the range of existing turbidity
 conditions. Because of this uncertainty and because the details of the 'HDD: Contingency
 Plan and Emergency Plan' are to be released at a later date, it is difficult to determine
 whether there is the risk of adverse effects from the inadvertent release of drilling fluids
 from the HDD into surface waters.
 Water Quality Recommendations
      4.  ln addition to the proponent's proposed mitigation measures and proposed actions
          included in the responses to lR No.3, which included water quality monitoring in
          the case of the accidental release of HDD drilling fluid, ECCC also recommends
          that the proponent undertake water quality monitoring of areas of the lake which
          do not appear to have been impacted in order to delineate and define the
          geographical limit of the release as well as verify the effectiveness of the mitigation
          measures used in rêsponse to the spill.
 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement
 Pursuant to Article 6 (c) of the 2012 Canada-U.S. Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement,
 Canada or the U.S. can notify the other country through the Great Lakes Executive
 Committee of planned activities that could lead to a pollution incident or that could have a
significant cumulative impact on the waters of the Great Lakes. The notification of the
 planned activity does not in any way endorse the planned activity or recognize that the
 planned activity will lead to a pollution incident or will have a significant cumulative impact
on the waters of the Great Lakes.
On February 5,2016, Canada notified the U.S., through the Great Lakes Executive
Committee, of applications presently being reviewed by the NEB for the conversion or
construction and operation of four separate projects, including the ITC Lake Erie
Connector project.
Air Quality & Greenhouse Gases (GHGs)
The main sources of air emissions from this project will occur during the construction
phase. This phase involves the construction of a converter station, a terrestrial cable
installation, and an undenvater cable installation. This phase will take approximately two
years to complete. The construction phase will generate fugitive dust, CO2 and particulate
emissions related to activities such as site preparation, grubbing, clearing and excavation.
                                                   6
  Other sources include emissions from on and off-road construction equipment. When
 installing the undenruater cable, the main source of emissions would be from the boat
 engines and depending on the number, size and model(s), there may be co2, Nox, so2
 and PM generated.
 The operation phase of this project entails the use of sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and other
 associated contaminants as an insulating and/ or arc quenching medium in high voltage
 electric equipment. SF6 could potentially be emitted as a result of equipment leak. SF6
 has a substantial impact as a GHG with a globalwarming potential 22,800 times more
 powerfulthan CO2.
 The operation phase of this project also causes NOx emissions to be released from the
 testing of the Emergency Diesel Generator. ECCC does not have guidelines for
 emergency back-up generators' air emissions; however the proponent may wish to
 consider the effects of its project in light of the Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards
 (CAAOS). Standards have been developed for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone,
 and standards for nitrogen dioxide (No2) and sulphur dioxide (so2) are under
 development. The CAAQS are established as objectives under the Canadian
 Environ mental Protection Act.
 Air Quality & GHG Recommendations
     5.    ECCC recommends that the proponent develop an Environmental Management
           Plan and/ or Best Management Plan that includes mitigation measures for fugitive
          dust during the construction phase (given that the duration of construction phase is
           over 2 years). The following guidance document should be consulted: "Best
          Practices for the Reduction of Air Emissions from Construction and Demolition
          Activities" (Cheminfo Services lnc., 2005).
     6.   Due to the proximity of the construction site to receptors (including First Nations
          lands) and the duration of the construction phase, ECCC recommends that the
          proponent develop a monitoring plan for dust and particulate matter to verify the
          accuracy of the predictions related to the environmental effects on air quality, and
          to facilitate the development of adaptive management measures, should there be
          any unanticipated adverse environmental effects. ECCC would be willing to review
          and provide comments on the proponent's best management practices and
          monitoring plan documents.
     7.   ln order to minimize the risks of inadvertent releases of SF6, ECCC recommends
          that the proponent develop best management practices in relation to SF6, such as
          gathering data on usage, routine equipment maintenance and inspection, recovery
          and recycling of SF6 and improving sealing methods of equipment if needed.
    8.    ECCC recommends that the proponent provide an estimation of the direct GHG
          emissions for all phases of the project.
ln Closing
                                                   7

As a coalition of large industrial power customers in Niagara Region, the Industrial Power Users of Niagara
(IPUN) views the ITC Lake Erie Connector project with some concern.
In principle, IPUN does not object to the construction of the ITC Lake Erie Connector project. IPUN generally
encourages interconnectivity between jurisdictions and the establishment of a more interlinked system
suited to meet Ontario’s diverse needs.
However, IPUN recommends that the ITC Lake Erie Connector export only uncontracted Ontario power.
IPUN’s members are concerned that increasing exports of contracted power will result in additional foregone
Global Adjustment payments and greater subsidization of these exports by large hydro ratepayers, many of
whom have experienced significant cost pressures from rate increases in recent years. Niagara heavy
industry cannot afford to continue subsidizing ever-increasing foregone Global Adjustment revenue from
contracted power exported at a loss.
ABOUT IPUN
The Industrial Power Users of Niagara represents a coalition of large electricity-using industrial customers
based in Niagara Region, Ontario. The interest of IPUN is to achieve increased job retention and creation in
the Niagara Region through the proposed Beck Economic Cluster pilot, which leverages the Province of
Ontario’s significant hydroelectricity assets to create proximity-based incentives for industrial power use,

 including offsetting costs such as the Global Adjustment.
IPUN’s members are heavy industrial customers and power users who are directly affected by high electricity
rates, including subsidization of power transferred through Ontario’s interties for export, which is not subject
to the Global Adjustment.
IPUN is cognizant of the significant excess generating capacity enjoyed by the Province of Ontario. The
position of IPUN is that some degree of Ontario’s electricity surplus should be applied towards rate
incentives for heavy power users in proximity to the Niagara-New York intertie.
WHY UNCONTRACTED POWER
By “uncontracted power,” IPUN refers to electricity which is not contracted to the Independent Electricity
System Operator.
As noted in the National Energy Board Election Certificate Application for the ITC Lake Erie Connector project:
“...increasing the amount of intertie capacity will allow energy from surplus baseload generation to be
exported to adjacent markets which enhances overall market and power system efficiency.”
At an open house on July 29, 2014, listed in table 5.2-3 on page 5-11 of the Election Certificate Application, a
commenter asked, “Ontario excess power is presently being sent to others at a loss – How will this change?”
The proponent responded that “How (the Lake Erie Connector) will impact the Ontario market is yet to be
determined.”
In a Frequently Asked Questions document contained in Appendix C-1 of Annex 16 of Agency Consultation
Summary Report 2, found in Volume 3, of the Election Certificate Collection, Lake Erie Power Corp notes that
“None of the costs for the installation of this project will be passed to consumers in Ontario.”
In 2015, the Province of Ontario exported 22,618 gigawatt-hours of electricity, including 10,248 GWh to
Michigan and 8,571 GWh to New York. This is an increase of 18.59% over 2014, when the Province exported
19,073 GWh of electricity. Exports have increased every year since 2011. In January, the Province exported
2,252 GWh; if these trends continue, Ontario will export more electricity in 2016 than in 2015, continuing
the steady increase in exports. (All figures from IESO Imports and Exports By Jurisdiction table.
http://www.ieso.ca/Pages/Media/Imports-and-Exports.aspx)
While it is to the benefit of large hydro ratepayers that the cost of installation will not be passed on to the
consumer, IPUN’s members are concerned that once the project is installed, the market impact of the Lake
Erie Connector is “yet to be determined.” It is critical that the project does not become a net cost for Niagara
industrial power users through the exporting of significant quantities of contracted power.
IPUN acknowledges the benefits of Ontario energy generated largely from non-coal sources, particularly in
U.S. markets dominated by coal-fired electricity generation. However, it is critical that any capacity exported
from Ontario be done so in a manner which is to the benefit of Ontario power users and manufacturers.
The sale of Ontario power to the United States at a loss results in hydro consumers at the local level
effectively subsidizing the transmission of local electricity abroad. This power can then be used in

 jurisdictions such as New York State which offer hydro rate incentives to heavy industry. Presently, exports of
electricity from Ontario are not subject to the Global Adjustment. In 2012, 5.8 TWh of electricity was
exported from Ontario to New York, resulting in the forfeited collection of $280 million in Global Adjustment.
In successive years, exports to New York and Michigan have only increased, resulting in increased amounts of
forfeited Global Adjustment. This forfeited Global Adjustment cost is ultimately passed on to Ontario
ratepayers.
Ontario ratepayers, including heavy industrial power users in Niagara already struggling with high electricity
rates, subsidize discounted hydro exports by covering off forfeited Global Adjustment charges from power
exported through intertie connections, including the ITC Lake Erie Connector. IPUN hopes that this project
will carry only non-contracted power and avoid forfeiting more Global Adjustment costs, thus inflicting more
hardship upon already struggling industrial power users.

                                       “Application”)
       RESPONSE TO INFORMATION REQUEST No. 1 TO MAMTOBA HYDRO
        Manitoba Hydro provides the following response to the National Energy Board’s
Information Request No. 1 to Manitoba Hydro, dated March 24, 2016, a copy of which is
attached to this Response. In each instance in its response below, Manitoba Hydro has included
for the Board’s ease of reference the text of the question that was asked.
 Please provide:
        a) a description of Manitoba Hydro’s involvement in any system or reliability
             studies related to the Project, including:
             a.1) a summary of the information that Manitoba Hydro would provide if
             contacted; and
             a.2) a description of what Manitoba Hydro would consider necessary for an
             impact analysis for the Project to be complete regarding the impacts on
             Manitoba’s electrical system and the Manitoba-Ontario and Manitoba-
             Minnesota ties.
       a. 1)
       Manitoba Hydro was not involved in any system or reliability studies related to the
       Project and was not contacted to provide any information in connection with any system
       or reliability studies related to the Project. if contacted, Manitoba Hydro would be open
       to providing any information that might be relevant and appropriate in order for a party to
       perform a comprehensive study. Manitoba Hydro anticipates this may include
       information such as known commitments for interchange between Manitoba and Ontario,
       phase-shifter transformer modeling information, planned facility additions in Manitoba or
       historic operation of phase-shifters.
       a.2)
       Manitoba Hydro would consider it necessary for any impact analysis for the Project to, at
       minimum, quantify the expected maximum magnitude of phase angle change on the
       Ontario-Manitoba and Ontario-Minnesota phase-shifting transformers as a result of
       adding the Project (for example, 100 MW/degree change). The plot below is an example
       of the impact of adjusting power flows across the East-West ties (Thunder Bay to Wawa)
       in northwest Ontario. A five (5) MW power flow schedule change on this tie results in a
       one (1) degree impact on the Manitoba phase-shifters.

Analysis of the impact of adjusting power flow schedules on the Project from maximum
export to maximum import amounts (i.e. similar to the East-West tie example above) and
analysis of the impact of the loss of the Project when it is carrying maximum export
would, in Manitoba Hydro’s opinion, be two examples of reasonable tests to quantify the
impact of the Project, if any. From the Study Report for the Project’, it appears as though
analysis related to the loss of the Project is what was performed by the Independent
Electricity System Operator (“ESO”) with respect to the other Ontario tie-lines.
Manitoba Hydro would expect that sensitivity to the location of operating reserves to the
Project be considered in any impact analysis conducted. Operating reserves that are
located near the Project will have a lesser impact (measured in MW/degree) on the phase
shift angles of the phase-shifting transformers in Manitoba than operating reserves
located a far distance away from the Project (For example, Thunder Bay could have a
five (5) MV//degree impact).
 (b) a thorough explanation of how the proposed Project can negatively impact
Manitoba’s electrical system, the Ontario-Manitoba and the Ontario-Minnesota ties
and how the negative impact can be mitigated.
Without a comprehensive impact analysis of the Project on the Manitoba electrical
system and the Ontario-Manitoba and Ontario-Minnesota ties, the existence of any
negative impacts is not known. However, Manitoba Hydro is concerned about a number
of potential negative impacts that the addition of the Project, and the resulting potential
increase in ioop flow, could have, including potential impacts on the reliability of the
bulk power system, increased wear and tear on Manitoba Hydro equipment as well as
increased maintenance requirements and a greater demand on Manitoba Hydro resources,
and diminished ability for Manitoba Hydro to export power for sale and/or a potential
necessity for Manitoba Hydro to purchase power for import.
The Ontario-Manitoba 230 kV tie lines, 1(21W and K22W, each are equipped with a 115
kV, 200 MVA phase-shifting transformer and a series connected 115/230 kV voltage
step-up transformer. These facilities were placed in service in 1972. The on-load tap
changers on the phase-shifting transformers provide an on-load phase angle control range
of ±60°. The on-load tap changers are designed so that during operation they switch the
tap setting as required between ± 60° to hold a constant power flow on the Ontario-
Manitoba tie lines, if the power system operating conditions are such that the on-load tap
changer is driven to a limit (+60° or -60°), a manual off-load tap change has to be
arranged by the Manitoba Hydro System Control Centre and personnel dispatched in
order to place the on-load tap changer back within control range, or the power flow on
the ties would not be controlled to the desired scheduled value, causing possible
reliability concerns of transformer overload and inadvertent flow on the Manitoba to US
international power lines. Off-load taps of +120°, +60°, 0°, -60° and -120° are provided
in the step-up transformers. The combination of on-load and off-load taps enables power
flow control over an angle range ± 180°. The power system phase angle observed at
Whiteshell station in Manitoba currently varies over the majority of this ± 180° angle
range. Currently, Manitoba Hydro and the IESO have an off-load tap change
communication procedure to adjust schedules to permit reliable off-load tap change
adjustments. It is not known if that procedure will still be sufficient in light of any
negative impacts that may arise with the addition of the Project. if power flow schedules
in northwest Ontario around the Great Lakes loop cannot be adjusted fast enough by the
ffiSO in order to prevent overloading of the Whiteshell transformers, the Ontario-
Manitoba ties would be manually or automatically tripped. Loss of the Ontario-Manitoba
ties could impact loading on the Ontario-Minnesota tie line and cause this tie to trip. Loss
 shifting tap changer activity observed shortly after the opening of the Ontario market in
May of 2002. The number of on-load tap changes required to control the scheduled
power increased at that time to about 4000 per month; 40 times the required operations
experienced priorto Ontario market startup. As a result of the increased activity, forced
outage occurrences and outage durations of the phase-shifting units have also been
increasing due to the wear and tear on equipment and the requirement for more
maintenance. Manitoba Hydro has concerns that the potential increase in loop flow that
may accompany the Project will increase the need for on-load tap changes on the phase
shifting transformers resulting in earlier than expected wear out of equipment, including
the on-load tap changers.
 The number of required off-load tap changes has also increased significantly since the
opening of the Ontario market and Manitoba Hydro is concerned could potentially
increase further with the addition of the Project. The off-load tap change procedure
currently in place requires that the Ontario-Manitoba power transfer is reduced to 150
lvflV if the power transfer exceeds this level (a maximum system intact transfer of 263
MW is possible). The off load tap change procedure involves one phase-shifting
transformer being de-energized, the off-load tap change being made and the bank then re
energized. if there was a prior outage of one bank, the power flow schedule on the
remaining bank needs to be reduced to zero prior to de-energizing and performing an off-
load phase shift adjustment. This procedure typically requires about 12 minutes but can
be longer. Then the second phase-shifting transformer is de-energized, the tap change is
made and the bank is re-energized. Finally the power transfer is restored. This process is
manual. Manitoba Hydro’s present experience is that this process may have to be
repeated four times per day during certain times of the year, and an average of about 300
times per year. An increase in the required off-load tap changes leads to similar concerns
for Manitoba Hydro as exist for any increase in the on-load tap changes as discussed
above.
In addition, during the time that off-load tap changes are being performed (approximately
 15-30 minutes in duration each time), Manitoba Hydro is required to reduce power flow
schedules. This may result in the curtailment of power exports or the need to increase
power imports, both of which may be economically detrimental to Manitoba Hydro.

 Negative impacts that may be caused by power flow schedule changes on the Project may
be mitigated by adjusting the ramp rate of the power flow schedule adjustment or
coordinating the timing of the schedule adjustment to ensure sufficient on-load phase
shifter capability is available in Manitoba. Negative impacts that may be caused by an
unplanned outage of the Project may be mitigated by reducing the pre-loading on the
Project or possibly adjusting the preferred location of plants providing operating reserves
to ensure sufficient on-load phase shifter capability is available in Manitoba. To the
extent that an impact analysis of the Project is conducted with respect to the Manitoba
electrical system finds that the Project has any negative impacts on the Manitoba
electrical system, then Manitoba Hydro would expect that the party responsible for
operating the Project would work with Manitoba Hydro in developing any necessary
operating procedures to mitigate any such negative impacts.
 c) an explanation of the loop flow phenomenon and how Manitoba Hydro and
   neighboring jurisdictions are part of this phenomenon.
   An interconnection between Manitoba and Ontario was put in place in 1972 for the
   export of 200 MW of firm power to Ontario. For reliability, the interconnection consists
   of two 230 kV lines, 80 miles (129 1cm) long from Whiteshell station in eastern Manitoba
   to Kenora in Western Ontario. As a result of transmission ties between US. utilities and
   Manitoba in the west and U.S. utilities and Ontario in the east a transmission loop around
   the Great Lakes was created when Manitoba and Ontario were interconnected. Power will
   flow over the path of least resistance, and, as a result, it may not flow over the path for
   which it is scheduled by a transmission operator. This difference between actual and
   scheduled flow on a path or interface is called loop flow. Loop flow has historically been
   both common and extremely volatile in the Lake Erie region. 2 Scheduled power flows
   between any two nodes along the loop results in a portion of the schedule flowing on the
   parallel path based on the relative impedances unless special control measures are taken.
   Studies showed early that large unscheduled power flows of at least 100 MW would
   circulate in the Great Lakes loop.3 This ioop flow would be superposed on normal
   scheduled flows and could overload portions of the loop, which would cause a reliability
   concern. Corrective measures needed to be taken in order to address the loop flow.
   Phase-shifting transformers in the Ontario-Manitoba interconnection were selected as the
   most economic solutjon by Manitoba Hydro and Ontario Hydro. The phase-shifting
   transformers allow undesired power flows to be suppressed and facilitate delivery of
   contracted firm power. A picture of the loop in 1973 is shown in the figure below.

 d) an explanation of your comment with supporting evidence if possible about
    “[tjhere is a pre-existing issue, and related concern in the industry, with respect
    to the excessive loop flow on the transmission lines that encircle the Great lakes.”
As discussed in the answers above, and in Manitoba Hydro’s Letter of Comment filed
with respect to the Project4, ioop flow around the Great Lakes has existed since 1972.
Loop flow is currently being managed by operating procedures and by the use of phase
shifting transformers located at strategic locations on the Manitoba-Ontario (ISD 1972),
Minnesota-Ontario (ISD 1992) and Michigan-Ontario (1St) July 2012) interfaces,
 e) an explanation of what impact the proposed Project could have on the loop flow
    phenomenon.
Without an impact study, it is difficult to estimate what, if any, impact the Project could
have on the ioop flow around the Great Lakes. Manitoba Hydro is aware that the impact
of the Project on ioop flow will be highly dependent on the location of generators
providing operating reserves. The location of generation in Ontario that may be used as a
source of operating reserves is unknown. if the generation were located north of Sudbury
or near Thunder Bay, for example, a portion of the power flow schedule will flow
directly towards the Project and a portion will loop around the Great Lakes, which will
impact the phase angle of the various phase shifters along the path, or ‘loop’ including
Manitoba Hydro’s. If there is an unplanned outage of the Project, there will potentially be
a surplus or deficit of generation in the IESO region that is initially controlled via inertia
response of local generation and then by plants providing operating reserves. Manitoba
Hydro is aware of a small amount of regulation reserves (+1-100 MW) provided at
Niagara Falls facility (nearby the Project). However, loss of the Project could result in
loss as great as 1000 IvW/ of generation that will require more remote generation to
provide the required operating reserves.
 1) a thorough explanation of how, at present, the phase-shifting transformers
    mitigate the loop flow phenomenon and what factors or system conditions will
    affect this mitigation strategy.
Please see response in (b) above with respect to the role of the phase-shifting
transformers in mitigating ioop flow. The ability of the phase-shifting transformers to
effectively mitigate loop flow would depend on schedule changes of parties along the
path. The greater the number arid magnitude of the schedule changes, the greater the
stress will be on the phase-shifting transformers.
 g) scenarios, and a thorough explanation of those scenarios, in which excessive ioop
    flow may happen and the impact on the phase-shifting transformers mitigation
    strategy.
The impact of excessive ioop flow on the phase-shifting transformer mitigation strategy
cannot be known without a comprehensive impact analysis of the Project. The
development of various potential scenarios  —  including, for example, the location of
operating reserves as discussed above would, in Manitoba Hydro’s opinion, form part
                                      —
of the scope developed by IESO for such impact analysis.
 h) system conditions and the probability of those conditions in which excessive loop
    flow may happen on the Ontario-Minnesota tie and how that affects the
    reliability of the Ontario-Manitoba tie and the potential for violations of NERC
    Standards, identifying the specific Standards.
Excessive ioop flow on the Ontario-Minnesota tie that would cause the Ontario-
Minnesota tie to trip has the potentiai to impact loading on the Ontario-Manitoba tie,
causing it to subsequently trip. The system conditions that may contribute to such
excessive ioop flow would, in Manitoba Hydro’s opinion, form part of the scope of the
impact analysis of the Project. It is not possible for Manitoba Hydro to predict the
probability of any such system conditions.
The potential violation of any NERC standards would also form part of the impact
analysis of the Project. Manitoba Hydro has identified NERC Transmission Planning
standard, TPL-0014 as one NERC standard that may potentially be violated. TPL-OOl-4
(R2.4.3) requires sensitivity analysis to adjust expected transfers by a sufficient amount
to stress the System within a range of credible conditions as identified in the standard.
The standard requires (Category P7 in Table 1 of TPL-OOl-4) that loss of a project must
not result in cascade tripping. As discussed above, Manitoba Hydro is concerned that the
loss of the Project may result in tripping of the Ontario-Minnesota tie and subsequently
the Ontario-Manitoba tie or vice versa.
 I) a thorough explanation of how more frequent off-load phase shift tap
    adjustments on Manitoba’s phase-shifting transformers negatively affect the
    transformers, Manitoba’s electric system or the Bulk Power System’s reliability.
    Include the potential order of magnitude of those frequent off-load phase shift
    tap adjustments, and theimplications.
Please see the discussion of these issues in (b) above.
 ALL OF WifiCH IS RESPECTFULLY SUBMInED.

        RESPONSE TO INFORMATION REQUEST No. 2 TO MANITOBA HYDRO
        Manitoba Hydro provides the following response to the National Energy Board’s
Information Request No. 2 to Manitoba Hydro, dated May 9, 2016, a copy of which is attached
to this Response. In each instance in its response below, Manitoba Hydro has included for the
Board’s ease of reference the text of the question that was asked.
 Provide:
   a) confirmation of whether IESO’s comments addressed any of Manitoba Hydro’s
      concerns. If so, which concerns were addressed;
      IESO’s comments partly addressed Manitoba Hydro’s three main concerns:
      1) Potential impacts on the Manitoba electrical system may not have been considered in
      the IESO system impact assessment;
      2) The Project may contribute to the existing loop flow problem around the Great Lakes
      and cause more frequent adjustments on equipment in Manitoba; and
      3) The reliability of the Ontario-Manitoba ties could be affected by excessive loop flow
      on the Ontario-Minnesota ties.
      Specifically, the IESO in their comments confirmed that a distribution factor analysis
      was recently conducted in response to Manitoba Hydro’s comments and indicated that
      dispatching generation from southern Ontario to import/export power on the Project
      would have negligible contribution to loop flows on the Ontario-Manitoba or Ontario-
      Minnesota ties. The IESO also confirmed that potential high impact generation
      locations in northwest Ontario are expected to be base loaded and not scheduled to
      import/export power on the Project and therefore would not be expected to contribute to
      excessive changes in the phase shifter angle on the Ontario-Manitoba and Ontario-
      Minnesota ties.
   b) detailed comments on each one of the six (6) IESO statements in reference ii)
       listed in the preamble;
      •    The Project is not an alternating current (AC) transmission line – it is a direct
           current (DC) interconnection. This substantially reduces the contribution of
           the Project to any loop flows on Ontario’s interties with neighbouring
           jurisdictions.
      • Manitoba Hydro respectfully disagrees with this IESO statement. The Project is a DC
           interconnection embedded within an AC network. Schedule changes on the DC
           interconnection have the potential to impact the parallel AC network; in particular,
           schedule changes without a corresponding change in nearby generation resources.
           For example, if the Whiteshell phase shifting transformers were replaced with a
           back-back DC link, schedule changes through this back-back DC link would be
           expected to impact the phase angle on the Ontario-Minnesota tie phase shifter in a
           similar way as the current phase shifting transformers. Manitoba Hydro would not be
           concerned with the Project if the Project and all of Ontario’s interties were DC
           interconnections, however they are not.
 • The Ontario-Manitoba and the Ontario-Minnesota ties are (electrically) very
  distant from the Project.
• Manitoba Hydro agrees with the IESO statement that the Ontario-Manitoba and
  Ontario-Minnesota ties are physically very distant from the Project. However, the
  Project is not sufficiently electrically distant that it can be completely ignored.
• The transmission system connecting northern and southern Ontario consists of
  a few, very long transmission lines, which provide a high resistance to loop
  flows.
• Manitoba Hydro agrees with the IESO statement that the northern/northwestern and
  southern Ontario networks are connected by long transmission lines. However, the
  lines do not provide sufficient resistance to block all loop flow. Loop flow is a
  known concern that has required the installation of phase shifting transformers to
  correct.
• Southern Ontario is expected to be the sink/source for imports/exports on the
  Project.
• Manitoba Hydro thanks the IESO for clarifying the expected source/sink locations
  for imports/exports on the Project.
• The generators in north-western Ontario are, typically, baseload supply
  resources and would likely not be dispatched up/down based on the quantity of
  imports/exports scheduled on the Project.
• Manitoba Hydro thanks the IESO for clarifying the expected use of resources in
  northwest Ontario. However, Manitoba Hydro has concerns about potential impacts
  in the event that the expected use of these resources changes over time and they are
  no longer baseload supply resources.
    •   A distribution factor analysis, completed in response to Manitoba Hydro’s
       comments, confirmed that dispatching generation in southern Ontario to
       import/export power on the Project will have a negligible contribution to loop
       flows on the Manitoba or Minnesota ties.
   •   Manitoba Hydro thanks the IESO for conducting the distribution factor analysis
       which indicated a negligible contribution to loop flows. Manitoba Hydro was not
       consulted in the preparation or performance of this analysis and has not had an
       opportunity to review the study scope or results. Manitoba Hydro would like to
       understand the details of this analysis, including for example, which units in
       southern Ontario were selected and the specific recorded change in angle on the
       phase shifters on the Ontario-Manitoba and Ontario-Minnesota ties. Typically,
       distribution factor analysis quantifies the MW change. If there is sufficient on-load
       phase-shift angle range available on the phase shifters, the MW change will be
       recorded as negligible even though the change in angle can be large, which increases
       the risk of requiring an outage to perform an off-load phase shift adjustment in order
       to prevent the phase shifter from losing control of the angle. Manitoba Hydro
       respectfully recommends that the Board require the IESO to provide Manitoba
       Hydro with the study details and results of their recent distribution factor analysis.
c) detailed comments on Manitoba Hydro’s position on each one of the six (6) IESO
   statements in reference ii);
   Manitoba Hydro provided its position on each of IESO’s statements in b) above.
d) a detailed explanation of how the impact of the Project on excessive loop flow will
   be highly dependent on the location of generators providing operating reserves;
   Operating reserves are the generation capacity available to meet demand in case of
   supply disruptions. For example, if Ontario was importing 1000 MW on the Project and
   the Project tripped, operating reserves would be called upon to ensure demand in
   Ontario continued to be supplied. The general principle is that the closer the dispatched
   generation is to the Project, the lesser the impact on the phase shifters on the Ontario-
   Manitoba and Ontario-Minnesota ties. Manitoba Hydro has not conducted any detailed
   analysis of generation outside of northwest Ontario. Thunder Bay generation, for
   example, has a 5 MW per degree impact on the Ontario-Manitoba phase shifter
   transformers. It would be reasonable to expect that larger changes in output from
   generation located in southern Ontario near the Project would be necessary in order to
   make a single degree impact on the phase shifters on the Ontario-Manitoba ties.
 e) a detailed explanation on the significance of the location for generators providing
   operating reserves;
   As described in the response to d) above, if the location of operating reserves is outside
   of southern Ontario, there is a greater possibility of impact on phase shifters.
f) detailed comments on the relevance of IESO’s statement: “the Ontario-Manitoba
   and the Ontario-Minnesota ties are (electrically) very distant from the Project” to
   Manitoba Hydro’s statement: “the impact of the Project on loop flow will be
   highly dependent on the location of generators providing operating reserves”;
   Manitoba Hydro provided its comments on this IESO statement in b) above.
g) a discussion of what factors or conditions, besides the location of generators
   providing operating reserves, will make the Project have a lesser impact on
   excessive loop flow and ultimately on the phase shift angles of the phase-shifting
   transformers;
   The locations of generators that will be scheduled to import/export power on the Project
   or provide operating reserves in case of loss of the Project will be the primary factors
   that impact phase shift angles on the Ontario-Manitoba and Ontario-Minnesota ties.
   Another factor could be the ramp rate of schedules on the Project (i.e. MW/min).
h) a list of technical factors, significant to the Project, that reduce the power flow
   along a transmission line;
   The power flow on a particular networked AC transmission line can be adjusted by
   adjusting the generator dispatch in the local area, for example. The location of the
   generators participating in the power flow dispatch on the Project is the main technical
   factor significant to the Project in Manitoba Hydro’s opinion.
i) detailed comments on how the Project, if fully operational, could mitigate any
   possible impacts on excessive loop flow;
   It is difficult for Manitoba Hydro to contemplate all possible situations of excessive
   loop flow and associated mitigation. The IESO would be in the best position, given
   they are the Reliability Coordinator and have a broad area view, to be able to control
   the location of generator dispatch and generator adjustment schedules on the Project to
   minimize possible impacts on excessive loop flow. In the Manitoba Hydro Response to
   Information Request No. 1 dated April 9, 2016 (Document A76295-1), Manitoba
   Hydro provided some suggestions which, in Manitoba Hydro’s view, may mitigate
    negative impacts that could be caused by excessive loop flow. Suggestions included:
   adjusting the ramp rate of the power flow schedule adjustment on the Project;
   coordinating the timing of the schedule adjustment on the Project to ensure sufficient
   on-load phase shifter capability on the Ontario-Manitoba and Ontario-Minnesota ties;
   and mitigating negative impacts that may be caused by an unplanned outage of the
   Project by reducing the pre-loading on the Project or possibly adjusting the preferred
   location of the operating reserves generation.
j) a recommendation as to how Manitoba Hydro could work with IESO on
   mitigation strategies to address potential impacts from the Project;
   Manitoba Hydro would work with IESO on any necessary or desirable mitigation
   strategies to address potential impacts from the Project, including developing mutually
   agreeable operating procedures. Manitoba Hydro would expect IESO to be obligated to
   revisit and coordinate with Manitoba Hydro on any mitigation strategies that were
   developed on the basis of certain assumptions or conditions, in the event those
   assumptions or conditions should change. For example, the IESO indicated that
   generators in north-western Ontario are not likely to be dispatched up/down based on the
   quantity of imports/exports on the Project. In the event that the expected use of these
   resources changes, and an adverse impact to Manitoba results, or may result, new or
   amended mutually agreeable mitigation strategies may be necessary.
k) a detailed explanation of the information Manitoba Hydro would expect from a
   detailed study; and
   As discussed in Manitoba Hydro’s Response to Information Request No. 1 dated April
   9, 2016 (Document A76295-1), Manitoba Hydro would expect a detailed study to
   quantify the expected maximum magnitude of phase angle change on the Ontario-
   Manitoba and Ontario-Minnesota phase shifting transformers. Analysis of the impact
   of adjusting power flow schedules on the Project from maximum export to maximum
   import amounts, and analysis of the loss of the Project when carrying maximum export
   or import, would be examples of analysis that would be useful to Manitoba Hydro.
   Manitoba Hydro would also expect sensitivities to the location of operating reserves to
   the Project to be included in the analysis.
l) a list of parties that Manitoba Hydro views as capable of conducting a detailed
   study.
   There are no third parties which Manitoba Hydro would specifically recommend be
   retained for the performance of a detailed study.
 ALL OF WHICH IS RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED.

        2.1 Project Implications on the Bulk Power System in Neighbouring Jurisdictions
     Reference:            i) Manitoba Hydro, Response to Information Request (IR) No.1, (PDF
                               pages 1-20 of 20), A76295-1

                               (PDF pages 1-3 of 3), A76299-2
     Preamble:        In reference i) Manitoba Hydro stated that:
                           •   Manitoba Hydro would expect that sensitivity to the location of operating
                               reserves to the Project be considered in any impact analysis conducted.
                               Operating reserves that are located near the Project will have a lesser
                               impact (measured in megawatt (MW)/degree) on the phase shift angles of
                               the phase-shifting transformers in Manitoba than operating reserves
                               located a far distance away from the Project (For example, Thunder Bay
                               could have a five (5) MW/degree impact).
                           •   Manitoba Hydro is aware that the impact of the Project on loop flow will
                               be highly dependent on the location of generators providing operating
                               reserves.
                      In reference ii) the IESO stated that:
                           •   The Project is not an alternating current (AC) transmission line – it is a
                               direct current (DC) interconnection. This substantially reduces the
                               contribution of the Project to any loop flows on Ontario’s interties with
                               neighbouring jurisdictions.
                           •   The Ontario-Manitoba and the Ontario-Minnesota ties are (electrically)
                               very distant from the Project.
                           •   The transmission system connecting northern and southern Ontario
                               consists of a few, very long transmission lines, which provide a high
                               resistance to loop flows.
                                                                           National Energy Board
                                                Information Request No. 2 to Manitoba Hydro
             •   Southern Ontario is expected to be the sink/source for imports/exports on
                 the Project.
             •   The generators in north-western Ontario are, typically, baseload supply
                 resources and would likely not be dispatched up/down based on the
                 quantity of imports/exports scheduled on the Project.
             •   A distribution factor analysis, completed in response to Manitoba
                 Hydro’s comments, confirmed that dispatching generation in southern
                 Ontario to import/export power on the Project will have a negligible
                 contribution to loop flows on the Manitoba or Minnesota ties.
Request: Provide:
             a) confirmation of whether IESO’s comments addressed any of Manitoba
                 Hydro’s concerns. If so, which concerns were addressed;
             b) detailed comments on each one of the six (6) IESO statements in
                 reference ii) listed in the preamble;
             c) detailed comments on Manitoba Hydro’s position on each one of the six
                 (6) IESO statements in reference ii);
             d) a detailed explanation of how the impact of the Project on excessive loop
                 flow will be highly dependent on the location of generators providing
                 operating reserves;
             e) a detailed explanation on the significance of the location for generators
                 providing operating reserves;
             f) detailed comments on the relevance of IESO’s statement: “the Ontario-
                 Manitoba and the Ontario-Minnesota ties are (electrically) very distant
                 from the Project” to Manitoba Hydro’s statement: “the impact of the
                 Project on loop flow will be highly dependent on the location of
                 generators providing operating reserves”;
             g) a discussion of what factors or conditions, besides the location of
                 generators providing operating reserves, will make the Project have a
                 lesser impact on excessive loop flow and ultimately on the phase shift
                 angles of the phase-shifting transformers;
             h) a list of technical factors, significant to the Project, that reduce the power
                 flow along a transmission line;
             i) detailed comments on how the Project, if fully operational, could mitigate
                 any possible impacts on excessive loop flow;
             j) a recommendation as to how Manitoba Hydro could work with IESO on
                 mitigation strategies to address potential impacts from the Project;
                                         4
