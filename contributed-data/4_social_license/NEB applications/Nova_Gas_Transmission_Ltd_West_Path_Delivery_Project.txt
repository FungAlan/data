 The Nature Conservancy of Canada (NCC) has an interest in land which Nova Gas Transmission Ltd. proposes
to take for the Burton Creek compressor station addition (the “affected land”). Specifically, NCC is the holder
or grantee of a Conservation Easement (“CE”) with Registration Number 131 328 383 on title to the affected
land described as part of NW 06-12-01 W5M (Land Title Certificate Number 941 283 192 +1). The grantor of
the CE and the registered owner of the affected land is the Waldron Grazing Co-operative Limited.
The Conservation Easement or “CE” was registered on December 21, 2013 as an interest in the affected land
under the authority of the Alberta Land Stewardship Act. Consistent with that legislation the CE is granted for
purposes including the preservation, conservation or enhancement of the environment and natural values.
To accomplish its objectives the CE prohibits the construction of new buildings or structures ( including
compressor stations ) on the affected land. In accordance with the authorizing legislation the CE is an interest
in land that will run with the land and bind future owners.
In addition, the interest of NCC in the affected land is supported and enabled by the federal government
“ecogift” program for gifts of ecologically sensitive lands and interests in land, such as the Conservation
Easement. The affected land and other lands owned by the Waldron Grazing Co-operative Limited were
qualified as ecologically sensitive lands under the Canada Income Tax Act for purposes of the ecogift
program. Under section 207.31 of the Income Tax Act NCC could be liable for the payment of a tax on the
value of the land if there is a change in use of the land or a disposition of the CE without the written
authorization of the Minister of Environment and Climate Change Canada.
In these circumstances we request that NCC be allowed as a commenter participant where:
- NCC holds a legal interest in the affected land and would be directly affected by the Project as proposed;
- NCC has unique information and expertise respecting the CE, the ecogifts program and related matters;
In addition NCC is connected with or has an interest in the issues numbered and identified by NEB as follows:
- 4. Environmental effects of the Project, including effects upon protected areas, human use and occupancy;
- 5. potential impact of Project on landowners and land users
      ( NCC uses the land for government authorized conservation purposes);
- 7. the appropriateness of the route and land requirements;
- 11. terms and conditions to be attached to any Project approval.

 As land owners who have held this property in the family for 30 years we object to the proposed pipeline
route which will practically dissect our property.
The Company’s planned route runs directly through our property and will eliminate our ability to successfully
subdivide and develop the land as we have planned. The setbacks and safety zones along the pipeline route
mean that the land will be unusable for development.
We are protesting the proposed route.
If, however, the Company gains approval to go ahead with this route then we protest in the strongest
possible way their unacceptable strategy to negotiate compensation while proceeding with the project work.
The Town of Cochrane has plans to develop the area where our property is located (“Area C” in the Town of
Cochrane Growth Management Plan).
Developing this land has always been part of our family investment strategy. This is a lifelong family plan and
a pipeline crossing our property will be a life changing event that will destroy our plan to develop the land,
with a resulting huge negative impact to our retirement and financial security.
As further corroborated in writing to us by the Town of Cochrane Senior Development Manager:
"Your statements/assumptions are correct, the Town would look for future development to meet these
densities moving forward, including Area C. Therefore, in conclusion, the Town DOES anticipate development
in your area in the future once an Area Structure Plan and Neighbourhood Plan have been prepared."
Drew Hyndman, Senior Manager, Development Services.
We are asking for the Company to reconsider the alternate route for the pipeline – this route minimises our
financial loss (although does not eliminate it).
Failing this, we are asking that fair compensation for our loss be negotiated BEFORE the project continues.
"The highest value of alternative land use"
Our water well is approximately 300' feet deep with very little production. The pipeline will be installed
approximately 90+/-m away from our well and anywhere from 35m - 60m deep. Our MAJOR concern is
water contamination or disruption of our VERY limited water supply.
A 42' pipe being forced through bed rock meters from our water supply and the possibility of disrupting
the aquifer is far too much of a risk! therewere to be a leak how would we know and more importantly how
would we know if our water supply is contaminated.
These reasons are only a few that make us believe that this route would be too dangerous a risk to our
heath and FAR too many possibilities of contamination of ground water and supply.
I also understand that during construction LOSS OF CIRCULATION is possible. This would be detrimental
to our LIMITED ground water supply and our local environment.
With this new information that has come to light we are submitting our DISAPROVEL and STRONLY
oppose the current route.

 7.     The appropriateness of the general route and land requirements for the proposed Project, including:
           • The process and criteria for route selection, such as considerations of construction and operating
                safety, environmental impacts, and socio-economic impacts; and
           • Requirements for right-of-way and temporary workspace.
Route A:
The proposed Trans Canada Route A is smart utilization of established pipeline corridors. The expansion can
occur within the existing corridor with minimal impact to the community and better land utilization for future
generations. The current right-of-way has three pipelines. Two are operating and one pipeline is abandoned
through Cochrane. Route A is the most favorable right-of-way as it is already established. The expansion can
occur within the existing corridor without establishing new routes that impact the community and create
duplication. This is also more favorable for setbacks as the pipeline corridor has been established for many
years. The route has been operated safely and profitably with minimum danger to the adjacent residences.
The real estate market impact has been established and this expansion will probably not influence changes. A
new line in the current right of way may not impact or reduce an adjacent landowner's value. The right-of-
way will not sterilize more land.
Route B:
The Trans Canada Pipeline Route B is apposed due to crossing Section 8-26-4W5 parallel to the Inter Pipeline
(IPL) water pipeline. Route B would have a devastating impact on McKendrick Ranches current operation and
sterilization of large tracks of land that will limit future development. The IPL line was never meant to be a
common carrier. The company provided agreements stating that the water line was not to be considered a
common carrier line or suitable for other oil or gas pipeline corridors. The only intended purpose was to
supply water to the now Inter Pipeline Cochrane plant site. The company agreed to move the water pipeline
at their cost if the line hampered the development of the property. Trans Canada was not prepared to pay for
the moving of a route B pipeline similar to the existing agreements. Previously, the ERCB hearing rejected
this route for Koch Pipelines based on this and other reasons.
Background:
Our family has owned Section 8-26-4W5 for over 100 years. Our ranch is over 140 years representing
generations of concern and sustainable business operations.
The McNabb and McKendrick Family have been involved for over 60 years with about 20 different companies
on planning of pipelines, well sites, pump sites, power lines, roads, structures and other facility planning for
several industries across the David H McDougall, GA McKendrick Ranches Ltd and now McKendrick Ranches
Ltd properties. Ann has worked in the Oil and Gas industry on many relevant projects. The family has been at
several hearings with the ERCB as expert witnesses and interested parties. There has been a long established
history of making a difference and establishing smart, sustainable routing and designs.

                residents, land and waterway users and municipalities regarding potential effects of the Project;
           • the appropriateness of the land acquisition process for the Project.
7.     The appropriateness of the general route and land requirements for the proposed Project, including:
           • The process and criteria for route selection, such as considerations of construction and operating
                safety, environmental impacts, and socio-economic impacts; and
           • Requirements for right-of-way and temporary workspace.
The proposed route will essentially sterilize the lower half of our acreage for any future development or
subdivision. NGTL's setback from the pipeline is minimal as the line is sweet however nobody will be in a rush
to build on or close to a 42 " pipeline let alone issue a building or subdivision permit. The reasoning given was
it made the best use of existing utility right-of-ways. The company had an alternate "Route B" which ran west
of town and did not impact any residences or potential subdivision. If in fact using existing utility corridors is
the main driver in the decision tree then why cannot the existing pipeline right-of-way along the west of the
town's edge be shared? What makes one right-of-way preferable over another other than cost?
