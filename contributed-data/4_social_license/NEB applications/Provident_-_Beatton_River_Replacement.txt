Ruel Rantos just called the office to confirm that he got the letter from us. He also said that at the
moment he hasn't been given any instructions as to how to reply and doesn't know exactly what
to do with it just yet.
He's sending me a confirmation e-mail.

Dear Sir:
Re: Your letter dated Nov. 22, 2010 that was hand delivered to Colleen Hill on Nov. 24,
2010.
Pipeline Compensation Sheet
     1) The sheet I received on Aug.10 was blank so this is the first time I have seen
         numbers and dollar amounts. Perhaps I didn’t get all the handouts at the meeting.
     2) Since your employees have been on the ROW several times the option $ 500
         would not be included in the total as stated on option line at the top of the page.
     3) I have not had bales on any of the affected fields for years so am not sure why
         this is included in the calculation under crop loss. Bales imply hay is being
         produced which is not the case, which will also eliminate the re-seeding cost.
     4) Since I have not been informed how the land disturbance will be dealt with I
         cannot agree to your amounts for TWS or N & D.
     5) I can guarantee that a lot more than the $1972.42 incentive will be spent if
         problem weeds are introduced to our land. That dollar amount will not fill the
         sprayer tank once and lasts less than one hour of spraying time in the field.
     6) There has not been any amount designated for time spent dealing with your
         employees and contractors. The soils people have already been out in the 2010
         crop to take samples.
     7) There isn’t any mention of the buffer zones that now comes with an NEB line.
         Rights are taken from the landowner and transferred to Provident and the NEB. I
         place a value on these rights that are taken from our farm.
 As a point of interest our farm produces Pedigreed Seed Crops as well as Forage Seed
Crops. Does Provident Energy have any idea what this means and the affect their project
may have in increasing our cost of business? The Scentless Chamomile that is out of
control on Provident’s ROW two properties away from us could potentially limit our
cropping options. We hand pick this weed where we find it on our farm because there are
very few chemicals that control it and they are expensive. As well it is a Primary Noxious
Weed under the BC Weed Control Act.
Exhibit A Conditions:
      1) Contacting land-owner. What is the purpose when employees / contractors do as
         they please. Two of your contractors have four–wheeled across our fields long
         distances from the ROW for no obvious reason. Is Provident prepared to pay for
         this type of trespass or is it considered OK under the easement agreements?
      2) Weed control. Yes all equipment should be cleaned, but in view of A-1 (above)
         our risk is substantial. Weeds are not mentioned in the easement agreements so
         are we stuck with whatever Provident leaves behind or will they accept
         responsibility for weed issues for the life of the agreements? I brought this
         subject up at the August meeting and have not had a response from Provident.
      3) Pipeline ROW left ready for seeding. I would be more interested in the ROW
         being left with the same productive ability as Provident finds it at present, as our
         experience in this area of limited topsoil is that it takes many years for disturbed
         soil to get back to normal. Has Provident contacted soil people with knowledge
         about what happens to disturbed soil?
      4) It is stated in your letter that you are prepared to use the NEB Arbitration
         process to settle issues. If this happens I want Provident’s committment that
         compensation for all Gordon Hill’s and family’s time and legal costs will be
         paid as it is a very time consuming process.
      5) Abandoning the old pipe. How does Provident propose to not leave the
         landowner responsible for the pipe in the future and any costs associated with
         this process?
      The three 1961 easement agreements I have are with Trans-Prairie Pipelines, Ltd.
The previous landowners are all deceased. When these landowners signed in 1961 four
wheelers did not exist, noxious weeds were not much of an issue, the market place did
not demand as perfect a product as today and the NEB was not part of the agreement.
Your letter states Provident is going to enforce these agreements that do not take into
account the changes that have taken place over forty- nine years. We find this
unacceptable.
         We appreciate your attention to these matters and your anticipated reply should be
directed to Dave Core at CAEPLA.
        Sincerely,
        Gordon Hill

Provident Energy Ltd. ("Provident") is writing to you, Mr. David Core, as representative of
CAEPLA as per the letter from Mr. Gordon Hill dated December 2, 2010.
I would like to say that our communication priority in the August meeting in Cecil Lake
Community Hall was to provide all Landowners a good comprehensive overview of the Pipeline
Replacement Project. The compensation discussion was only one of the many topics we
covered. The blank compensation sheet we presented simply lists the criteria being considered
to compensate the Landowners for a more detailed proposal at a later date.
The Offer of Compensation we presented in our November 22, 2010 letter is our best estimate
of what we believe to be fair compensation for the area. Our Land Agent in Roy Northern would
be more than happy to discuss with you how we arrive at our offered compensation amount for
our activities in the land of Mr. Gordon Hill.
While Provident understands that Mr.Gordon Hill has Chosen to have the North Peace
Landowner Committee ("NPLC")'to be his representative to this Pipeline Replacement Project,
Provident is simply acting within its rights to access the Easement and Temporary workspace
for the purpose of replacing an old pipeline for a new pipeline for a safer longer term operations
Provident ensures that our Capital and Operations activities meets if not exceeds the regulatory
requirement for our Project whether it is within Provincial or Federal jurisdiction.
Should you have any further questions about the foregoing, please do not hesitate to contact
myself at 403 781-534, my e-mail rsantos@grovidentenergy.com or Mr. Brian Dunn at 250 261-

Dear Mr. Haughey and Mr. Santos,
RE: The Proposed Beatton River Replacement Project
As Chair and CEO of the Canadian Association of Energy and Pipeline Landowner Associations (CAEPLA), I
have been directed to inform you that 19 landowners affected by the proposed Beatton River
Replacement Project have formed a committee called the North Peace Landowner Committee (NPLC).
The NPLC is a committee of associate members of the Canadian Association of Energy and Pipeline
Landowner Associations that are directly impacted by Provident Energy Pipeline Inc’s proposed Beaton
River Pipeline Replacement Project.
 The aforementioned landowners have legally authorized and directed NPLC/CAEPLA to act on their
behalf in all discussions, negotiations and correspondence with respect to the proposed Beaton River
Pipeline Replacement Project application, in any related regulatory process or proceedings and
landowner consideration, including compensation. Please forward all correspondence to my attention at
the CAEPLA administration address below
The NPLC landowners have been provided with only very limited information to date with respect to this
project. These landowners are very concerned about this pipeline replacement proposal and the
effects the abandoned pipeline and the replacement pipeline will have on their families, lands and
businesses. We understand that you are committed to responsible and sustainable development and
therefore actively want to address the legitimate concerns these landowners have. Obviously, your
company shares the values that agricultural and other landowners have for their land.
 Landowners understand that sustainability also includes the inherent responsibility to stewardship of
the land for future generations and the understanding that they must act to address those
responsibilities when others want to impose projects on their lands. The legitimate issues and
challenges your project creates for these landowners, particularly in regard to stewardship
responsibilities, will require serious consultation and negotiation.
Upon receipt of your advice that Provident will be responsible for all reasonable legal, consultant and
negotiating committee costs incurred with respect to such negotiations, we will be pleased to discuss

 with you mutually convenient meeting arrangements. Since NPLC has only limited financial resources,
NPLC will require payment of such costs in an agreed budget amount in advance of negotiations.
We will be forwarding to you the authorizations and directions from each landowner member along
with a list of issues for which we will be seeking resolution.
Sincerely,

Dear Ms. Erickson,
Re: Provident Energy Pipeline Inc’s (Provident Energy) proposed Beatton River Pipeline Replacement
Project.
As Chair and CEO of the Canadian Association of Energy and Pipeline Landowner Associations (CAEPLA), I
have been directed to inform you that 22 landowners affected by the proposed Beatton River Replacement
Project have formed a committee called the North Peace Landowner Committee (NPLC). The NPLC is a
committee of associate members of the Canadian Association of Energy and Pipeline Landowner Associations
that are directly affected by Provident Energy Pipeline Inc’s proposed Beaton River Pipeline Replacement
Project.
This letter is to notify the National Energy Board (NEB) that the aforementioned landowners have many
legitimate concerns with this project for which they are seeking resolution. You will find attached copies of a
number of letters and emails showing ongoing correspondence with Provident Energy concerning this
project. In each case CAEPLA has received acknowledgement that Provident received the correspondence,
but no response was forwarded. Two of these letters, one dated September 29th and the other November
12th, 2010, were copied to the National Energy Board.
In the Provident Energy handout information for the project, dated August 2010, it stated that the project
would need NEB regulatory approval. It did not describe the process and did not state when the application
would be made. Landowners began to work together in August and it was September when they finalized
their committee and notified Provident.
NPLC/CAEPLA has been waiting to see a hearing order so we could review the application to more fully
understand the project. We did not realize that there would not be one. We also did not realize that the
application had been made or that there was an NEB process occurring. Last week Provident called an urgent
meeting of landowners requesting them to sign a paper directing the NEB to expedite the licensing of the
project. In response, on December 19, 2010, I contacted the Board to inquire about the process to be
expedited. In response we were notified to contact Margaret Barber for more information.
Obviously, the NEB was not made aware of NPLC/CAEPLA concerns and landowners were not made aware of
the process in place. We are requesting that this process be delayed. NPLC/CAEPLA landowners are trying to
understand the extent of the project and have the company understand the seriousness of our concerns. It
appears that the NEB considers this a simple decommissioning project. Landowners do not have the same
view.

 The attached correspondence makes it clear that Provident Energy has been made aware of NPLC/CAEPLA
concerns. Some of those concerns are as follows.
NPLC Provident Energy Pipeline Replacement Project Issues of Landowners:
        Negotiating Costs - NPLC requires that Provident Energy deposits funds sufficient to cover all
        costs associated with negotiating an acceptable agreement in resolving issues involved in this
        Provident Energy Pipeline Replacement Project.
        The amount of compensation for Pipeline Corridor ROW - Landowners require renegotiations
        of original pipeline corridor Right of Entry fees as well as an effective beginning contractual date,
        with established renegotiation dates to reflect the change in monetary purchasing value. A
        contractual start date for the pipeline ROW compensation to Landowners, and ROW
        compensation review periods with set dates, based on the purchasing value of the Canadian
        dollar at each review anniversary period, compared to the dollar value as of January 1, 2011.
        Recovery of the decommissioned pipeline owned by Provident Energy - Landowners require
        that Provident Energy remove and recover all of the pipe which is to be replaced, out of the
        ground to reduce liability to landowners, and is in keeping with reducing soil contaminates to
        the landowners.
        Future abandonment of the current replacement pipeline project. In view of current minimum
        regulatory requirements with respect to future pipeline abandonment, and the issue of
        jurisdiction and abandoned pipelines, landowners require that provision for abandonment be
        included in project planning and that landowners have the option upon future abandonment to
        require removal of both future and existing lines. Provident Energy should also establish a fund
        to secure the costs of reclamation and other costs and damages associated with abandonment.
        Depth of Cover – Landowners are concerned that depth of cover over both existing and new
        pipelines be sufficient to accommodate modern agricultural cultivation practices and farm
        machinery, and to reduce potential for third party impact and damages which may result there
        from. Provident Energy’s proposed pipelines should be installed at a depth of cover no less than
        five (5) feet.
        Risk Assessment/Pipe Thickness – Landowners need to be satisfied that appropriate risk
        assessment has been completed, identifying and quantifying potential risks and outcomes so
        that appropriate design specifications are incorporated into the planning process to minimize
        risks to landowners, their families, and communities. This issue is of particular concern because
        of the product to be transported through the proposed pipeline.
        Indemnity – Landowners require provision in their easement agreements that Provident Energy
        indemnify them with respect to any claims arising from Provident Energy’s pipeline operations.
 Landowners also want Provident Energy to provide assurances with respect to adequate liability
insurance coverage covering construction and operation of the pipeline, both for Provident
Energy and its contractors, as well as detailed analytical information on the products being
transported in the pipelines through their properties.
Future Use – Landowners require that these pipelines be constructed to minimise interference
with the future use of their lands, and that Provident Energy be responsible for any costs
incurred in relation to changes in use attributable to the existence of this pipeline corridor.
Soil Management – There is proven soil and drainage disturbance and damage during
construction of pipelines that result in continuing production losses. Landowners are very
concerned that appropriate construction methodology and restoration measures are
implemented to minimize damage to virgin and vulnerable soils. Landowners require an
effective dispute resolution system for the resolution of construction issues. To that effect, they
require that an independent construction monitor be appointed to ensure that Provident
Energy’s commitments to landowners are fulfilled, and to assist a joint committee consisting of
Provident Energy and landowner representatives to resolve issues which arise during
construction.
Protection against Soil Contamination – Landowners require Provident Energy to ensure that
their lands will be protected against the importation of and contamination by disease, weeds,
and other contaminants as a result of the construction and operation of the pipelines. Provident
Energy must develop and employ an effective prevention and protection protocol where the
potential for contamination exists. The effective prevention and protection protocol will
include the Battleford Trail Group ‘Club Root Protocol’, and as such there will be no entry
granted to any contractor or surveyor on a NPLC member’s land until such time as CAEPA
directs.
Water source Protection – Provident Energy must ensure that groundwater sources for human
and livestock consumption and for irrigation are protected during construction and operation of
the pipeline. Where it is possible that such sources may be affected by construction or
operational practices, quantitative and qualitative testing must be performed before and after,
and where the water source is affected, Provident Energy must establish an alternative source
to the satisfaction of the landowner.
Wet Soil Shutdown – Should Provident Energy be intending to work in wet soil conditions,
landowners require that they be consulted with respect to the nature and extent of the work to
be undertaken (with access to independent consultant advice), and that project planning include
provision for all technically feasible construction methods to minimize soil damage. In addition,
landowners require that proposed compensation include provision for increased losses which
landowners will inevitably suffer if work proceeds in wet soil conditions.
 Construction Access – Landowners require that the length of open trench be restricted during
construction and that reasonable provision be made to limit interference with their access to
agricultural lands.
Land Rights Compensation – With the creation of this utility corridor, landowners require that
compensation paid in advance of construction reflect not only the agricultural market value of
this land, but the intensification of its use and an annual payment renegotiated every five (5)
years to address the diminishment of the value of remaining lands both for more intensive
agricultural use and other development. Landowners also require a ditching fee, based on a
negotiated rate charge per meter.
Wood Lot Restoration and Compensation – Landowners are similarly concerned that
compensation paid in advance of construction, include provision for trees which will be
damaged or destroyed reflecting aesthetic and commercial value, and that satisfactory provision
be made for replacement and maintenance of equivalent trees.
Site Specific Construction Issues – Provident Energy must arrange with individual landowners in
advance of construction, to the extent it is possible to do so, to address site specific works,
damages, and compensation issues. Where these issues cannot be dealt with adequately in
advance, Provident Energy must ensure that landowners can have these issues addressed during
the construction process.
Disturbance Damages – Landowners are concerned that the utility corridor to be created by
Provident Energy’s proposed pipeline construction will result in increased, ongoing interference
in the conduct of their agricultural operations, and diminishment in the quality of life for them
and their families (including anxiety, stress, inconvenience, and the cost for landowners during
construction and operation of the pipeline). They require that compensation paid in advance of
construction, and as an annual payment recognize these impacts, both during construction and
forever thereafter during the operation of the pipeline.
Crop Loss Compensation – Landowners require compensation in advance of construction which
recognizes the production losses they will suffer on both easement and temporary use lands
during construction, and an annual payment for all future losses. This compensation must
include provision renegotiation to address the issues of anticipated future increases in prices
and productivity.

Future Loss – Following construction and during the operation of the pipeline, landowners
require annual compensation, subject to periodic review, to address future land value,
disturbance, and production impacts.
          Maintenance & Repairs – Landowners are concerned about maintenance and repair operations
         conducted by Provident Energy on their lands with respect to the pipeline as it ages, and require
         that an ancillary agreement be developed to cover such operations which includes provision for
         scheduling of such activities; construction methods and restoration measures to be
         implemented with respect to access, temporary use and dig site lands; minimum land rights,
         disturbance and crop loss compensation to be paid in advance; and, provision for increased
         compensation where these operations are carried out in wet soil conditions.
In conclusion, the decision on this project should be delayed. If we need to make a motion to that effect
we will. Provident Energy has chosen not to deal with NPLC/CAEPLA legitimate concerns and the need to
address their stewardship responsibilities. NPLC/CAEPLA landowners and other landowners were not
aware of this unique regulatory process. Provident is trying to expedite the process without addressing
any of these issues.
We attach the following correspondence to show that Provident Energy was well aware of NPLC/CAEPLA
landowner concerns.

Dear Mr. Santos,
RE: The Proposed Beatton River Replacement Project
As Chair and CEO of the Canadian Association of Energy and Pipeline Landowner Associations (CAEPLA), I
have been directed to inform you that 22 landowners affected by the proposed Beatton River Replacement
Project have formed a committee called the North Peace Landowner Committee (NPLC). The NPLC is a
committee of associate members of the Canadian Association of Energy and Pipeline Landowner Associations
that are directly affected by Provident Energy Pipeline Inc’s proposed Beaton River Pipeline Replacement
Project.
As mentioned in my previous letter (attached), dated September 29, 2010, landowners affected by the
proposed Beatton River Replacement Project have authorized NPLC/CAEPLA to act on their behalf in all
discussions, negotiations and correspondence with respect to this project. We understand that you did
receive the aforementioned letter but your company has chosen to not respond at this time.
I am forwarding to you, via email, all signed Authorization and Direction forms and ask that land agents
working on behalf of Provident Energy refrain from contacting landowners. We will continue to forward any
new Authorizations and Directions as they are received. Please forward all correspondence to my attention at
the CAEPLA address below and copy all emails to my secretary, Ms. Deborah McVicar at
Deborah@caepla.org. Please note that NPLC landowners do not want to be contacted (harassed) by land
agents when it has been made perfectly clear that they have authorized NPLC/CAEPLA to act on their behalf
at this time. In light of the fact that landowners have authorized NPLC/CAEPLA to act on their behalf, the
landowners will be advised to take legal action, if land agents continue to contact them.
Please also forward a copy of any and all proposed agreements that Provident Energy is proposing at this
time. We look forward to your earliest response.
Sincerely,
David R. Core

Dear Ms. Erickson,
RE: Provident Energy’s Beatton River Replacement Project
Please find attached a copy of a letter from Provident Energy to a landowner that was copied to CAEPLA.
The North Peace Landowner Committee (NPLC)/CAEPLA would like the National Energy Board (NEB) to
advise the validity of the claims made by the company under NEB regulations.
NPLC/CAEPLA requests that the NEB clearly explain to landowners the approval process for this project,
how landowners can address their legitimate issues and if the split application made by the company is
justifiable. As you can see by the attached letter, it appears the company is using strong armed tactics to
get landowners to agree to the company’s terms for construction.
We look forward to hearing from you.

Dear
Re: Provident Energy Pipeline inc. — NEB Beatton River Pipeline Replacement Project:
Entry on to Lands
Provident Energy Pipeline Inc. (”Provident") is writing to you as the owner of lands subject to an
easement agreement through which Provident will be undertaking the Beatton River Pipeline
Replacement Project (the "Replacement Project”). In doing so, Provident will be exercising the
rights it holds in relation to your lands under that easement which also grants rights for any
required temporary work space.
Beginning August 2010 Provident consulted you and other affected landowners to negotiate
compensation for damages to ensure the replacement is undertaken in a timely and reasonable
manner. The feedback from many landowners was a strong preference that construction occur
during the winter months, before the spring break-up. Provident is also in favor of construction
occurring during this period for safety reasons as the frozen ground during the winter months
will help to avoid any shift in the active operating pipelines located in the same and adjacent
rights of ways. In order to ensure construction is completed before spring break—up, Provident
must begin construction by February 1, 2011.
As we are now into early January, the window to complete this construction during the winter
period is rapidly closing. Provident has no choice but to proceed with construction despite the
fact we have not yet resolved the amount of compensation for related damages.
As a result of the easement agreements held by Provident in respect of your lands, Provident
currently has the legal rights required to undertake the Replacement Project. Provident wishes
to maintain a good working relationship with you and would prefer to have your consent to
commence the necessary work on your land. We remind you however, that your consent is not
legally required. Should we be unable to resolve the amount of damages, Provident notes that
the Arbitration Committee provisions of the National Energy Board Act esp. (35. 90-103). are the
proper forum in which to deal with those issues.
Provident must ensure timely access to your lands to ensure the continued safe,
environmentally responsible operation of its pipeline. Our right to carry out the activities
associated with the Replacement Project is fully supported by our easement agreement. Any
interference with our right to enter your lands and carry out the required work will be vigorously
resisted. We must put you on notice as well that any costs incurred by us in doing so together
with any construction delay costs incurred to move around your lands due to your obstruction of
our right of access will be your responsibility.

ENERGY LTD.
Provident is prepared now to agree to immediately refer the matter of compensation of damages
to the Arbitration Committee in order to expedite resolution of this matter should you so wish.
We require your confirmation by January 12. 2011 that you will permit Provident, and its
contractors. timely access to your lands to carry out the required work. In the absence of such
conﬁrmation, Provident has no alternative but to commence the mandatory right-of-entry
process with the relevant authorities to ensure timely access.

Attention: Anne-Marie Erickson
Saulteau First Nations (“Saulteau”) received the December 20, 2010 letter, from Transport
Canada on J anuary 10, 2011, for the proposed pipeline replacement and was asked to provide a
response by January 20, 2011.
Saulteau First Nations is a part of Treaty 8, which consists of Treaty and Aboriginal Rights.
Therefore, as a First Nation group we would like to ensure all environmental aspects are
respected appropriately, especially water. Water is the life source of all and is highly appreciated
in regards to culture and our mode of life. The Saulteau Lands Department has reviewed the
letter and are under the view that this project will not impede the Saulteau, however we must
emphasize that our Treaty and Aboriginal rights are to be respected.
Saulteau First Nations retains the authority to undertake further actions that may be required to
mitigate infringement on our Aboriginal and Treaty Rights by the proposed project.

Re: Provident Energy Pipeline Inc. —Beatton Pipeline Replacement Project:
Entry on to Lands
We are litigation counsel to Provident Energy Pipeline Inc. (“Provident”).
As you are aware from previous correspondence and discussions starting in August 2010 at the Cecil Lake
Community Hall, Provident will be undertaking the Beatton River Pipeline Replacement Project (the
’ “Replacement Project"). In doing so, Provident will be exercising the rights it holds in relation to your lands
\' under an easement which also grants Provident rights to any required temporary work space.
On January 7, 2011 Provident wrote to you advising that to ensure the continued safe, environmentally
responsible operation of its pipeline, it required timely access to your lands. Provident also advised in the
letter that it required your conﬁrmation by January 12, 2011 that you will permit Provident. and its
contractors, timely access to your lands to carry out the required work. You were also put on notice that in
the absence of Provident receiving your conﬁrmation that it would have no alternative but to commence
process with relevant authorities to ensure timely access.
Given that you have previously advised Provident or its agents that you refuse to allow timely access to your
lands as required under the easement and you have provided no response to the January 7, 2011 letter,
Provident has no choice but to conclude that it is your intention to interfere, obstruct or interrupt the
Replacement Project.
Accordingly, be advised that Provident intends to apply to the Supreme Court of British Columbia for an
order restraining you from interfering or othenNise denying Provident its right of access. Provident will also
be claiming damages and costs against you.
If Provident’s conclusion as to your intentions is incorrect, please contact us immediately or have your
lawyer contact us to prevent legal action from being commence against you.

Dear Anne-Marie,
Thank you for your consideration regarding the Provident Energy Pipeline Inc. proposed
Beatton River Replacement Project.
As this project is located north of the Peace River, it is outside of the McLeod Lake Indian
Band Traditional Territory. We appreciate your consultation on this project, though we can only
participate in the process by providing an advisory role to the other ﬁrst nations.
McLeod Lake Indian Band defers any other interests to the other First Nations communities
that may be directly impacted by this activity.

Dear Ms. Erickson.
Re: Provident Energy Pipeline Inc’s (Provident Energy) proposed Beatton River Pipeline Replacement
Project.
F urther to our telephone conversation of 14 January 2011, I as chairperson of the North Peace Landowner
Committee, NPLC/CAEPLA, respectfully request the National Energy Board to delay granting of a licence
and permits, to Provident Energy Ltd for their proposed Beatton River pipeline crossing project. NPLC is
composed of several landowners affected by this proposed project, and are associate members within the
Canadian Association of Energy and Pipeline Landowner Associations, commonly known as CAEPLA.
To provide you with a clearer understanding of Landowner concerns regarding this proposed project by
Provident Energy Pipeline, I will summarize for you the events as they have taken place from our ﬁrst
association with Provident, until now. These events are listed as follows:

0 10 August 2010, a meeting of Landowners affected by the pmposed Provident project, and Provident
representatives, was held at the Cecil Lake Community Hall. Provident Energy was requested earlier
to attend this meeting prepared to address three (3) primary areas of concern to the Landowners in
attendance, regarding the proposed project. These areas were:

1. Scope of the project.
2. Landowner Compensation package offered.
3. Recovery of the replaced pipe.

0 F ollowing the presentation, Provident was informed a Landowner meeting would be arranged to
discuss strategy for having Landowner issues addressed. There were a total of 34 Landowners in the
vicinity of the proposed pipeline project pathway.

0 1 September 2010, a second meeting was scheduled and attended by 31 Landowners. Dave Core
(Chairman and CEO of CAELPA) was in attendance and made a presentation to the Landowners. A
strong majority of Landowners chose to take an associate membership in CAEPLA’s organization,
forming NPLC/CAEPLA.

- 29 September 2010, Dave Core sent a letter informing Doug Haughey (President) and Ruel Santos
(Project Manager) of Provident Energy Pipeline Inc., regarding NPLC’s association with CAEPLA.

o 9 November 2010, Ruel Santos called CAEPLA’s ofﬁce to conﬁrm he had received the 29
September 2010 letter.

o 12 November 2010, letter from Dave Core to Ruel Santos sending Landowner signed authorization
and direction forms. This letter was also forwarded to Anna—Marie Erickson of the NEB. Provident
Energy ﬁnally responded to this letter to CAEPLA 28 December 2010.

o 1 December 201 O, a third meeting of concerned Landowners was held. Dave Core was in attendance.
Landowners elected a negotiating committee to negotiate with Provident regarding concerns and
issues of the Landowners with the assistance of CAEPLA.

0 17 December 2010, Brian Dunn of Roy Northern Land Service Ltd held a meeting attended by 7
Landowners affected by the Sec 58 Application for the Beatton River proposed replacement.

0 The majority of Landowners along the new portion of have not signed any agreements offered by
Roy Northern Land Service and Provident Energy Pipeline Ltd.

0 A list of Landowner concerns was forwarded to the NEB 23 December 2010.

The Landowners are extremely upset and angry about the tactics employed by Brian Dunn of Roy Northern
Land Service. In repeated attempts to obtain Landowner signatures authorizing Provident Energy’s proj ect to
proceed, Brian Dunn has bullied, lied to, harassed, intimidated, been disrespectful and minimized the dignity
of the Landowners. He has utilized insulting, threatening letters in an attempt to coerce Landowners to sign.
The stress level of many Landowners is at a critical level. Even though Provident Energy was advised
NPLC/CAEPLA were authorized to negotiate settlement of issues, they have totally disregarded this decision
of the Landowners. A number of the Landowners have severe medical complications and do not take kindly
to the use of these “strong arm” tactics.
We are requesting the NEB to require and insist, Provident Energy Pipeline Ltd mediate and negotiate with
NPLC/CAEPLA negotiating committee to resolve the issues of all Landowners affected by this project.
During our telephone conversation on January 14, 2011, you advised no project authorization or permits had
been issued for this project.
Should you require further information please email or call.
Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

       of original pipeline corridor Right of Entry fees as well as an effective beginning contractual date,
       with established renegotiation dates to reflect the change in monetary purchasing value. A
       contractual start date for the pipeline ROW compensation to Landowners, and ROW
       compensation review periods with set dates, based on the purchasing value of the Canadian
       dollar at each review anniversary period, compared to the dollar value as of January 1, 2011.
       Recovery of the decommissioned pipeline owned by Provident Energy - Landowners require
       that Provident Energy remove and recover all of the pipe which is to be replaced, out of the
       ground to reduce liability to landowners, and is in keeping with reducing soil contaminates to
       the landowners.
       Future abandonment of the current replacement pipeline project. In view of current minimum
       regulatory requirements with respect to future pipeline abandonment, and the issue of
       jurisdiction and abandoned pipelines, landowners require that provision for abandonment be
       included in project planning and that landowners have the option upon future abandonment to
       require removal of both future and existing lines. Provident Energy should also establish a fund
       to secure the costs of reclamation and other costs and damages associated with abandonment.
       Depth of Cover – Landowners are concerned that depth of cover over both existing and new
       pipelines be sufficient to accommodate modern agricultural cultivation practices and farm
       machinery, and to reduce potential for third party impact and damages which may result there
       from. Provident Energy’s proposed pipelines should be installed at a depth of cover no less than
       five (5) feet.
       Risk Assessment/Pipe Thickness – Landowners need to be satisfied that appropriate risk
       assessment has been completed, identifying and quantifying potential risks and outcomes so
       that appropriate design specifications are incorporated into the planning process to minimize
       risks to landowners, their families, and communities. This issue is of particular concern because
       of the product to be transported through the proposed pipeline.

 Indemnity – Landowners require provision in their easement agreements that Provident Energy
indemnify them with respect to any claims arising from Provident Energy’s pipeline operations.
Landowners also want Provident Energy to provide assurances with respect to adequate liability
insurance coverage covering construction and operation of the pipeline, both for Provident
Energy and its contractors, as well as detailed analytical information on the products being
transported in the pipelines through their properties.
Future Use – Landowners require that these pipelines be constructed to minimise interference
with the future use of their lands, and that Provident Energy be responsible for any costs
incurred in relation to changes in use attributable to the existence of this pipeline corridor.
Soil Management – There is proven soil and drainage disturbance and damage during
construction of pipelines that result in continuing production losses. Landowners are very
concerned that appropriate construction methodology and restoration measures are
implemented to minimize damage to virgin and vulnerable soils. Landowners require an
effective dispute resolution system for the resolution of construction issues. To that effect, they
require that an independent construction monitor be appointed to ensure that Provident
Energy’s commitments to landowners are fulfilled, and to assist a joint committee consisting of
Provident Energy and landowner representatives to resolve issues which arise during
construction.
Protection against Soil Contamination – Landowners require Provident Energy to ensure that
their lands will be protected against the importation of and contamination by disease, weeds,
and other contaminants as a result of the construction and operation of the pipelines. Provident
Energy must develop and employ an effective prevention and protection protocol where the
potential for contamination exists. The effective prevention and protection protocol will
include the Battleford Trail Group ‘Club Root Protocol’, and as such there will be no entry
granted to any contractor or surveyor on a NPLC member’s land until such time as CAEPLA
directs.
Water source Protection – Provident Energy must ensure that groundwater sources for human
and livestock consumption and for irrigation are protected during construction and operation of
the pipeline. Where it is possible that such sources may be affected by construction or
operational practices, quantitative and qualitative testing must be performed before and after,
and where the water source is affected, Provident Energy must establish an alternative source
to the satisfaction of the landowner.
Wet Soil Shutdown – Should Provident Energy be intending to work in wet soil conditions,
landowners require that they be consulted with respect to the nature and extent of the work to
be undertaken (with access to independent consultant advice), and that project planning include
provision for all technically feasible construction methods to minimize soil damage. In addition,
 landowners require that proposed compensation include provision for increased losses which
landowners will inevitably suffer if work proceeds in wet soil conditions.
Construction Access – Landowners require that the length of open trench be restricted during
construction and that reasonable provision be made to limit interference with their access to
agricultural lands.
Land Rights Compensation – With the creation of this utility corridor, landowners require that
compensation paid in advance of construction reflect not only the agricultural market value of
this land, but the intensification of its use and an annual payment renegotiated every five (5)
years to address the diminishment of the value of remaining lands both for more intensive
agricultural use and other development. Landowners also require a ditching fee, based on a
negotiated rate charge per meter.
Wood Lot Restoration and Compensation – Landowners are similarly concerned that
compensation paid in advance of construction, include provision for trees which will be
damaged or destroyed reflecting aesthetic and commercial value, and that satisfactory provision
be made for replacement and maintenance of equivalent trees.
Site Specific Construction Issues – Provident Energy must arrange with individual landowners in
advance of construction, to the extent it is possible to do so, to address site specific works,
damages, and compensation issues. Where these issues cannot be dealt with adequately in
advance, Provident Energy must ensure that landowners can have these issues addressed during
the construction process.
Disturbance Damages – Landowners are concerned that the utility corridor to be created by
Provident Energy’s proposed pipeline construction will result in increased, ongoing interference
in the conduct of their agricultural operations, and diminishment in the quality of life for them
and their families (including anxiety, stress, inconvenience, and the cost for landowners during
construction and operation of the pipeline). They require that compensation paid in advance of
construction, and as an annual payment recognize these impacts, both during construction and
forever thereafter during the operation of the pipeline.
Crop Loss Compensation – Landowners require compensation in advance of construction which
recognizes the production losses they will suffer on both easement and temporary use lands
during construction, and an annual payment for all future losses. This compensation must
include provision renegotiation to address the issues of anticipated future increases in prices
and productivity.
Control Zone
 Future Loss – Following construction and during the operation of the pipeline, landowners
require annual compensation, subject to periodic review, to address future land value,
disturbance, and production impacts.
Maintenance & Repairs – Landowners are concerned about maintenance and repair operations
conducted by Provident Energy on their lands with respect to the pipeline as it ages, and require
that an ancillary agreement be developed to cover such operations which includes provision for
scheduling of such activities; construction methods and restoration measures to be
implemented with respect to access, temporary use and dig site lands; minimum land rights,
disturbance and crop loss compensation to be paid in advance; and, provision for increased
compensation where these operations are carried out in wet soil conditions.

File: OF-Fac-Oil-Pl l 15-2010-01 01

Provident Energy Pipelines Inc. )”Provident”)

Beatton River Pipeline Replacement Project. (the “Proj ect”)
Dear Ms. Anne-Marie Erickson:
It is very regretful that I ﬁnd Mr Santos unabie to present facts truthfully when corresponding
with the National Energy Board regarding conversations between himself and me on details of
Provident’s Project. In particular, I refer to Mr. Santos’s letter of January 27, 2011. Mr. Santos
states that I refused entry to surveyors on my property, through Which Provident’s current
pipeline crosses.
The truth of the matter is that Mr. Santos knows very well what my position is regarding this
matter. During the evening after normal business hours, on January 13‘h 2011, Mr. Santos and
Brian Dunn sat at my dining table for the better pan of two hours, expounding on what Provident
going to do, regarding the replacement of the pipeline in question. I made it clear to him many
of the statements Mr. Dunn was saying were a blatant lie.
MI Santos reiterated that Provident had every right to access my land under the terms of an
easement their predecessor acquired in 1960. 1 informed him parameters surrounding and
attached to the easement of 1960 no longer apply in 2011. Everything in industxy and the world,
including the oil and gas industry, progresses and evolves, as time moves on. Furthermore, most
of the grantors in 1960 are long deceased, and would never endorse any easement given the
parameters and conditions of our present day. Mr. Santos even agreed it would be very hard to
ﬁnd willing Oil and Gas Companies to agree on easements endorsed ﬁfty years previous,
between themselves, and honour the terms ﬁfty years later without negotiations and changes.
I refreshed Mr. Santos’s memory a majority of Landowners had organized as a group, forming
the North Peace Landowner Committee (NPLC). NPLC members requested Canadian Energy
Pipeline Landowner Association’s (CAEPLA) help in negotiating with Provident to resolve the
concerns of affected Landowners along the proposed Project route. CAEPLA was authorized by
NPLA, and in association With them, requested (CAEPLA/NPLC) lead the negotiations with

01 Jan 11 Ud:ZUa T & R Skafte 250 781-3328 p2
Provident, to resolve the concerns of the Landowners effected by this Project. Provident was
also informed by CAEPLA by letter on 29 September 2010, of NPLC’s association and request
to CAEPLA. I also informed Mr. Santos at our evening meeting that I had been elected
democratically by NPLC/CAEPLA as chairperson of the group. As such, I represent the
interests of NPLC to CAEPLA, who is authorized to act on our behalf in negotiations. I invited
Mr Santos, as a representative for Provident, to enter into negotiations with NPLC/CAEPLA and
resolve the issues put forth by the majority of Landowners. When the issues of Landowners
were negotiated with NPLA/CAEPLA, and resoived, I would allow access by Provident, and
their contractors, to my property. Nevertheless, Provident has refused to negotiate with
NPLC/CAEPLA.

Regarding Mr. Santos’s remarks of my obj ections to the replacement project, please be advised
the project does intersect my property, and I am contacted daily by Landowners with issues on
all phases of the Proj ect and replacement portions, they want resolved.
The requests of NPLA/CAEPLA to Provident are sincere and important to the effected
Landowners, and need to be resolved Provident has had ample time, requests, and opportunity
to meet with NPLA/CAEPLA and negotiate and resolve Landowner concerns, since our ﬁrst
meeting in August and September of 2010. However, it appears they choose to harass,
intimidate, lie, and dehumanize the dignity of respectable Landowners.
MI Santos refers to the Landowners who are in agreement with Provident’s proposed work
Project. There are 12 Landowners who have signed Provident offered settlements along the
proposed route of the pipeline. However, he fails to acknowledge that 20 Landowners have not
signed, and have requested and authorized NPLC/CAEPLA to act on their behalf, to have issues
resolved.
As a qualiﬁed respected mediator and arbitrator, with membership on Rosters of both AAMS
and ADRIC, together with many years of experience in several areas of the oil and gas industry,
I ask that the NEB insist Provident meet with NPLC/‘CAEPLA in negotiations to resolve the
issues of the effected Landowners, prior to the granting of any licence under Sec 58 of the NEB
Act= or work permits for the O&M portions, until Provident negotiates with NPLC/CAEPLA .
To be fair and transparent, this must happen prior to any Arbitration hearings, of which Mr.
Santos speaks.
Thank you for your kind consideration of this request.
Yours truly,
Thor Skaﬁe, ~
Chairperson, NPLC/CAEPLA

Dear Ms. Erickson,
Re: Provident Energy Pipelines Inc. (“Provident”) letter dated February 1, 2011 (“the letter”)
I am writing in regard to Mr. Santos’s letter dated February 1, 2011. Mr. Santos mentions a number of
points I would like to clarify at this time.
Point a) of the letter – Mr. Santos states that Provident is not seeking land or access rights to the land of
Gerald Harmon, Cliff Bennett and Franz & Maya Wenger. Although this may be true, it is our
understanding that they are affected by the old line and as such have legitimate concerns that should be
addressed. Therefore, they remain those whose interests are represented by NPLC/CAEPLA.
In the case of Jacob Wiebe, it has been brought to my attention that the Section 58 portion of the
Beatton River Replacement Project affects one corner of a quarter of Mr. Wiebe’s land, and that
Provident has failed to contact him on this matter.
Point b) of the letter - I was informed on February 2, 2011 that Dennis Giesbrecht is no longer a
member of the North Peace Landowner Committee. However, we have not received written
confirmation of this. I will be looking into this matter further.
Point e) of the letter – It appears that Provident believes compensation is the main issue raised by
landowners. NPLC/CAEPLA would like to make it clear that whilst compensation is an important issue,
the other issues raised in both our letters of December 23, 2010 and January 27, 2011, that were filed
with the National Energy Board, are of equal importance. NPLC/CAEPLA are and have been willing to
negotiate these issues with Provident, as shown by a letter sent on September 29, 2010 (attached)to
which Provident failed to respond (as noted in a letter sent to them on November 9, 2010 – also
attached) and Mr. Skafte’s numerous invitations in emails.
Point g) of the letter – Mr. Santos mentions a former member of NPLC who has withdrawn his
membership; the former member he is referring to is Mr. David Wuthrich. However, Mr. Wuthrich was
not indicated as a member of NPLC/CAEPLA on the highlighted maps.
Page 5, Paragraph 2 - It should also be noted that although many landowners have stated that they
have a preference for winter construction, they did not state that this preference is for the winter of
2010/2011.

 CAEPLA has had many years experience dealing with energy companies across Canada. It’s our
perspective and the perspective of landowners involved, that members of NPLC/CAEPLA have not been
treated with dignity or respect by Provident thus far. NPLC/CAEPLA ask that its members be treated
fairly, allowing for their legitimate concerns to be addressed. Please see attached correspondence from
NPLC landowners.
I hope that this letter serves to bring understanding and if you have any questions, please contact me.

Dear Mr. Haughey and Mr. Santos,
RE: The Proposed Beatton River Replacement Project
As Chair and CEO of the Canadian Association of Energy and Pipeline Landowner Associations (CAEPLA), I
have been directed to inform you that 19 landowners affected by the proposed Beatton River
Replacement Project have formed a committee called the North Peace Landowner Committee (NPLC).
The NPLC is a committee of associate members of the Canadian Association of Energy and Pipeline
Landowner Associations that are directly impacted by Provident Energy Pipeline Inc’s proposed Beaton
River Pipeline Replacement Project.
 The aforementioned landowners have legally authorized and directed NPLC/CAEPLA to act on their
behalf in all discussions, negotiations and correspondence with respect to the proposed Beaton River
Pipeline Replacement Project application, in any related regulatory process or proceedings and
landowner consideration, including compensation. Please forward all correspondence to my attention at
the CAEPLA administration address below
The NPLC landowners have been provided with only very limited information to date with respect to this
project. These landowners are very concerned about this pipeline replacement proposal and the
effects the abandoned pipeline and the replacement pipeline will have on their families, lands and
businesses. We understand that you are committed to responsible and sustainable development and
therefore actively want to address the legitimate concerns these landowners have. Obviously, your
company shares the values that agricultural and other landowners have for their land.
 Landowners understand that sustainability also includes the inherent responsibility to stewardship of
the land for future generations and the understanding that they must act to address those
responsibilities when others want to impose projects on their lands. The legitimate issues and
challenges your project creates for these landowners, particularly in regard to stewardship
responsibilities, will require serious consultation and negotiation.
Upon receipt of your advice that Provident will be responsible for all reasonable legal, consultant and
negotiating committee costs incurred with respect to such negotiations, we will be pleased to discuss

 with you mutually convenient meeting arrangements. Since NPLC has only limited financial resources,
NPLC will require payment of such costs in an agreed budget amount in advance of negotiations.
We will be forwarding to you the authorizations and directions from each landowner member along
with a list of issues for which we will be seeking resolution.

Dear Mr. Santos,
RE: The Proposed Beatton River Replacement Project
As Chair and CEO of the Canadian Association of Energy and Pipeline Landowner Associations (CAEPLA), I
have been directed to inform you that 22 landowners affected by the proposed Beatton River Replacement
Project have formed a committee called the North Peace Landowner Committee (NPLC). The NPLC is a
committee of associate members of the Canadian Association of Energy and Pipeline Landowner Associations
that are directly affected by Provident Energy Pipeline Inc’s proposed Beaton River Pipeline Replacement
Project.
As mentioned in my previous letter (attached), dated September 29, 2010, landowners affected by the
proposed Beatton River Replacement Project have authorized NPLC/CAEPLA to act on their behalf in all
discussions, negotiations and correspondence with respect to this project. We understand that you did
receive the aforementioned letter but your company has chosen to not respond at this time.
I am forwarding to you, via email, all signed Authorization and Direction forms and ask that land agents
working on behalf of Provident Energy refrain from contacting landowners. We will continue to forward any
new Authorizations and Directions as they are received. Please forward all correspondence to my attention at
the CAEPLA address below and copy all emails to my secretary, Ms. Deborah McVicar at
Deborah@caepla.org. Please note that NPLC landowners do not want to be contacted (harassed) by land
agents when it has been made perfectly clear that they have authorized NPLC/CAEPLA to act on their behalf
at this time. In light of the fact that landowners have authorized NPLC/CAEPLA to act on their behalf, the
landowners will be advised to take legal action, if land agents continue to contact them.
Please also forward a copy of any and all proposed agreements that Provident Energy is proposing at this
time. We look forward to your earliest response.

Subject: Provident energy's treatment of NPLC members

Dear Ms. Barber,

My husband and I own property which is along the old route of the Provident pipeline they wish to replace
between Taylor and Goodlow, BC. Our property will not have the new pipeline. In September we, along with 2/3
of the other landowners affected by this work, signed an agreement with CAEPLA to negotiate a new pipeline
agreement and compensation.

It has been appalling how horribly our neighbors have been treated. Not once has Provident contacted
CAEPLA to set up negotiating meetings, yet they have repeatedly gone to our neighbors' homes, mostly
unannounced. Provident has been told repeatedly that CAEPLA is our negotiating agent. Provident has ignored
that, and with threatening letters and lies have tried to get the landowners to sign a deal. They suggest to the
landowners that to do the work in the winter, they need to sign right away. They refuse to acknowledge that it is
their company that has refused to negotiate with our representative - for ﬁve months now! This is unbelieveably
disrespectful. Had they begun proper negotiations in September, they would very likely be working on the project
now. Instead, they have tried to break up the NPLC group with lies and threats. They tell some landowners that
others have signed when they have not. They threaten with legal action if they do not sign right away. And just a
few days ago they wrote you a letter trying to blame Thor Skafte for riling up landowners against them. This is
just not so. Mr. Skafte was democratically elected as chairman of the NPLC, and has acted honorably and
worked very hard on our behalf. It is deeply angering to see how Provident is now bulllying, and continuing to lie
to you about what is happening with this pipeline. Now they are dropping off cheques - which I am sure they will
tell you are a sign that the landowners are ready for them to get to work. Twenty landowners of the 31 are not
signing until there is an acceptable agreement negotiated between NPLC/CAEPLA and Provident.

We are asking you, the NEB, to not issue any permits or Iiscences until Provident has negotiated -without
prejudice- a new agreement with us.

We also ask you to consider the consequenses for us landowners who will have this abandoned pipeline on our
property. With a new, more stable corridor being constructed, it means that the other pipeline companies will
also, in the next years, abandon their old pipelines and construct the new one in the new corridor. It will leave us
with a terrible environmental and ﬁnancial liability on our property that should not exist. So we ask that the old
pipeline be dug up now, and that the 100 foot easement given national piepelines be removed from our property.
Respectfully,

Franz and Maya Wenger

Subject: RE: Provident pipe line concerns
To Margaret Barber & the NEB
Below you will find a list of concerns that I would like on record regarding the above proposed
Pipe Line
    1. I can be available the first week of May for a hearing with the NEB Board.
    2. We have a concern on the Routing of the pipeline regarding (1) of our quarters in how it
       will affect the opportunity to build on the mentioned quarter. It is necessary to re route
       the line on this quarter to meet both our future opportunities and the pipeline.
    3. It is to the best interest of all parties to negotiate directly with Provident first on all issues
       of the pipeline easement prior to NEB consideration of their permit. The negotiations
       need to be open and above all with factual information and not as if Provident has a gun
       to our heads. Only if necessary we can then turn to mediation and finally arbitration.
    4. It is imperative to have the right to negotiate the proposed easement based on the current
       and future issues well prior to NEB consideration of the proposed pipeline. This is very
       evident from the current information and treatment of the land owners on the old portion
       of the line proposed to be replaced.
    5. Access and trespassing on our land should not take place until we have a signed
       agreement with Provident.
    6. The propose pipeline route is a benefit for Provident over the current routing used over
       the last 50+- years. Provident has been aware of the need to replace the old line and the
       need to reroute new proposed line for sometime. In knowing this Provident has totally
       disregarded the need to address and negotiate the concerns of the landowners.
    We look forward to the assistance of the NEB to require Provident to negotiate at arms length

Dear Ms. Kuchinski and Ms. Barber,
I find the challenges presented to the NPLC/CAEPLA landowners affected by the Provident
Pipelines maintenance, decommissioning and replacement project most disconcerting. As I look
at the September 2008 changes to the Onshore Pipeline Regulations, it would appear to me that
those changes might be responsible for most of the controversy. I have included copies of two
CAEPLA letters, one from 2005 and another from 2007 concerning those proposed changes.
Upon review of postings on your website I would suggest that my 2007 letter was taken out of
context and I further have concerns that the 2005 letter was not posted. The fact that my 2007
letter was taken out of context, and did not identify the reference to the February 2005 letter,
concerning funding for our input, only further reinforces the need for full funding to hire experts
and legal counsel when taking part in NEB processes and consultation. Landowners are imposed
upon by these projects, they do not profit from the imposition and therefore cannot finance full
and effective participation that hold the NEB accountable. It seems that landowners again pay a
hefty price for NEB initiatives that only effectively include the influence of the industry in the
development of regulatory change.
Obviously the lack of effective participation by landowners in these changes has again left
landowners in a very precarious situation concerning their property and their families. Many
landowners on this project feel helpless while bearing the imposed risks and costs that belong to
industry.
It appears that landowners directly affected by the Provident Projects have been abandoned by
the NEB. It appears that the Onshore Regulations have compromised the rule of law and due
process in this and other applications. Would you please confirm the process that Provident was
to follow in this application and where in that process landowner issues could have been
addressed, in particular on the replacement of the pipeline under Operations and Maintenance. I
still await a copy of the Schedule A form provided to you by Provident for the exemption order.
Provident recently provided NPLC/CAEPLA with a November 2010 Environmental Report, I
have not been able to find it at the document site. It is of interest that it was not available at the
Feb 18th NEB meeting in Fort St John. Could you direct me to where it was posted in November
of 2010.

and Other Interested Stakeholders
Amendments to the Onshore Pipeline Regulations, 1999 (OPR) and National Energy Board
Processing Plant Regulations (PPR) and Guidance Notes and Exemption Order -
Decommissioning Provisions
Decommissioning amendments to the Onshore Pipeline Regulations, 1999 and the National
Energy Board Processing Plant Regulations have come into force as of their publication in the
Canada Gazette Part II on 17 September 2008. These amendments create a requirement to apply
to the Board when a company is planning to permanently cease operation of facilities where the
cessation does not result in a discontinuance of service.
Guidance Notes and Exemption Order XG-XO-100-2008 that accompany the decommissioning
amendments are attached. The Board developed the Guidance Notes and Exemption Order in
parallel with the amendments to ensure clarity and consistency. During initial consultations on
the amendments in 2003, the Board determined that many suggestions could be addressed in
guidance notes or in a decommissioning exemption order. Draft guidance notes and an
exemption order were prepared and discussed with stakeholders.
Subsequent to 2003, the Board made some important changes to its section 58 Streamlining
Order [Folder 255376] and also issued the new Requirements for the Operations and
Maintenance Activities on Pipelines Regulated under the NEB Act. The draft decommissioning
guidance notes and an exemption order were revised in the spring of 2007 considering the new
section 58 Streamlining Order requirements, and efforts have been made to avoid duplication.
Stakeholders were given a final opportunity to comment on the amendments over a thirty day
period, when they were published in the Canada Gazette, Part I on 10 November 2007, and when
the Board issued a letter on 14 November 2007 offering the same. The Board received two letters
 of comment which did not result in any changes to the amendments. Stakeholders also had a
final opportunity to comment on the Guidance Notes and Exemption Order over the period
14 November 2007 to 15 January 2008. The Board received one letter of comment and some
informal comments which resulted in some wording changes to clarify meaning in the Guidance
Notes. No changes were made to the Exemption Order.
The Board intends to monitor compliance with the Regulations by reviewing specifications and
procedures to be used by the regulated companies, by auditing their records and activities to
determine their adequacy and effectiveness, and by performing inspections of onshore pipelines
during their operating life.
The Board's Gas/Oil Pipeline Uniform Accounting Regulations require companies to retire from
their books any assets which have been removed from service. Accordingly, the decommissioned
assets should be removed from rate base for toll purposes. In their annual reporting, Group 1
companies are to advise the Board of the proposed accounting treatment in accordance with
sections 39 (ordinary retirement) or 40 (extraordinary retirement) of the Gas/Oil Pipeline
Uniform Accounting Regulations.
If you have any questions related to the decommissioning amendments or the Guidance Notes
and Exemption Order, please contact the Regulatory Development Team at (403) 299-3628 or
toll-free at 1-800-899-1265.

 Guidance Notes for the Decommissioning Provisions under
the Onshore Pipeline Regulations, 1999 (OPR)
Definitions
"abandon" means to permanently cease operation such that the cessation results in the
discontinuance of service.
"decommission" means to permanently cease operation such that the cessation does not result in
the discontinuance of service.
"operate" includes repair, maintain, deactivate, reactivate and decommission.
Decommissioning Provisions
45.1 (1) If a company proposes to decommission a pipeline or part of one, the company shall
submit an application for the decommissioning to the Board.
(2) The company shall include in the application the reasons, and the procedures that are to be
used, for the decommissioning.
GOAL (s. 45.1): To ensure that decommissioning of a pipeline, or part of a pipeline, is carried
out in a safe, efficient, and environmentally responsible manner that respects landowners' rights.
Section 74 of the National Energy Board Act requires leave of the Board to abandon a pipeline.
The Onshore Pipeline Regulations, 1999 (OPR) previously defined abandon as "to remove
permanently from service". The Board interpreted the abandonment provisions to require an
application only where there was a discontinuation of service to end users. Now abandon means
to permanently cease operation of a pipeline or part of one such that cessation results in the
discontinuance of service. In contrast, decommissioning is intended to capture the permanent
cessation of operation of a pipeline, or part of one, that does not result in a discontinuance of
service.
Service is defined as the ability of a pipeline, as a whole, to transport hydrocarbons to an end
point. For clarification, when a company's actions result in one line in a series of looped lines
(collectively the pipeline) being no longer able to transport hydrocarbons, this would generally
be decommissioning rather than an abandonment since, as a whole, the other looped lines are
still able to transport hydrocarbons and provide the same level of service. Companies are
encouraged to consult with Board staff if additional guidance is required regarding the
distinction between abandonment and decommissioning.
The requirement for companies to seek approval to decommission facilities would allow the
Board to examine the application to ensure the continued safe operation of the pipeline and
assess the environmental effects of the project, and this could entail the same level of
information required as in an abandonment application. It is important to note that a
 decommissioning application does not require a public hearing (although the Board could hold
one if necessary) and does not trigger the Canadian Environment Assessment Act.
Companies should consult the guidance material under the Filing Manual Guide B Abandonment
and section 50 of the OPR, Application for Leave to Abandon.

43.1(1) If a company proposes to decommission a processing plant or part of one, the company
shall submit an application for the decommissioning to the Board.
(2) The company shall include in the application the reasons, and the procedures that are to be
used, for the decommissioning.
GOAL (s. 43.1): To ensure that decommissioning of a processing plant, or part of one, is carried
out in a safe, efficient, and environmentally responsible manner.
Section 74 of the National Energy Board Act requires leave of the Board to abandon a processing
plant. The National Energy Board Processing Plant Regulations (PPR) previously defined
abandon as "to remove permanently from service". The Board interpreted the abandonment
provisions to require an application only where there was a discontinuation of service to end
users. Now abandon means to permanently cease operation of a processing plant or part of one
such that cessation results in the discontinuance of service. In contrast, decommissioning is
intended to capture the permanent cessation of operation of a processing plant or part of one that
does not result in a discontinuance of service.
The requirement for companies to seek approval to decommission facilities would allow the
Board to examine the application to ensure the continued safe operation of the processing plant

Schedule A
Process for Identifying Projects Subject to
Exemption Order XO/XG-100-2008
Preface
Schedule A is to be used to determine whether a project under the Act is subject to Exemption
Order XG-XO-100-2008 (the Order), in which case, an application to the Board is not required.
Copies of Schedule A are not required to be physically completed, filed, or retained for those
projects undertaken pursuant to the Order. However, companies and persons may be required,
either upon request of the Board or during a Board audit, to demonstrate that projects undertaken
pursuant to the Order were properly subject to this Order.
In determining whether a project under the Act is subject to Exemption Order XG-XO-100-2008,
companies shall ensure that the project is within the list of eligible projects listed in Step 1.
It is important to note the following:
        The Order only applies to projects related to the decommissioning of an existing oil or
        gas pipeline or processing plant for which a Board certificate or order is in place or which

  Dear Ms. Randall and Ms. Barber
Please find attached a letter from Provident Pipeline to a landowner that was copied to CAEPLA.
NPLC/CAEPLA would like the NEB to advise the validity of the claims made by the company
under NEB regulations. It appears to be very threatening. We would also request the appropriate
manner in which to file this letter in this application. There appears to be some misunderstanding
with this project application and NEB regulations. I have to admit that it appears the process is
not very transparent. I left telephone messages for both of you yesterday concerning this issue.

Re: Letter of March 30, where Provident requests their Supplementary Geotechnical Evaluation Report to be filed in
confidence. I would request that the Board keep this report public. One of the main problems that Landowners have
had with Provident is communication of truthful information. Therefore it is deeply disturbing that this report should
be kept confidential. Why, when the report has to do with activity on our land, would we, the landowner, not be
allowed to know what is in that report? I believe that this information will be important to the Hearing on May 5, and it
is a right of the Landowner to have all information about what is happening on this pipeline replacement project be
made public without delay. Respectfully, Maya Wenger

Re: Letter of March 30 2011, Request by Provident to keep a Supplementary Geotechnical Evaluation report
confidential. As an affected Landowner, I have the right to know everything that is going on with this pipeline project.
I need to know the details in this report, because it affects me and the environment in my neighborhood. I need to
have this information before the May 5th hearing, so that I can speak intelligently to this Board about my concerns
with the report, should there be any. As a result of my past experiences with Provident Energy, I have a lack of
confidence in the information Provident provided, and their interpretation of it. It makes me suspicious, when
Provident requests that this report be confidential. If there is nothing to hide, why not make it public to the
Landowners?

Dear Ms Erickson,
RE: Hearing Order OH-02-2011, Provident Energy Pipeline Inc, Proposed Beatton River Replacement
Project
The Canadian Association of Energy and Pipeline Landowner Associations (CAEPLAV North Peace
Landowner Committee (NPLC) propose that Section 16.1 of the National Energy Board Act does not
apply to the Provident Energy Pipeline inc. supplementary geotechnicai report on slope stability of the
proposed Beatton River Replacement Project. This information should not be confidential and is critical
as landowners and other stakeholders take part in the NEE hearing dated May 5, 2011. This project and
reroute is being proposed to address slope stability issues on the existing Boundary Lake Plpeiine route.
it is therefore imperative that the siOpe stability information on the proposed route be made public and
be provided to the landowner: newly imposed upon, to Justify the impact to their families, businesses.
pmperty and their stewardship responsibilities. Both landowners and other stakeholders are concerned
about the increased environmental footprint and the additional environmental Impact: to the river and
other iands. This information is not proprietary and should not be conﬁdential.
Provident has notiﬁed the Board that the report wiii not be completed untii the end of April. This
document is crucial to our and other sta kehoidefs participation In the May 5 hearing and to the decision
of the NEB. As a result of the delay In the production of this document, CAEPLA/NPLC request a delay of
this hearing untii after our landowner members have completed spring seeding, to allow time for our
members to fully review this document.

Mr. Dylan Adderley
 National Energy Board

Calgary, AB T2P 0X8
Dear Mr. Adderley:
Re: Canadian Environmental Assessment Act Screening
Beatton River Replacement Project
Environment Canada Advice
I am writing in response to your letter dated October 8, 2010 that seeks confirmation of Environment Canada’s role in
a federal environmental assessment of the above-noted project.
Based on the information provided, Environment Canada has made the following determination in accordance with
the Regulations Respecting the Coordination by Federal Authorities of Environmental
Assessment Procedures and Requirements:
• The department is not likely to be a Responsible Authority for this project under the Canadian Environmental
Assessment Act.
• The department is in possession of specialist or expert information or knowledge that could be relevant to the
environmental assessment required by Fisheries and Oceans Canada. As such, Environment Canada is prepared to
participate in the environmental assessment as a Federal Authority, and provides the following advice (attached) with
respect to water quality, wildlife, species at risk, and wetlands:
o Environment Canada Interim Guidance for Addressing Water Quality for Work In and Around Water; and
o Environment Canada –Canadian Wildlife Service, Pacific and Yukon Region: Wildlife Advice for Environmental
Assessment (Advice for Industry).
Additionally, Environment Canada recommends that the following wildlife guidance document be used in preparing
the Environmental Assessment Report: “Addressing Species at Risk Act Considerations Under the Canadian
Environmental Assessment Act for Species Under the Responsibility of the Minister responsible for Environment
Canada and Parks Canada” (Environment Canada and Parks Canada, 2010).
Environment Canada has reviewed the “Beatton River Replacement Project Application Pursuant to Section 58 of the
NEB Act” (the Application) (Provident Energy Pipeline Inc., September 2010) and herein offers specialist advice on
species at risk, migratory birds, wetlands, and vegetation.
SPECIES AT RISK
The purpose of the Species at Risk Act (SARA) is to prevent or reduce the likelihood of wildlife species from becoming
extinct or extirpated, to provide for the recovery of wildlife species that are extirpated, endangered or threatened as a
result of human activity, and to manage species of special concern to prevent them from becoming endangered or
threatened.
SARA was proclaimed on June 5, 2003 and affords protection to those wildlife species listed in Schedule 1 of the Act.
The prohibitions under SARA came into force on June 1, 2004, and apply to individuals of a species, their residences
(dwelling places, such as a den or nest or other similar area that is occupied or habitually occupied by one or more
individual during part or all of its life cycle), and critical habitat (areas used or formerly used by the species to carry
out their life processes that are deemed essential for survival or recovery). Critical habitat will be identified for each
listed species in Recovery Strategies and/or Action Plans, available on Environment Canada’s Species at Risk Act
Public Registry:
www.sararegistry.gc.ca.
The Canada-British Columbia Agreement on Species at Risk commits the Province to assess species under its
jurisdiction. Environment Canada may offer an opinion on the adequacy of mitigation measures accepted by the
Province of British Columbia.
Environment Canada recommends the following linked documents:
• “Best Management Practices for Amphibians and Reptiles in Urban and Rural Environments in British
 Columbia”(www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/BMP/herptile/bmpherptile.htm);
• “Best Management Practices for Raptor Conservation during Urban and Rural Land Development in British
Columbia” (www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/documents/bmp/raptor_bmp_final.pdf); and
be consulted in the design and construction of this project. These manuals provide guidance on maintaining the
viability of native species in urban and rural areas of British Columbia subject to land development activities.
Project Specific Comments
The Application notes that “snags were frequently encountered in forested areas…” (page 6, section 5.2.2, appendix
C). Environment Canada recommends that the proponent retain wildlife trees and snags to protect the habitat of
cavity nesting birds. If retention of these trees is not feasible, then Environment Canada recommends that nest boxes
be constructed to mitigate for the loss of bird nesting opportunities. The type of nest boxes should be appropriate for
the bird species currently using the project site. More information on nest boxes is available on the Hinterland’s Who’
s Who website at: www.hww.ca/hww2.asp?id=228.
MIGRATORY BIRDS
Under the current regulatory framework pursuant to the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994 (MBCA), the Migratory
Bird Regulations contain a blanket prohibition against the disturbance, destruction or take of the nests, eggs, nest
shelter, eider duck shelter or duck box of migratory birds. Most birds in British Columbia are covered under the
MBCA and/or the Species at Risk Act. All birds native to North America as per the American Ornithological Union's
checklist are also protected by the provincial Wildlife Act. In addition, the provincial legislation covers raptors, native
upland game birds, and some non-native upland game birds introduced for hunting purposes (quail, partridge,
pheasant, turkey). The provincial legislation also includes year-round protection of nests, whether occupied or not,
of, for example, eagles, peregrines, Gyrfalcons, Ospreys, Burrowing Owls and Great Blue Herons. As such, further
guidance from the BC Ministry of Natural Resources Operations (MNRO) is advised.
Within the mandate of the Canadian Wildlife Service under the current federal legislation, Environment Canada
recommends industry avoids activities that will or have the potential to harm migratory birds, disturb or destroy their
eggs or active nests. The migratory bird breeding season varies across BC. The period peak breeding period for
most, but not all, migratory birds in southwest BC is between March 15th and August 15th. Raptors, herons, cavity
nesters, and other resident species may begin nesting even earlier than the dates noted above.
Where industry determines its activities will overlap with the breeding bird season and cannot be avoided,
Environment Canada recommends management plans be developed and implemented to minimize potential risks and
reduce any adverse effects.
WETLANDS
Wetlands are a priority for Environment Canada because of their importance to, amongst other things, the
maintenance of migratory bird populations for which the department has a responsibility under the MBCA, and
protection of species at risk for which the department has a responsibility under SARA.
The Application notes that the proposed pipeline route will cross one wetland and a number of ephemeral, undefined
depressional areas that showed seasonal drainage (page 7, section 4.5, appendix B). Environment Canada
recommends that impacts to wetlands be avoided to ensure that effects to listed wildlife species arising from the
project are minimized.
Environment Canada recommends that the provincial red- and blue-listed ecological wetland communities be
identified within the project area. The definitions for provincial red- and blue-lists are as follows:
• Red list: includes any ecological community, and indigenous species and subspecies that is extirpated, endangered,
or threatened in British Columbia; and
• Blue list: includes any ecological community, and indigenous species and subspecies considered to be of special
concern (formerly vulnerable) in British Columbia.
If red- or blue-listed wetlands are found within the project area, then Environment Canada would recommend that a
 wetland compensation plan be required if project impacts cannot be fully avoided (i.e. where there are residual
impacts after all minimization efforts have been applied).
VEGETATION
The Application also mentions that a supplemental late-season rare plant surveys is planned to assess vegetation
impacts arising from realignment of the Beatton River crossing (page 10, Section 5.1, Appendix B). Environment
Canada supports this sampling recommendation and may provide specific advice on appropriate vegetation
mitigation (including compensation) once this data is submitted to the National Energy Board.
As disturbed habitats are prone to invasive plant species colonization, which threaten local biodiversity, Environment
Canada recommends that an invasive species management plan be developed to address potential project impacts.
Guidance on invasive weed management can be found on the BC Ministry of Agriculture weed webpage at:
www.agf.gov.bc.ca/cropprot/weeds.htm.
CLOSING
The proponent should be aware that Section 36(3) of the federal Fisheries Act, administered by Environment Canada,
prohibits the discharge of deleterious substances to waters frequented by fish, or to a place where those substances
might enter such waters. Therefore, the proponent must ensure that, at all times during the project, deleterious
substances are prevented from entering into fish-bearing waters or any tributaries. Due diligence is required at all
times to prevent such discharges, and adherence to the proposed courses of action suggested in this letter does not
relieve the proponent of the requirement to comply with the Fisheries Act.
This advice does not constitute an approval. The proponent shall ensure that all work associated with the subject
project complies with the requirements of the Fisheries Act, the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, the
Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994, the Species at Risk Act and all other applicable laws, legislation, and best
management practices.
Please consider this as fulfilling Environment Canada’s obligations under Section 12(3) of CEAA. In order for us to
evaluate the effectiveness of our advice, we would appreciate receiving a copy of your Decision Statement. Thank
you for the opportunity to provide remarks on this proposal. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to
contact me at (604) 666-3567.
Yours sincerely,

ENVIRONMENT CANADA
INTERIM GUIDANCE FOR ADDRESSING WATER QUALITY FOR WORK IN AND AROUND WATER
Introduction
The following guidelines have been prepared to provide general water quality advice for small projects involving
construction in and around marine and fresh water that may be frequented by fish, including, for example, docks,
bridges, shoreline protection, pile driving, etc.
These guidelines apply to only to Environment Canada’s areas of concern, primarily for the protection of water quality.
The proponent is advised to contact the regional Fisheries and Oceans Canada office if the project may result in any
 potential harmful alteration, disruption or destruction of fish habitat.
Guidelines
1. The proponent shall ensure that all plans and specifications relating to this project have been duly prepared and
reviewed by appropriate professionals working on its behalf.
2. The proponent should be aware that Section 36(3) of the federal Fisheries Act, administered by Environment
Canada, prohibits the discharge of deleterious substances to waters frequented by fish. Therefore, the proponent
must ensure that deleterious substances from the project are prevented from discharging into fish-bearing waters or
any tributaries. Due diligence is required at all times to prevent such discharges. Adherence to the advice of this
document does not relieve the proponent of its ongoing responsibilities in this regard.
3. All work associated with the project involving the use of concrete, cement, mortars and other Portland cement or
lime-containing construction materials shall be conducted so as to ensure that sediments, debris, concrete, and
concrete fines are not deposited, either directly or indirectly into the aquatic environment. Any water contacting
uncured or partly cured concrete or Portland cement or lime-containing construction materials, such as the water that
may be used for exposed aggregate wash-off, wet curing, equipment and truck washing, etc. shall be prevented from
entering, directly or indirectly, the aquatic environment unless this water has been tested and found to have a pH of
between 6.5 and 9.0 and a turbidity of less than 25 NTU. Containment facilities shall be provided at the site for the
wash-down water from concrete delivery trucks, concrete pumping equipment, and other tools and equipment as
required.
4. The proponent shall ensure that sediment or sediment laden waters or other deleterious substances are not allowed
to enter the aquatic environment during the proposed work. Work should be conducted in accordance with best
management practices, for example the sediment and erosion provisions of the Land Development Guidelines for the
Protection of Aquatic Habitat (Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 1993, available at
http://www-heb.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/publications/pdf/165353.pdf).
5. An appropriate spill prevention, containment, and clean up contingency plan for hydrocarbon products (e.g., fuel,
oil, hydraulic fluid, etc.), and other deleterious substances shall be put in place prior to work commencing, and
appropriate spill containment and cleanup supplies shall be kept available onsite whenever the works are occurring.
Further, all personnel working on the project should be familiar with implementing the spill clean up plan and the
deployment of spill response materials.
6. Any fuel handling or storage associated with the project should comply with the Canadian Council of Ministers of
the Environment (CCME) Environmental Code of Practice for Aboveground and Underground Storage Tank Systems
Containing Petroleum Products and Allied Petroleum Products (2003). Please be aware that Environment Canada
currently has proposed Storage Tank Systems for Petroleum Products and Allied Petroleum Products Regulations
under CEPA, 1999. It is anticipated these Regulations will be published and come into force during early 2008.
7. If land-based equipment or machinery is used to conduct the proposed works, the equipment/machinery should
operate from the upland or operate from the intertidal foreshore within the footprint of the proposed works. Impacts
to the intertidal foreshore outside the footprint of the proposed works must be prevented.
8. All machinery used on site should be in good repair and free of excess oil and grease. Any fuelling or maintenance
of such equipment should occur on the upland well away from the foreshore.
9. Any material, such as rip rap, gravel, etc., placed below the higher high water mark must be free of silt, overburden,
debris or any other substances deleterious to aquatic life.
10. A dock facility should be designed and located so as to preclude tidal grounding of any floating component on the
foreshore.
11. No unserviced float homes or live-aboard vessels should be moored at a dock facility. Sewage discharges from
ships must adhere to Subdivision 4 – Sewage Discharges of the Canada Shipping Act.
12. Under the Fisheries Act, Management of Contaminated Fisheries Regulations, the harvesting of bivalve molluscs,
(oysters, clams, mussels) is prohibited for any purpose within 125 metres of any wharf, dock, platform or other
structure used for vessel moorage, or any permanently anchored floating structure, including float homes, barges,
platforms and vessels. It is the proponent’s responsibility to ensure commercial, recreation and First Nation shellfish
harvesting opportunities are not hindered by placement of such structures.
13. Any timber preservatives are to be applied in a manner consistent with current best management practices such
as Appendix 2, Requirements for Using Treated Wood, in the guidebook Environmentally Sustainable Log Handling
Facilities in British Columbia (Fisheries and Oceans Canada, April 2003). Available at
http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/274124.pdf.
14. General log handling operations have the potential to cause serious impacts to the local environment through the
 aquatic deposition of large amounts of secondary woodwaste (i.e. bark chips, etc.). To reduce the amounts of
woodwaste introduced into the environment through log handling activities, please refer to DFO published guidebook,
Environmentally Sustainable Log Handling Facilities in British Columbia, available at:
http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/274124.pdf. Information regarding the log bundling strand recycling initiative is
provided with the covering email
15. If steel piles are to be used, they must be capped to prevent the entry of wildlife.
16. All demolition materials are to be disposed of upland in an authorized manner. In this regard, it should be noted
that burning of preservative treated timber is not permitted. Whenever possible, recycling of materials is encouraged.
17. Only clean, uncontaminated material may be used as fill.
WILDLIFE ADVICE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS
ENVIRONMENT CANADA - CANADIAN WILDLIFE SERVICE
PACIFIC AND YUKON REGION
ADVICE TO INDUSTRY
Introduction
The Canadian Wildlife Service of Environment Canada offers the following general advice on addressing wildlife and
wildlife habitat within an environmental assessment, in accordance with the department’s mandate. For more
detailed advice, proponents are encouraged to consult the additional guidance documents available on Environment
Canada’s website at:
http://www.ec.gc.ca/nature/default.asp?lang=En&n=132ADBFC-1&parent=0C1743A2-4D49-4183-AC5F-1DE909D2FEB1
Migratory Birds and Incidental Take
Incidental take refers to the killing of migratory birds, and/or the disturbance or destruction of their nests or eggs
resulting directly or indirectly from human activities, where the primary objective of the activity is not the killing of
migratory birds and/or the disturbance or destruction of their nests or eggs. Environment Canada expects due
diligence be exercised to avoid harm to migratory birds.
Under the current regulatory framework pursuant to the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994 (MBCA), Environment
Canada recommends that proponents avoid conducting project-related activities during times that have the potential
to harm migratory birds or their active nests. The department is currently in the process of developing best
management practices and avoidance guidelines that will provide direction to industry and the general public on this
matter, and concomitantly support the conservation of migratory birds, as individuals and as populations.
The migratory bird breeding season varies between regions across British Columbia. The period from March 15th to
August 15th will generally include breeding activity for most, though not all, avian species across the province.
Environment Canada can advise on more specific breeding periods on a project-by-project basis.
In the event a proponent determines that its activities will unavoidably overlap with the breeding bird season,
Environment Canada expects due diligence be exercised to avoid harm to migratory birds, and recommends that the
proponent employ an Active Migratory Bird Nest Survey (AMBNS) program to reduce the likelihood of disturbing or
destroying active nests. Doing so reduces the likelihood that the proponent will be in contravention of the MBCA.
Environment Canada recommends that an AMBNS be employed if potentially harmful activities are proposed for a
period immediately before, during or immediately after the general breeding bird season.
Please contact Environment Canada for a list of technical reports, papers or other information relating to migratory
birds and their habitats within British Columbia.
Species at Risk
The purpose of the Species at Risk Act (SARA) is to prevent or reduce the likelihood of wildlife species from becoming
extinct or extirpated, to provide for the recovery of wildlife species that are extirpated, endangered or threatened as a
result of human activity, and to manage species of special concern to prevent them from becoming endangered or
threatened.
SARA was proclaimed on June 5, 2003 and affords protection to those wildlife species listed in Schedule 1 of the Act.
 The prohibitions under SARA came into force on June 1, 2004, and apply to individuals of a species, their residences
(dwelling places, such as a den or nest or other similar area that is occupied or habitually occupied by one or more
individual during part or all of its life cycle), and critical habitat (areas used or formerly used by the species to carry
out their life processes that are deemed essential for survival or recovery). Critical habitat will be identified for each
listed species in Recovery Strategies and/or Action Plans, available on Environment Canada’s Species at Risk Act
Public Registry: www.sararegistry.gc.ca.
Subsection 79(1) of SARA requires every person who is required by a federal Act to ensure that a federal
environmental assessment is conducted to notify the competent Minister(s) without delay if the project is likely to
affect a listed wildlife species or its critical habitat. Subsection 79(2) of SARA requires that, where a federal
environmental assessment is being carried out on a project that may affect a listed wildlife species or its critical
habitat, the person responsible for ensuring the assessment is conducted must identify potential adverse effects on
the listed wildlife species and its critical habitat; and, if the project is carried out, ensure that measures are taken to
avoid or lessen those adverse effects and to monitor them, and ensure that such measures are consistent with any
applicable Recovery Strategy and/or Action Plans. Subsection 79(3) defines ‘person’ as including an association or
organization, and a responsible authority as defined in subsection 2(1) of the Canadian Environmental Assessment
Act (CEAA).
In managing a project in the context of species at risk, proponents are advised to identify and evaluate likely species
occurrences (including methods such as conducting baseline surveys), assess environmental impacts, develop
mitigation strategies and follow-up monitoring plans. The advice below is offered to assist in this process.
1.Complete an in-depth literature review of relevant databases to determine whether any species of concern are
known or expected to use the proposed project site or adjacent lands if they are within the zone of influence of the
project. This may include:
o The BC Conservation Data Centre (CDC) database (for any rare element occurrence records), including the ‘Species
and Ecosystem Explorer search tool’;
o Environment Canada’s Species at Risk Act Public Registry: www.sararegistry.gc.ca (for Recovery Strategies, Action
Plans, Species Accounts);
o The BC Sensitive Ecosystem Inventory: www.env.gov.bc.ca/sei;
o Environment Canada’s Species at Risk search tool: www.speciesatrisk.gc.ca to determine if the ranges of any
Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) listed species overlap with the site; and,
o Scientific journals (many available on-line).
2. Consult with government and non-government agencies and organizations, such as:
o federal departments with responsibility for species at risk: Fisheries and Oceans Canada (for aquatic species), Parks
Canada (for species that occur primarily in national parks), and Environment Canada (for all other species);
o the BC Ministry of the Environment, municipalities and regional districts;
o Species at Risk Recovery Teams; and
o Local naturalist groups and organizations.
3. Complete surveys, following accepted standards and methodologies, of the project area (and adjacent areas as
necessary). The appropriate government jurisdiction – provincial or federal – should be consulted for advice on
survey design. Permits under the BC Wildlife Act or SARA may be required in certain circumstances.
To assist proponents in accounting and managing for species at risk, Environment Canada has developed the
following environmental assessment guidance documents:
1. Environmental Assessment Best Practice Guide for Wildlife at Risk in Canada
2. Addressing Species at Risk Act Considerations Under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act for Species
Under the Responsibility of the Minister Responsible for Environment Canada and Parks Canada
3. The Species at Risk Environmental Checklists for Species Under the Responsibility of the Minister Responsible for
Environment Canada and Parks Canada
These documents will be reviewed and updated on a regular basis; the most up-to-date versions are available at:
http://www.ec.gc.ca/nature/default.asp?lang=En&n=132ADBFC-1&parent=0C1743A2-4D49-4183-AC5F-1DE909D2FEB1
 Federal Wetland Policy
Proponents are encouraged to refer to the Federal Policy on Wetland Conservation, available at:
http://www.ec.gc.ca/nature/default.asp?lang=En&n=132ADBFC-1&parent=0C1743A2-4D49-4183-AC5F-1DE909D2FEB1

Provident wants this process to be about identifying issues and reso|ving issues that can be put
into some type of legal binding format (addendums, letters of intent). Not about opening up or
renegotiating existing agreements.
Provident offered to fund (up to $40,000) the landowner committee to reimburse members for
their time. The purpose is to clarify la ndowner rights under existing agreements. Not willing to
fund legal fees to contest existing agreements. The landowner committee can decide how the
money is spent.

Dear Ms. Erickson,
RE: Hearing Order OH~02-2011, Provident Energy Pipeline Inc., Propo sed Beatton River
Replacement Proj ect ‘
The following is my Letter of Comment on the Project
My family runs a third generation family farm that derives its income producing grain,
oilseed, pulse and forage seed crops. As members of the Canadian Seed Grower’s
Association we produce various crops for seed, some of which are certiﬁed by meeting
the seed industry standards for quality and purity. A substantial effort and cost is put into
weed control and preventing the introduction of diﬁicult to control weeds which would
devalue the products that we produce. .
V The Pipeline Project crosses on a diagonal the following properties owned by Gordon
Hill: SE 1/4, 16, 83, 17 W of6
NEl/4, 16, 83,17 W of6
NWl/4,15, 83,17 W of6
These properties were purchased by Gordon Hill from the now deceased previous owners
who signed Easement agreements with Trans-Prairie Pipelines Ltd. in 1961. Copies of
these agreements were presented to me in July 2010. A new pipeline was constructed in
February / March 2011 on the old Right of Way without me signing any documentation
with Provident representatives.
Trans-Prajrie Pipelines Ltd. Easement
It would be interesting to know what the original Grantors of these easements would
say if they were here today. They did not know in 1961 about the weed issues producers
have today, four-wheelers that are used to travel across the landowner’s ﬁelds, and soils
that can be left in an unproductive state for many years after construction. The Basement
agreements do not mention the National Energy Board or the control zones that come
with an NEB pipeline. It would be nice if the energy indusuy and regulatory bodies
recognized the rights that contrOl zones take away from landowners There is no mention
of needing a crossing agreement for large equipment. There has been a change of use of

the line and apparently the old line will be abandoned or deconmiissioned some day.
How many Companies have owned this Easement? I can think of at least ﬁve. Would not
good business practice suggest having the Company name on agreements?

Trans-Prairie Pipeline Ltd- paid approximately $100.00 per V2 mile for the
Easement. After ﬁfty years it is the sum of $2.00 per year. Provident has told us they are
- not going pay again for rights they have already paid for. '

Consultation -

I was ﬁrst informed of this Project in July 2010 by Mr Dunn. The ﬁrst meeting was
organized by Mr. Thor Skafte for landowners to meet with Provident representatives. At
a second meeting on September 1,2010 several landowners agreed to form the North
Peace Landowners Committee (NPLC ) under the umbrella of the Canadian Association
of Energy and Pipeline Landowner Associations ( CABPLA ). On September 29, 2010 a
letter was sent to Provident Energy informing them of the formation of NPLC/CAEPLA
and providing contact information. I recognize the difﬁculty in moving to a different
negotiating method but do landownets have this right? Provident’ s actions have
demonstrated an unwillingness to accept an alternative consultative method. Feelings of
distrust and animosity also enter the picture.

I have attended several NPLC meetings, one all day NEB landowner session and an
all day NEB facilitated meeting ( see attached lists of meetings and contacts ). I have not
attended or been invited to any meetings organized by Provident Energy.

A 0011th theme of NPLC meetings has been that membets feel they need help with
negotiating with Provident and that is what their expectations were when the Committee
was formed. The reaction of Provident was to use the threat of legal action and the
application of costs against landowners. This comes after refusing to discuss the old
Easement agreements and abandoning the old pipe( see letters on website ). '

This Proj ect has been a real example of why landowners need the protection of
group negotiating to overcome the divide and conquer system. Having said that, many of
us have ended up with a newly- constructed pipeline without having signed any
agreements that are legally binding on Provident Energy and now may be faced with a
long and costly effon to resolve issms.

The section 58 landowners who still have a chance to negotiate a fair agreement
really need to look at what is happening at their neighbors when they are asked to sign.
Abandoning or Decommissioning the Pipeline

' Why is Provident pretending a complete new pipeline is O&M? We can only
speculate why this is being done. A complete new construction should be called a new
line. Since the old line is to be left in the ground it is not being replaced, but rather
another pipeline is being added to the right of way.

The Trans-Prah'ie Pipeline Easement allows all of the above but the question is:
how are the landowners legally protected from all the issues that were not thought of in
1961 when the agreements were signed. As the history of this right of way shows,
Provident could be gone, the people representing Provident are largely contractors and
will move on leaving only landowners as the constant in the equation.

It is interesting to note that on January 31, 2011 we were given a letter of
notiﬁcation about the removal from the right of way of a Plateau 3” pipeline signed by
Pembina Pipeline Corp. Up to that point we were told that there would be four lines in the
right of way. It also became obvious that old pipes can be removed if the company has
the will to do so. It also begs the question of how many different Companies have an
interest in the right of way that landowners do not know about.

' [received a bound copy of this document January 31, 2011 which states “the
company plans to install replacement pipeline in a new right of way across the lands” and
also the access to the land “from the Effective Date until two (2) years following
completion of construction”. The question is why should a landowner sign this unless
compensated for the rights being taken?
Conclusions
Why can Provident Energy undertake construction on our land without a binding
agreement protecting us from weed issues and having a soil remediation plan that puts the -
land back to its productive ability? In my experience Environmental Plans like the eighty-
seven page one we were presented with on March 1 1,2011 are not binding on anyone.
How can landowners get binding protection from the future hazards of abandoned
pipelines?
Do landowners have the right to large group respectﬁJl negotiations?
What documents can be used that will be legally binding when the company
refuses to discuss Easement agreements and has not provided as yet any alternative ( see
non binding meeting notes ﬁ-om Februaxy 18, 201 l )? _
Does Provident Operate in a 1961 atmosPhere, as they seem to expect landowners
to be in?
I haVe been notiﬁed by Provident that I will be unable to cross the right of way for
seeding this year. Does anyone acknowledge how this affects our ﬁeld operations? ‘
Provident attempted to leave cheques with landowners without any signed
documentation. I have enquired of people in the industry and none were aware of this
practice. Does acceptance of a cheque bind a landowner in any way to Provident Energy?
Thank you,

Dear Sir:
Re: Your letter dated Nov. 22, 2010 that was hand delivered to Colleen Hill on Nov. 24,
2010.
Pipeline Compensation Sheet
1) The sheet I received on AugJO was blank so this is the ﬁrst time 1 have seen
numbm and dollar amounts. Perhaps I didn’t get all the handouts a: the meeting.
2) Since your employees have been on the ROW several times the option S 500
would not be included in the total as stated on option line at the top of the page.
3) I have not had bales on any of the affected ﬁelds for years so am not sure why
this is included in the calculation under crop loss. Bales imply hay is being
produced which is not the case, which will also eliminate the re-seeding cost.
4) Since I have not been informed how the land distm-bance will be dealt with I
cannot agree to your amounts for TWS or N & D.
S) I can guarantee that a lot more than the $1972.42 incentive will be Spent if
problem weeds are introduced to our land. That dollar amount will not ﬁll the
sprayer tank once and lasts less than one hour of spraying time in the ﬁeld.
6) There has not been any amount designated for time spent dealing with your
employees and contractors. The soils people have already been out in the 2010
cr0p to take samples. .
7) There isn’t any mention of the buﬁ'er zones that now comes with an NEB line.
Rights are taken from the landowner and uansfened to Provident and the NEB. I I
place a value on these lights that are taken from our farm. }

As a point of interest our farm produces Pedigreed Seed Crops as well as Forage Seed
Creps. Does Provident Energy have any idea what this means and the affect their project '
may have in increasing our cost of business? The Scentless Chamomile that is out of A
control on Provident’s ROW two properties away ﬁ’om us could potentially limit our
cropping options. We hand pick this weed Where we ﬁnd it on our farm because there are
very few chemicals that control it and they are eXpenSive. As well it is a Primary Noxious
Weed tmdet the BC Weed Control Act.
Exlﬁbit A Conditions:
1) Contacting land-owner. What is the purpose when employees / contractors do as
they please. Two of you: contractors have four—wheeled across our ﬁelds long
! distances from the ROW for no obvious reason. Is Provident prepared to pay for
1 this type of trespass Or is it considered OK under the easement agreements?
l 2) Weed control. Yes all equipment should be cleaned, but in view of A—l (above)
l our risk is substantial. Weeds are not mentioned in the easement agreements so
; are we stuck with whatever Provident leaves behind or will they accept
' responsibility for weed issues for the life of the agreements? I brought this
subject up at the August meeting and have not had a reaponse ﬁom Provident.
3) Pipeline ROW left ready for seeding. I would be more interested in the ROW
being left with the same productive ability as Provident ﬁnds it at present, as our
experience in this axea of limited topsoil is that it takes many years for disturbed
soil to get back to normal. Has Provident contacted soil people with knowledge
about what happens to disturbed soil?
4) It is stated in your letter that you are prepared to use the NEB Arbitration
process to settle issues. If this happens I want Provident’ s committment that
compensation for all Gordon Hill’s and family’s time and legal costs will be
paid as it is a very time consuming process.
5) Abandoning the old pipe. How does Provident propose to not leave the
landowner responsible for the pipe in the future and any costs associated with
this process?
The three 1961 easement ageements I have are with Trans—Prairie Pipelines, Ltd.
The previous landowners are all deceased When these landowners signed in 1961 four
wheelers did not exist, noxious weeds were not much of an issue, the market place did
not demand as perfect a product as today and the NEB was not part of the agreement.
You: letter states Provident is going to enforce these agreements that do not take into
account the changes that have taken place over forty- nine years. We ﬁnd this
unacceptable.

Dear Ms. Erickson:
RE: Hearing Order OH—02-21, Provident Energy Pipeline Inc., Proposed Beanon River
Replacement Project
The following is my letter of comment on the project.
My F amily has been fanning in this area since 1972. We have a mixed farm with cattle,
hay and oats for green feed. We are primarily a cow ca1f0peration with forage crops
grown for feed for our own livestock. The pipeline project crosses the NE %, 15, 83, 17,
W of 6, a quarter of land that we have owned and farmed since 1980.
In the fall of 2010 I received one of many phone calls from Provident representative _
Brian Dunn informing me of construction to begin on my land in the near future. In
November of 2010 I joined CAEPLA and became part of the NPLC. .
After many phone calls to my home and at my place of work a meeting was arranged.
We met in Janualy of 201 1. Mr. Dunn brought with him a bound copy of a damage
release, a bound copy of a temporary workspace agreement and a partially completed
compensation offer sheet-
I made Mr. Dunn aware on a number of occasions that I was a member of the
NPLC/CAEPLA and my wish to negotiate ﬂirough them. This fact did not seem of
relevance to him as he doggedly pursued my signature on these documents. At this
meeting when I told Mr. Dunn that I would not be signing the documents in the near
future, he informed me that the company could be forced to go around my land and I
would incur the costs of such a move. I was somewhat surprised by this statement and
asked him if this had ever happened. He replied he did not think so. I asked Mr. Dunn to
let me have some time to validate and review my oﬁer sheet as I have never dealt with
such agreements in the past. He was in agreement. However, when he called to meet
again he mentioned that if I was delaying due to wanting more compensation than was
sketched out the ﬁrst day it may require going a different route,(ie. arbitration). I feel he
was dishonest in putting forward his oﬂ'er and then saying it was okay to seek outside
assistance to make sure I was not doing myself ﬁnancial or land issue harm.

I did grant Provident verbal permission to enter the land after being asked by Mr. Dunn if
I intended to block the Right Of Way.
I was not given a copy of the original easement agreement made in 1961 until I requested
it in February 201 1. Should this not be given at the ﬁrst meeting?
I joined NPLC/CAPELA because as a landowner With no experience dealing with
pipeline issues, I felt the need of knowledgeable assistance to help me make decisions
with regard to stewardship of the land, the outdated easement agreement and fair
compensation.
I felt intimidated and pressured to sign documents I was unprepared for and had not had a
chance to previously review. I was not willing to sign a damage release for work not yet
begun.
Provident Energy constructed their pipeline on my land during the months of Februaxy
and March of 2011 with no signed documents.
Thank you for your time.

Dear Ms. Erickson:
RE: Hearing Order OH—02-201 1, Provident Energy Pipeline Inc., Proposed Beatton
River Replacement Proj ect
The following is my letter of comment in regard to the proj ect.
The pipeline crosses our land on three quaners:
SE ‘A, 16, 83,17 Wof6
NE %,16, 83,17 W of6
NW%,15, 83,17 W of6
My concerns with the construction of the pipeline are in several areas.
The expectation that landowners should be forced to abide by outdated easement
agreements signed in 1961 by landowners whom, I am sure you would agree, had no idea
of the challenges that would face the landowners of today. There is, as I am sure all are
aware, little protection for the land or the landowners in the Basement Agreements signed
with Trans~Praiﬁe Pipeline in 1961. I would like to think that the unfairness of the
Basement Agreement in regard to landowner protection and potential peril to the land and
its occupants would be recognized by the legislative body, the regulatory boards and
industry. Is it unreasonable to expect industry to work with “all” stakeholders to ensure
the update of old easement agreements to ensure good stewardship of lands affected by
the energy industry?
In this process we continue to reiterate our desire to negotiate as a group. I recognize that
it is a difﬁcult challenge to change ways of thinking in regard to landowner-energy
industry one-on-one negotiations. We have reached a time when the people who are
most impacted by the energy industxy are trying to ﬁnd a new method of dealing with
some very complex issues. I feel that Provident Energy has demonstrated an
unwillingness to open a meaningful dialogue with NPLC/CAEPLA. This resistance to
engage in meaningﬁil negotiation in regard to legally binding protection along the Right

been resolved. These issues, among others, remain outstanding!

bur land is situated on the part of the pipeline that will be abandoned once this new portion is
ﬁnished- Our experiences with vaident during this whole Project has prompted us to add our
:Voice to those of the Landowners of the new section. We suggest it is imperative for the NEB to
insist that Provident negotiate a full agreement, with signatures, with the Landowners on the new
portion before construction of the new portion can go ahead- The following reasons suppon our
position.
We have been involved with the process for this new line since we found out about it from our
heighbours. Not once has Provident ever come to our door to inform us of this change in line
image, nor have they sent any information except the notices for the hearing order and the request
for the conﬁdentiality of the supplementary geotechnical evaluation report.
Such actions create instant concern in us, due to the fact that Provident has not fulﬁlled their duty
to inform everyone along the affected pipeline of the work they are doing. Why not? Why this
disreSpect?
Added to this, we have experienced along with the other Landowners how Provident has been
uncooperative with CAEPLA until forced to work with them this spring. Even then, to call a 50
year—old agreement a legal one without updating it to modern standards tells of appalling
disrespect by the company for the landowner and the environmental impact of their work.

lYou will also hear by affected Landowners, of Provident's disregard for their EPP while they
lworked on the replacement portions this winter. It is very obvious that without legally binding
ldocuments, Provident is careless of their commitments to the environment, to weed control, and
lto safe depth of coverage so farming can occur without restrictions of vehicle size/weight. Such
ithings are unacceptable by today's standards.
lNote here that is a travesty to the Landowners that the NEB has such out-dated legislation that
bllows Provident to build a new pipeline on a 50 year-old agreement, and not need to re-
[hiegoﬁate it, or bring the agreement up to today's compensation and environmental standards.
’1" his also is unacceptable, and we ask that this matter be addressed intuiediately by the Board.
1 Pipelines are a necessary part of our economy today, but that does not mean the Landowner
heeds to be as disregarded as he/she is. The potential impact on our enviromnent due to
i’rovident's proven disregard for even their EPP is a very serious issue. We have not seen this
EPP offered as an attachment to a legal agreement for the Landowners on the new pipeline,
lwhich means that Provident does not intend to make themselves legally bound to it. Without the
bpportunity by the Landowners to insist on such environmental protection through negotiations
lBEFORE the pipeline is built, there is little likelihood that Provident will commit to any such
tarotection after. This is especially important now, since Mortgage companies do not give loans
or property that has environmental hazards on it. Pipelines are environmental risks, and it needs
lo be clear in the contract that the Pipeline owner will be responsible for ALL such problems at
lall times. Such things cannot be negotiated aﬁera pipeline is installed without extreme difﬁculty
by the Landowner.
l As to socio-economic effects - Landowners have been without respectful compensation for the
i156 of their lands for pipelines for far too long. The NEB must become involved in this part of
the Pipeline issues as well, since without such compensation the Landowner is left with nothing
but hassle and loss of value of his land. As seen in this process, everyone but the Landowner
feets paid every time there is an action taken. This leaves the Landowner victimized, and without
. spectful compensation of the pipeline on an ongoing basis, this victimization will continue.
? As the NEB is supposed to be a fair advocate of all parties involved, this issue must become
fart of your mandate. It is not right that a Landowner must ﬁght in so many different 'couits‘ for
heir full rights.
We have some ﬁirther questions: If the application for the new portion doesn‘t get approved,
ean Provident automatically put the new line in on the old portion, without a hearing? The 40
hm ruling of the replacement says there needs to be one- There are deep concerns with
l’rovident’s integrity in following what they say they will do, after watching them replace the
hoxth and south ends of this line. The Landowner MUST have a say in what goes on on his land.
The escape route for our area of the pipeline is unacceptable, (the Harmon RD), as 3 km of it is
snowed in in the winter, and is impassable in the summer when it rains. We would ask that

Provident provide an updated escape plan that uses roads open all year. Since this line is so old,
Isuch an escape route becomes more important.

- Regarding abandonment of the old line: We have been told that this line will not be abandoned
iuntil the new line also gets abandoned. That can be in another 50 yearsll ! This disregards
ltoday's environmental stewardship practises, and again it leaves the landowner with a huge
hiability when trying to sell his property. Particularly in our case, where no pipeline will exist at
iall, this is unacceptable. We would ask that as a requirement for the new line to be built, that the

, ' nion of pipeline along Franz and Maya Wenger's and Gerald Harmon's land, which will be

1y abandoned, must be removed along with all caveats against it-

Provident Energy Pipeline Inc.

2100, 250 - 2"d Street SW

Calgary, AB T2P 0C1

Dear Mr. Santos,

Re: Provident Energy Pipeline Inc’s (Provident Energy} proposed Beatton River pipeline replacement
project

As Director of Federally Regulated Projects for the Canadian Association of Energy and Pipeline
Landowner Associations (CAEPLA), l have been directed to inform you that six members of the North
Peace Landowners Committee (NPLC) directly affected by the Section 58.1 Beatton River Replacement
Project are forwa rding their list of legitimate concerns respecting safety, ris k, lia bility, environmental,
construction and socio-economic issues.

The following is the list of issues that landowners have not been consulted on and wish to negotiate
resolution to:

0 Depth of Cover — Landowners are concerned that depth of cover over both existing and new
pipelines be sufficient to accommodate modern agricultural cultivation practices and farm
machinery, and to reduce potential for third party impact and damages which may result there
from. Provident Energy's proposed pipelines should be installed at a depth of cover no less than
five (5) feet.

0 Risk Assessment/Pipe Thickness - Landowners need to be satisfied that appropriate risk
assessment has been completed, identifying and quantifying potential risks and outcomes so
that appropriate design specifications are incorporated into the planning process to minimize
risks to landowners, theirfamilies, and communities. This issue is of particular concern because
of the product to be transported through the preposed pipeline.

O Indemnity - Landowners require provision in their easement agreements that Provident Energy
indemnify them with respect to any claims arising from Provident Energy’s pipeline operations.
Landowners also want Provident Energy to provide assurances with respect to adequate liability
insurance coverage covering construction and operation ofthe pipeline, both for Provident

5 Energy and its contractors, as well as detailed analytical information on the products being
transported in the pipelines through their properties.
:—

2. 7 Open Trench
Enbridge will use reasonable commercial efforts to limit the length of time that
any one section of production trench is open to two weeks.

. 2.8 Grading

0n present and proposed agricultural lands, Enbridge will restore soils to pre-
construction grade as reasonably practicable.

2.9 Construction Vehicle Traiﬁc
Whenever possible. all vehicles and equipment will travel on the easement and
temporary work space areas.

2.10 Coverage Over Pipeline

Enbridge will install the new LSr and Alberta Clipper pipelines with a minimum of

.9 metres of coverage from the top of the pipe to construction grade (and prior to

replacement of the topsoil).

The company hereby grants permission to the landowner to cross the LSr,

Alberta Clipper and all existing pipelines at any time with all agricultural

equipment to carry out cultivation of the lands except as provided in Appendix "B"

attached hereto (which Appendix may be amended by Enbridge from time to time

in which case the revised Appendix will take effect upon confirmed receipt by the
landowner). If at any time, Enbridge determines that the landowner cannot cross
any pipeline or pipelines with all agricultural equipment Enbridge shall:

(3) specify to the landowner the restricted equipment or practice;

(b) where applicable. implement mitigative measures so as to ensure the
safe crossing of the landowner’s farming equipment and practices over
the pipeline(s); or

(c) with respect to cultivated lands and with the la ndowner's agreement, pay
compensation for any resulting crop loss or other direct damages.

Notwithstanding any permission granted in this section 2.10, Enbridge shall not

be liable for any damages, claims. suits or actions resulting from the gross

negligence or wilful misconduct of the landowner.
2.11 Stone-picking

Enbridge will pick stones in accordance with the ESA and the Environmental

Guidelines for Constmction. In particular Enbridge will:

(a) Remove stones from disturbed soil to achieve equivalence with the
surrounding subsoil! topsoil as well as stones from the upper 30 cm of
ditch and grade spoil that will interfere with topsoil replacement or
cultivation (i.e. stones larger than 10 cm in diameter);

6

(b) Monitor the right-of-way during operations for presence of stones at the

surface and remediate if stoniness interferes with agricultural practices.
3. INTEGRITY OF OTHER PRIVATE PROPERTY AND SERVICES
3.1 Enbn'dge will ensure: '

(a) reasonable passage and land access for agricultural equipment during
construction;

(b) that if private water or utility lines are planned to be interrupted. Enbridge
will supply temporary service to the affected landowners prior to service
interruption. (In the event of accidental interruption, temporary services
will be provided by Enbridge at the earliest possible opportunity);

(c) that temporary gates will be installed at fence mossings, and temporary
fences will be installed surrounding trench areas where livestock is kept,
in order to prevent entry onto the easement and tem porary working areas
While construction is ongoing. During construction, Enbridge agrees to
provide temporary water to livestock where temporary fencing has cut off
the normal supply of water;

(d) that any fences which are damaged by pipeline construction are repaired
or replaced by Enbrldge in a good and workmanlike manner;

(e) that any survey monuments which are removed or destroyed during
pipeline construction are replaced; and

(f) that a copy of this AGREEMENT, any relevant environmental reports and
any orders or conditions upon which regulatory approvals were granted to
Enbridge is provided to the construction contractor.

3.2 Drainage

Enbridge will repair, restore and maintain all drainage system functionality to as-

found condition. This work shall be completed consistent with Enbridge’s

Environmental Guidelines for Construction as set out below. The Construction

Line List will be used to identify landowner requirements and will serve as the

basis for construction activities. Enbridge will provide the landowner with a copy

of the as-built drainage plans speciﬁc to the repaired or restored areas.

Enbridge will cooperate with the Iandholder to accommodate planned drainage

systems to the extent that plans are affected by the existence of the Enbridge

pipelines. With prior approval, Enbridge will reimburse the landowner for any
reasonable extra costs incurred due to the presence of the pipeline(s). Any
proposed cost-sharing must be identiﬁed and approved by Enbridge prior to the
tile installation.

Environmental Guidelines for Construction:

(i) Trenching - under Drain Tiles
7

Enbridge will excavate the trench so that the pipeline may be laid
over or under the tile with a minimum clearance of 30 cm (12 in.).
if drain tiles are cut during trenching Enbridge will:
. identify the location of the damaged tile at the trench and
at bothsides of the construction ROW;
- install a temporary ﬂume if needed to maintain drainage;
. cap the ends to prevent clogging drains with dirt or debris;
. keep plugs in place until the damaged tile is repaired
(ii) Backﬁlling - under Drain Tiles
Before backfilling, Enbridge will determine whether any drain tiles
crossed during trenching were damaged during construction.
Enbridge will use a sewer rod or pipe snake to probe open ends of
tiles and will repair any damaged tiles by inserting a competent
support (e.g.. length of solid pipe) around the tile to prevent
settling. If damage is extensive, broken tile will be removed and
replace with new tile.
Drain tiles damaged during construction must be repaired to their
preconstruction condition or better.
Enbridge will backﬁll around drain tiles in lifts and compact each
lift.
3.3 Water Wells
Should a registered or known (and identiﬁed on the Construction Line List) water
well within 30 metres of ROW be damaged (diminishment in quantity andlor
quality) from pipeline installationloperations, a potable water supply will be
provided to the landowner and the water well shall be restored or replaced at
Enbridge‘s expense as may be required.
4.‘ COMPENSATION FOR LAND USE ANDIOR DAMAGES
4.1 Easement compensation and temporary land use compensation
Land rights required for the pipeline construction include permanent interests
acquired by way of the pipeline easement (in those cases where Enbridge does
not already own sufﬁcient existing easement to construct the new pipeline(s))
and temporary workspace agreements. Where Enbridge has sufficient existing
permanent easement to install the new pipeline(s), it will pay the landowner a
temporary workspace payment based on the entire area required for
construction. Enbridge will compensate landowners for permanent easement
and temporary workspace as set out in Schedule 3 attached. Site-speciﬁc land
rights compensation for non-agricultural land (including gravel pits) and
compensation in respect of any above ground installation will be reviewed and
negotiated separately.
. 8

4.2 Damage compensation categories

(a) Damages will be paid to owners of cultivated lands in relation to:

(i) all claims of any nature whatsoever suffered by the landowner to
the date hereof as a result of the operations of Enbridge and/or its
agents or contractors in operating and maintaining it pipelines
across the lands of the landowner except those claims that have
been communicated to Enbridge as of October 1. 2007; .

(ii) the loss of use of the lands, including all crop loss prior to and for
the ﬁrst six years (or seven years if construction is conducted over
2 growing seasons on a landowners lands) to commence in the
year of construction of the pipeline and for ﬁve years thereafter;

(iii) disturbance (including nuisance, noise and inconvenience such as
lost time due to negotiations and construction, interference to
farming operations, restricted headlands, interrupted access
(severance), extra applications of fertilizer, or temporary storage
of topsoil off easement, etc.), and

(iv) all other loss and damage of any nature or kind whatsoever as a
result of the construction of the pipeline(s), (with the exception of
personal injury and damage to personal property)

(collectively referred to as “Damages”)

(b) Enbridge will, on a without prejudice basis, make an Upfront lump sum
payment as set out in Schedule 3, calculated based upon the area of the
permanent easement and/or temporary workspace used. to settle all
Damages on cultivated lands (the “Damage Settlement”). Payment is
normally made after construction but will be made to the landowner within
90 days of the delivery of executed agreements (including as applicable,
easement agreements, temporary workspace agreements, consents and
such other documentation as necessary or desirable in relation to the
Projects) and signed releases from individual landowners to Enbridge
which will:

(i) give Enbridge a full and ﬁnal release on Damages. and
(ii) include an indemniﬁcation for related parties' claims for losses
compensated for as part of the Damage Settlement.

(c) Current pipeline construction techniques are intended to minimize
damages to soil and crop productivity. The Damage Settlement includes
an allowance for any past crop losses (except those claims that have

I been communicated to Enbridge as of October 1, 2007) and possible '
future crop losses (or other loss of use) for the ﬁrst six years (or seven
years if construction is conducted over 2 growing seasons on a
landowners lands). but is not an acknowledgement that such damage
9

occurred or is expected. Conversely. Enbridge's soil handling programs
are intended to demonstrate the Company's commitment to soil
conservation and Enbridge believes that using these techniques. minimal
crop losses are likely to occur.

(d) Rights to subsequent crop loss, if any. shall be determined pursuant to
the provisions of the applicable easement agreement and section 7.1
hereof.

(e) For any land used outside the permanent easemenﬂs) or temporary
workspace. Enbridge will pay additional temporary work space
compensation and will pay damages for future crop loss, if any, on an “as
incurred” basis.

4.3 Non-Renewabie Resources and Specialty Cmps

Damages to commercially extractable non-renewable resources contained withih

the acquired permanent easement, (such as gravel and sand), specialty crops

(such as lentils, registered seed variety, peas, potatoes), irrigation lands and

non-cultivated lands will be reviewed and compensation negotiated on a site

speciﬁc basis.
4.4 Trapped Land

As set out in Schedule "“3, Enbridge agrees to pay landowners 100 % damages

for crop losses for cultivated lands which Enbridge and the landowner agree are

rendered not useable during the construction of the pipeline(s) and clean up
following construction.
4.5 Signing Bonus

Where the landowner executes and delivers to Enbridge the agreements

(including, as applicable, easement agreement, temporary workspace

agreement, consent and other such documentation necessary or desirable in

relation to the Projects) on or before December 315‘ 2007, the Company will

provide an early signing bonus as set out in Schedule 3.

the landowners’ lands for the purposes of conducting environmental and
' other su rveys;
(b) will not participate in the public hearing process for the Projects or oppose
the route of the pipeline(s) or the methods or timing of construction. a
If, however, landowner is entitled to site-speciﬁc compensation as contemplated
in sections 4.1 and 4.3 hereof, landowner reserves the right to arbitrate the
amount of compensation to which he/she is entitled but acknowledges that failure
to execute and deliver the easement agreement, temporary workspace
agreement, or consent (as the case may be) to Enbridge on or before December
31, 2007 will forfeit landowner’s entitlement to a signing bonus.
POST-CONSTRUCTION AND PIPELINE OPERATIONS |§SUES
6. WEED C0 NTROL
6. 1 Weed control
Enbridge will work with each landowner to ensure that weeds are controlled
along the pipeline during pipeline construction. A weed survey of all lands
traversed by the route will be conducted prior to construction to determine the
presence of weeds. The survey wiil identify any site~speciﬁc mitigative measures
to prevent the spread of weeds from areas of infestation to adjacent lands.
Schedule 4 attached, provides additional information on Enbridge's weed
management measures.
7. TOPSOIL
7.1 Topsoil Replacement
If there is greater than 50% crop loss after three years, Enbridge will retain an
independent soils consultant satisfactory to both parties to develop a prescription
to rectify the problem. This may include the importation of topsoil or other
restorative techniques. if topsoil is imported it will be of a quality consistent with
the soils adjacent to the work area and from a source approved by the
landowner, dry and free of noxious weeds;
11

7.2 Contamination
Where contamination is encountered on the ROW during construction, Enbridge
shall implement the Contaminated Soil Contingency Procedure in the ESA, and
retain an independent consultant to carry out tests to assess and prescribe
remediation for soils contaminated as a resuit of Enbridge's operations. Enbridge

\

| .

0 Future Use — Landowners require that these pipelines be constructed to minimise interference
with the future use of their lands, and that Provident Energy be responsible for any costs
incurred in relation to changes in use attributable to the existence of this pipeline corridor.

0 Soil Management - There is proven soil and drainage disturbance and damage during
construction of pipelines that result in continuing production losses. Landowners are very
conce rned that appropriate construction methodology and restoration measures are
implemented to minimize damage to virgin and vulnerable soils. Landowners require an
effective dispute resolution system for the resolution of construction issues. To that effect, they
require that an independent construction monitor be appointed to ensure that Provident
Energy’s commitments to landowners are fulfilled, and to assist a joint committee consisting of

' Provident Energy and landowner representatives to resolve issues which arise during
construction.

0 Protection against Soil Contamination - Landowners require Provident Energy to ensure that
their lands will be protected against the importation of and contamination by disease, weeds,
and other contaminants as a result ofthe construction and operation of the pipelines. Provident
Energy must develop and employ an effective prevention and protection protocol where the
potential for contamination exists. The eﬂegtive grevention and grotection protocol will
include the Battleford Trail Groug ‘Club Root Protocol'. and as such there will be no entry
granted to any contractor or surveyor on a NPLC member’s land until such time as CAEPLA
diregs.

0 Water source Protection - Provident Energy must ensure that groundwater sou rces for human
and livestock consumption and for irrigation are protected during construction and operation of
the pipeline. Where it is possible that such sources may be affected by construction or
operational practices, quantitative and qualitative testing must be performed before and after,
and where the water source is affected, Provident Energy must establish an alternative source
to the satisfaction of the landowner.

0 Wet Soil Shutdown - Should Provident Energy be intending to work in wet soil conditions,
landowners require that they be consulted with respect to the nature and extent of the work to
be undertaken (with access to independent consultant advice), and that project planning include
provision for all technically feasible construction methods to minimize soil damage. In addition,
landowners require that proposed compensation include provision for increased losses which
la ndowners will inevitably suffer if work proceeds in wet soil conditions.

0 Construction Access - Landowners require that the length of open trench be restricted during
construction and that reasonable provision be made to limit interference with their access to
agricultural lands.

SCHEDULE 4
WEED MANAGEMENT

Criteria for Implementation:

Management of invasive plant species is of paramount concern to Enbridge. The goal of

invasive species management for the LS: pipeline component of the Southern Lights Project

and the Alberta Clipper Project is to prevent the introduction and Spread of non-native plants
and to eliminate or control them. as practical within the project area. To help achieve this goal.
the following measures will be implemented during construction and restoration.

1. All equipment shall arrive for work in a clean condition to minimize the risk of weed
introduction. Any equipment which arrives in a dirty condition will not be allowed to work
until it has been cleaned off at a suitable location.

2. Equipment passing through areas identified as having a weed problem will be cleaned
thorougth with all soil and debris removed prior to continuing work on the light~of-way.

3. Weed growth will be monitored and controlled on a routine basis (at least twice during a
growing season) on areas where ﬁnal clean-up and tcpsoil replacement is postponed
until the Alberta Clipper Project is completed.

4. Control the growth of noxious or nuisance weeds on topsoil storage piles by hand
cultivating, mowing or if necessary using selective. nonpersistent herbicides. Control will
be initiated before weedy species mature (i.e., produce seed).

5. Weed growth will be frequently monitored during restoration activities, and weed control
measures applied on a site-speciﬁc basis.

6. The LSr and Alberta Clipper pipeline construction right~of~way will be monitored for
weed infestations as a part of the post—construction monitoring program.

7. Areas of poor plant cover will be reseeded and weed control measures will be applied if
warranted.

8. All equipment cleaning station locations along the proposed route will be assessed in
late spring. Weed species of concern that are identiﬁed at the sites will be treated.
Manual removal of plants or chemical treatment will occur. If weeds are manually
removed when in ﬂower, the weed material will be disposed of in an approved land-ﬁll
facility.

9. Record all weed treatment and monitoring. Provide records of weed control measures to
the Joint Committee and weed treatment to the Landowner for any treatment on his/her
lands.

Notes:

1. Prior to construction, pull out or mow problem weed species from heavily infested areas
and dispose of as directed by the Environmental Inspector.

0 Land Rights Compensation -With the creation ofthis utility corridor, landowners require that
compensation paid in advance of construction reflect not only the agricultural market value of '
this Ia nd, but the intensification of its use and an annual payment renegotiated every five (5) i
years to address the diminishment of the value of remaining la nds both for more intensive
agricultural use and other development. Landowners also require a ditching fee, based on a
negotiated rate charge per meter.

0 Wood Lot Restoration and Compensation - La ndowners are similarly concerned that

i compensation paid in advance of construction, include provision for trees which will be
damaged or destroyed reflecting aesthetic and commercial value, and that satisfactory provision
be made for replacement and maintenance of equivalent trees.

0 Site Specific Construction Issues — Provident Energy must arrange with individual landowners in
advance of construction, to the extent it is possible to do so, to address site specific works,
damages, and compensation issues. Where these issues cannot be dealt with adequately in
advance, Provident Energy must ensure that landowners can have these issues addressed during
the construction process.

0 Disturbance Damages - Landowners are concerned that the utility corridor to be created by
Provident Energy’s proposed pipeline construction will result in increased, ongoing interference
in the conduct of their agricultural operations, and diminishment in the quality of life for them
and their families (including anxiety, stress, inconvenience, and the cost for landowners during
construction and operation of the pipeline). They require that compensation paid in advance of
construction, and as an annual payment recognize these impacts, both during construction and
forever thereafter during the operation of the pipeline.

0 Crop Loss Compensation - Landowners require compensation in advance of construction which
recognizes the production losses they will suffer on both easement and temporary use lands
during construction, and an annual payment for all future losses. This compensation must
include provision renegotiation to address the issues of anticipated future increases in prices
and productivity.

0 Control Zone.

0 Future Loss - Following construction and during the operation ofthe pipeline, landowners
require annual compensation, subject to periodic review, to address future land value,
disturbance, and production impacts.

0 Maintenance & Repairs — Landowners are concerned about maintenance and repair operations
conducted by Provident Energy on their lands with respect to the pipeline as it ages, and require
that an ancillary agreement be developed to cover such operations which includes provision for
scheduling of such activities; construction methods and restoration measures to be

WEED MANAGEMENT

2. Salvage topsoil from the full width of the construction right-of-way in areas of heavy
weed infestations, as directed by the Environmental Inspector. Store topsoil from the
affected area separately.

3. Clean all topsoil handling equipment once past the area. Clean equipment at designated
weed ctean-oﬁ stations during nonfrozen conditions with shovels, compressed air. or
high-pressure water. as directed by the Environmental Inspector.

4. Record infestation areas and monitor during post-construction monitoring. Provide copy
of records to Joint Committee.

5. Record location of clean-off site for future monitoring and, if warranted. weed control.

TYPICAL WEED CLEAN-OFF STATION — AIR
Criteria for lm plementation:
Weed clean—off stations using compressed air and manual track cleaning for cleaning soil from
construction equipment, may be set up where track cleaning by hand and other weed control
measures are determined to be insufﬁcient. Clean-off station locations will be established at
locations identified on the Environmental Alignment Sheets and as determined by the
Environmental Inspector prior to commencement of construction in the area. Clean-off
requirements will apply to all construction equipment involved in topsoil handling operations.
Dry cleaning stations using high pressure compressed air for cleaning soil from construction
equipment will be established along the proposed route at strategic locations to manage weed
concerns. Clean-off requirements will apply to all construction equipment involved in topsoil
handling operations. The diagram below is an example of how a dry cleaning station may be
! constructed. Final design should be determined by the Chief Inspector, in consultation with the

SCHEDULE 5
INTEGRITY DIG POLICY AND PROCEDURES 0N PRIVATE LANDS
INVESTIGATIVE DIG PROCESS F OR LANDOWNERS
Enbridge Pipelines lnc. (Enbridge) is a world leader in pipeline design, construction, safety and
reliability. In order to maintain the integrity of our system, Bnbridge utilizes state of the art technology
to identify potential pipeline anomalies.
Enbridge periodically uses specialized internal inspection devices called “Smart Pigs” that travel
through its pipelines collecting data. The data is then analyzed to determine if there are areas of
concern requiring further investigation. If any anomalies are detected, this section of the pipeline is
excavated and the pipeline is examined to determine if repairs are required.
Enbridge is committed to responsible behaviour while completing required maintenance work on your
property. We meet this commitment by:
0 Ensuring landowners are treated fairly and consistently and compensated for certain impacts
that may occur;
0 Identifying any special considerations you may have in advance of the work and responding
accordingly;
0 Planning the work in a manner that minimizes the level of inconvenience to you;
0 Maintaining contact with you throughout the process to ensure concerns are addressed and so
that you are aware of how the work is proceeding;
0 Ensuring safety in every aspect of the maintenance work while it is performed;
1» Respecting the environment by complying with regulatory requirements and Company
Environmental Policies and Procedures.
LANDOWNER CONTACT/PRELIMINARY FIELD RIGHT OF WAY REPORT
When work on the pipeline is required on your land, an Enbridge representative will make reasonable
efforts to contact you a minimum of 7 days in advance of any work being conducted. At this time, an
Enbridge representative will arrange for [and access and provide estimated compensation, preferred
timing of the work, any environmental or safety considerations, and address any other questions or
concerns you may have. The Enbridge representative will complete a Preliminary Field Right-of-Way
Report (attached as Schedule 1 hereto) documenting issues discussed with you. You will have the
option to receive any estimated compensation in advance of the work. The Enbridge Land Agent will
also discuss whether you wish to have periodic up—dates and advise as to how you can reach an i
Enbridge Representative should the need arise. :
I

ﬂ}
1/?
éﬁmsnmc:
In agricultural areas, Enbridge will make reasonable attempts to schedule work activities in a manner
that minimizes interference with agricultural operations. Enbridge prefers to access its dig sites in a
manner that minimizes disturbance to your craps. Enbridge also prefers to conduct the work from
April to December. If Enbridge activity extends outside of this window, you are entitled to receive
' compensation in accordance with the Compensation Section of this document. If temporary workspace
or access is required, Enbridge will discuss and make arrangements with you in advance of
commencing the work and compensate you in accordance with the Preliminary Field Right of Way
Report.
Landowner acknowledges that Enbridge has the right under it existing easements to access the right-of-
way across the easement lands at any time and to access the right-of way across other lands in an
emergency for the purpose of maintaining its pipelines and facilities. Nothing in this Integrity Dig
Procedure limits Enbridge’s rights under the Basement Agreement.
In an emergency situation, in situations where pipeline anomalies require immediate attention or where
work has been scheduled to proceed, Enbridge will attempt to contact the landowner/tenant. However
if you cannot be contacted, access and work will proceed in order to minimize potential hazards to you,
the public and the environment and to maintain scheduled maintenance and dig activities.
EXCAVATION I POST EXCAVATION
Access routes, livestock and fencin g concerns are addressed with the landowner, prior to commencing
work. The access route to dig sites is typically not stripped of topsoil unless requested by the
landowner. Where the Landowner, acting reasonably, requests tepsoil stripping of the access route to
the dig site, and such stripping is possible, the access area shall be stripped to allow equipment to
travel on subsoil. The topsoil will be stored adjacent to the access road. Bnbridge representatives will
stake out the location of the excavation, the pipelines and the access route depending on the length and
location.
Except in the case of an emergency situation requiring immediate action, Enbridge shall follow its
Wet/ Thawing Soils Procedure 02-16 in the Environmental Guidelines for Construction as ﬁled with
the National Energy Board.
The area of the excavation is then stripped of topsoil, which is stored separately from the sub-soil.
Once the pipeline is excavated, the pipe coating is removed, the pipe is cleaned via abrasive blasting
and the pipeline anomaly is inspected. Once inspected, the pipe may need to be repaired either by
removing and replacing that portion of the pipe or by installing a sleeve over the damaged portion of
the pipe to restore its integrity. The abrasive blast media and pipe coating Will be collected, removed
and properly disposed of in accordance with regulatory requirements-
During the dig, if Enbridge determines that additional space and/or temporary work space is needed off
of the right-of-way Enbridge shall make reasonable attempts to notify the Landowner for consent prior
to expanding the workspace and shall compensate the landowner for such lands in accordance with the
base compensation values contained in the Preliminary Field Right of Way Report.

Enbridge will repair, restore and maintain all drainage system functionality to as-found condition. This
work shall be completed consistent with the criteria as set out below. Drainage is maintained as
required for the duration of the work.
(i) Excavating - under Drain Tiles
If drain tiles are cut during excavation Enbridge will:
. identify the location of the damaged tile;
- install a temporary ﬂume if needed to maintain drainage;
- cap the ends to prevent clogging drains with dirt or debris;
- keep plugs in place until the damaged tile is repaired
(ii) Backﬁlling - under Drain Tiles
Before backﬁlling, Enbridge will determine whether any drain tiles crossed
during excavation were damaged during the work. Enbridge will use a sewer
rod or pipe snake to probe open ends of tiles and will repair any damaged tiles
by inserting a competent support (e.g., length of solid pipe) around the tile to
prevent settling. If damage is extensive, broken tile will be removed and replace
with new tile.
Drain tiles damaged during the work must be repaired to their pre—work
condition or better.
Enbridge will backﬁll around drain tiles in lifts and compact each liﬁ.
Once the pipeline is repaired, the pipe’s coating is replaced and the excavation is backﬁlled and
compacted and the topsoil is replaced and the site is returned to its original grade. Where required
Enbridge will chisel plow and/or disc the area of excavation and the access road, or alternatively,
where requested Enbridge will provide reasonable compensation to the landowner to perform such
work.
The site is monitored for subsidence for approximately 1 year after completion of the excavation
I project with additional remediation performed if required. If following return to grade, there is
subsidence in excess of 2-inches, Enbridge shall, in consultation with the landowner, restore the
affected area to grade by re-stripping topsoil and re-grading the subsoils or by applying other
restorative techniques. In certain localized areas, importation of topsoil may be undertaken. If the
work causes a restriction of the natural ﬂow of water due to too much or not enough subsidence,
Bnbridge will restore to pre-work contours and drainage.
Enbridge will remove stones to achieve equivalence with the surrounding subsoil/ topsoil as well as
stones from the upper 30 cm of soil that will interfere with topsoil replacement or cultivation (i.e.
stones larger than 10 cm in diameter).
All stakes are removed and any fences that were opened to facilitate access are repaired or replaced. |
Enbridge will work to avoid tree removal off the right-o f-way to the extent practical if requested by the !
Landowner. Should it be necessary to remove a tree or trees off the right-of—way in order to perform

éﬂhsnmce

the work, and at the request of the Landowner, Enbridge will plant replacement trees on a 1:1 ratio in
areas outside the pipeline easement satisfactory to the landowner.
Enbridge and its contractors use different equipment to expose, investigate, repair and restore the soil
in the disturbed areas. These include: excavators, dozers, an abrasive blasting truck, a coating truck,
pick-up trucks, Gators / alléterrain vehicles, and compactors.
Depending on the time of year when the work is completed spring cleanup may be required. An
Enbridge representative will discuss this with you.
COMPENSATION
Enbridge possesses the right to maintain its pipelines and facilities in accordance with the easement
agreement. Enbridge however is responsible to the landowner for damages resulting from the work
conducted. Enbridge will compensate you for damage in accordance with the terms of the easement
agreement registered on the title to your land and where applicable, the National Energy Board Act.
These damages generally include damages to any crops, tile drains, fences, timber, culverts, bridges
and lanes. In addition, Enbridge will compensate for any additional land rights required to facilitate
the work and any inconvenience suffered. Compensation for any dig site will be based upon a
minimum of one halfacre of disturbance per site.
Payments will vary accordin g to the fair market value of the crop loss incurred, the area of damage and
any inconvenience to you. Estimated damages for planned maintenance activities will be documented
on the Preliminary Field Right-of-Way Report prior to work proceeding. Normally payments are made
upon completion of work when damages can be properly assessed, however, you will have the Option
of receiving these estimated damages prior to Enbridge conducting its work. Upon completion of the
work, an Enbridge representative will make reasonable efforts to contact you within 60 days. If
additional damages were incurred, compensation will be provided to you.

If Enbridge activity is conducted between January and March, Enbridge will pay to the landowner
‘ 150% of the base crop loss and base disturbance damages payable in accordance with the Preliminary
| Field Right of Way Report.

Damages to specialty corps (i.e. produce, registered seed variety, potatoes) shall be reviewed and I
compensated by Enbridge on a site speciﬁc basis. Damages to non-annual crops such as alfalfa or |
pasture shall be negotiated for total losses and shall be restored to production. lf Enbridge and the I
landowner cannot agree on the compensation to be paid for a specialty crop or non-annual crop, such
compensation shall be determined by a jointly retained, independent and qualiﬁed consultant
satisfactory to both parties. If Enbridge’s offer of compensation for a specialty crap or non-annual
crop is at least 5% lower than the ﬁndings of the consultant, Enbridge will agree to pay the full
expense of the consultant.

Enbridge will endeavor to complete each dig within 45 days of commencing the work. Should this not

occur, you are entitled to receive additional compensation due to the increased inconvenience of 150%

of the base crop loss and base disturbance damages payable in accordance with the Preliminary Field

Right of Way Report. In wet weather conditions and in recognition of Enbridge’s wet soils shut down

provisions, additional work time may be required. If such conditions are encountered, the time to
complete shall be extended by the length of time that the conditions exist. Where dig activities are
undertaken by Enbridge in wet soil conditions and top soil has not been stripped, Enbridge will pay to
the landowner compensation of 150% of the base crop loss and base disturbance damages payable in
accordance with the Preliminary F ield Right of Way Report.
The landowner is asked to acknowledge completion of work, and any compensation by signing a
standard receipt and release form. The release is Speciﬁc to the work conducted and addresses damages
up to the date of signature. If there are any subsequent problems associated with the work, Enhridge
remains responsible to rectify the problems.
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
Protecting the environment, compliance with regulatory requirements and maintaining good landowner
relations are of primary importance to Enbridge. Careﬁtl and effective planning ensures compliance
with environmental regulations, public and landowner concerns are addressed and potential adverse
impacts are identiﬁed.
All dig sites are assessed to determine if there are any environmental issues or restrictions. Work
. within environmentally sensitive areas must be planned on a site-specific basis and special mitigating
measures taken to minimize potential impacts. Enbridge will ensure that all necessary licenses, permits
and approvals are in place prior to commencing work.
Tog Soil Strigging
0n cultivated lands, Enbridge will typically strip toil soil from the excavation area and the area
where subsoil is stored. Enbridge will maintain a separation between the topsoil and the adjacent
subsoil pile. This separation will be maintained throughout the course of the work in order to
minimize the potential for mixing of subsoil and topsoil. Enbridge will also work with the
landowner to determine the area stripped and the stripping depth.
Wet Soils Shut Down
Enbridge’s environmental management practices include a review of soil conditions prior to work .
commencing. If the Enbridge representative determines that planned activities will have an I
adverse affect on the soils, alternative activities will be conducted or other mitigating measures
implemented in order to minimize and avoid any adverse affects on the soils. in an emergency
situation where work is required under wet soil conditions, Enbridge will, endeavour to minimize
impacts by restricting activity to the narrowest possible area, utilize Wide track or low ground
pressure equipment, undertake full topsoil stripping if soil conditions permit and pump standing
water to a vegetated area away from streams or ponds (or as agreed upon with the landowner).
Weed Control
Enbridge will work with the landowner to ensure that weeds are controlled on any areas affected by
dig activities includin g the identiﬁcation and implementation of site speciﬁc mitigative measures to
5

O
implemented with respect to access, temporary use and dig site lands; minimum land rights,
disturbance and crop loss compensation to be paid in advance; and, provision for increased
compensation where these operations are carried out in wet soil conditions.
I include a copy of the recently negotiated MPLA/SAPL Enbridge Settlement Agreement. We suggest that
you review this document and propose a lease agreement based on these solutions to the legitimate
issues NPLC raises in this letter. Undertaking to do so would greatly simplify the consultation and
negotiation process, making it very cost effective for all concerned. As recently as Tuesday of this week,
a pipeline company has fundamentally agreed to these terms on another pipeline project, referring to
the issues resolution and compensation levels as ”industry standard”.
Upon receipt of your advice that Provident Energy will be responsible for all reasonable legal, consultant
and negotiating committee costs incurred with respect to these specific negotiations, we will be pleased
to discuss with you mutually convenient meeting arrangements. Since NPLC members, directly affected
by the Beatton River Replacement Project, have limited finances they will require payment of such
reasonable costs in an “agreed budget” amount in advance of negotiations. Be advised that these
proposed negotiations are strictly for the landowners affected by your Section 58 application. Again,
resolution to these many issues can be resolved in a very cost effective manner.
We look forwa rd to your early reply and resolution to our issues before the bee ring in ea rly May.
Sincerely,
David R. Core

PUBLIC SAFETY
Bnbridge adheres to the regulations of the National Energy Board and the Canadian Occupational
Health and Safety Act for all maintenance and construction activities. Enbridge is committed to the
safety of the landowner, Enbridge’s employees and contractors, the public who live near Enbridge’s
facilities and its pipelines. An Enbridge representative will monitor all excavation activity occurring
on the right-of-way to ensure its employees and contractors abide by all safety and environmental
requirements. Enbridge ensures that all unattended excavations are barricaded or fenced off. The type
of fencing depends on the level of risk associated with the excavation, considering such factors as the
location of the dig site, the degree of public access, the proximity of livestock and the length of time
the excavation is left unattended.

Management of invasive plant species is of paramount concern to Enbridge. The goal of
invasive species management is to prevent the introduction and spread of non—native plants
and to eliminate or control them, as practical. within the investigative and maintenance dig area.
To help achieve this goal, the following measures will be implemented during work activities.
1. All equipment shall arrive for work in a clean condition to minimize the risk of weed
introduction. Any equipment which arrives in a dirty condition will not be allowed to work
until it has been cleaned off at a suitable location.
2. Equipment passing through areas identiﬁed as having a weed problem will be cleaned
thoroughly with all soil and debris removed prior to continuing work on the right-of-way.
3. Weed growth will be monitored and controlled on a routine basis until the integrity and
; maintenance activity is completed.
l
g 4. Control the growth of noxious or nuisance weeds on topsoil storage piles by hand
' cultivating, mowing or if necessary using selective. nonpersistent herbicides. Control will
3 be initiated before weedy species mature (i.a., produce seed).
i
' 5. Weed growth will be frequently monitored during restoration activities, and weed control
‘ measures applied on a site—speciﬁc basis.
6. Areas of poor plant cover will be reseeded and weed control measures will be applied if
warranted.
7. Weed species of concern that are identiﬁed at Enbridge work sites will be treated.
Manual removal of plants or chemical treatment will occur. If weeds are manually
removed when in ﬂower, the weed material will be disposed of in an approved land—ﬁll
facility.
8. Record all weed treatment and monitoring. Provide records of weed control measures |
and weed treatment to the Landowner for any treatment on hislher lands. 3
!
Notes: |
1. Prior to integrity and maintenance work, pull out or mow problem weed species from ‘
heavily infested areas and dispose of as required. i
2. Salvage topsoil from the full dig and access areas of heavy weed infestations, as
required. Store topsoil from the affected area separately.
' 3. Clean all topsoil handling equipment once past the area. Clean equipment at weed
j clean-off stations during nonfrozen conditions with shovels. compressed air, or high-
! pressure water, if necessary. ‘

4. Record infestation areas and monitor following integrity and maintenance work. Provide
copy of records to Landowner.

5. Record location of clean-off site for future monitoring and, ifwarranted, weed control.

1. PIPELINE CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES
1.1 Joint Committee

Enbridge agrees to implement a Joint Committee for the Alberta Clipper and

Southern Lights Projects under the terms of reference set out in Schedule 1

attached to this Agreement.

1.2 Construction Monitor

One qualiﬁed, independent Construction Monitor with experience in pipeline

construction shall be appointed by MPLAISAPL per construction spread. The

appointment shall be agreed to by Enbridge, acting reasonably. The

Construction Monitor shall be on site continuously and is expected to monitor

construction on privater-held cultivated and pasture lands and address issu es of

concern to and by landowners and shall be available to the landowners. the Joint

Committee and Enbridge at all times. In terms of the compensation and role of

the Construction Monitor:

(a) Enbridge shall pay the reasonable fees (consistent with industry
standards) and expenses of the Construction Monitor. Enbridge shall
provide the Construction Monitor with a schedule of planned construction
activities and not less than 24 hours notice of any clearing, tcpsoil
stripping, grading, and/or reclamation activities on the lands (provided
however, that construction plans may be modiﬁed at the daily morning
meetings between the Contractor and En bridge) and the Construction
Monitor shall be provided free access (subject to safety requirements) to
all Enbridge’s construction activities to inspect clearing, topsoil stripping,
grading and reclamation activities. The Construction Monitor's
appointment shall and at the conclusion of construction. Following
completion of construction. the Construction Monitor shall be re—engaged
for post construction reclamation on an as—needed basis.

' (b) Enbridge's Chief Inspector and Environmental Inspector (“Enbridge’s

; inspectors") will review the feasibility of implementing corrective or

Q remedial measures suggested by the Construction Monitor. The

; Construction Monitor will bring issues to the attention of Enbridge's

i inspectors in a timely manner for resolution in the ﬁeld and will bring

l systemic issues or concerns to the Joint Committee for consideration. In

= the event that Enbridge’s Inspectors and the Construction Monitor cannot

l agree, the applicable Enbridge Project Manager will be contacted by the
parties and take immediate action to resolve the issue.

(c) The Construction Monitor shall not have the authority to direct the
activities of Enbridge, Enbridge’s employees, contractors, or agents, or to
direct the cessation of any of Enbridge's activities.

3

(d) The Construction Monitor shall ﬁle interim and ﬁnal reports with the
National Energy Board. Copies of interim and ﬁnal reports shall be ‘
provided to the Joint Committee.
1.3 Complaint Tracking
Enbridge shall establish and make available to landowners a Landowner I
Complaint Tracking system for the proposed construction.
I
2. SITE PREPARATION AND CONSTRUCTION I
2.1 Pre-Construction Meeting with Landowner
Prior to construction. each affected landowner will be contacted by Enbridge's I
project manager or designated agent to review the timing of construction and :
discuss site—speciﬁc issues and implementation of mitigation and rehabilitation I
measures in accordance with this agreement. These site speciﬁc issues will be |
documented on the Construction Line List and recorded in Appendix "A" attached .
hereto prior to the commencement of construction.
| 2.2 Depth of Cover Survey on Existing Lines
' Enbridge shall undertake a depth of cover survey of its existing pipelines within
' or contiguous to the right-of-way proposed for Alberta Clipper and LSr and shall
. provide its ﬁndings to individual landowners on request. Where it is determined
I that cover over any of such pipelines is less than 0.6 metres and such reduced
I depth interferes with the cuitivation of the landowner’s lands or poses a safety
I concern, Enbridge shall, at its option, either:
' (a) restore the depth of cover to a minimum 0.6 metres;
(b) otherwise implement mitigative measures so as to ensure the
continuance of ordinary cultivation and safe crossing of the landowner's
farming equipment over the pipeline(s); or
(c) with respect to cultivated lands and with the landowner’s agreement, pay
compensation for any resulting crop loss or other direct damages.
2.3 Wet Soils Shutdown Policy
The Wet Soils Shutdown Policy, as set out in Appendix BB of the ESA ﬁled with
the Southern Lights and Alberta Clipper Applications and attached hereto as
Schedule 2 will govern the practices of Enbridge for pipeline construction, repair
and maintenance during wet soil conditions. As set out therein, the decision to
suspend activities due to excessively wet soil conditions will be made by the
Chief Inspector in consultation with the Environmental Inspector and with the
input of the Construction Monitor, subject to the following additional provisions:
4

(a) In addition to the criteria set out in Schedule 2, plasticity of the surface
soil to a depth of 10-20 cm (4—8 in.) will be a factor considered by
Enbridge's inSpectors.

(b) Where weather conditions are such that excessively wet/thawed soil
conditions are likely to occur, contingency measures may, if warranted
and practicable, be implemented prior to the occurrence of the indicators
set out in Schedule 2.

(0) Where topsoil has been replaced, all heavy trafﬁc is to be suspended in
excessively wetfthawed soil conditions.

2.4 Stripping topsoil

Prior to installing the pipeline(s), and unless othenwise agreed by the landowner,

Enbridge will strip topsoil from the full construction rig ht-of-way width on

cultivated, hay, pasture and bush-pasture lands during non-frozen conditions.

Narrower stripping width will be utilized during construction on native prairie,

wetlands. and locations of site-specific features which require narrowing down.

The topsoil will be stored within and adjacent to the construction right-of-way

boundaries. The topsoil and subsoil will be piled separately and Enbridge will

exercise due diligence to ensure that topsoil and subsoil are not mixed.
2.5 Compaction

Enbridge will conduct subgrade sun‘ace bulk density testing on the right-of—way

prior to ditching (to establish the baseline) and after backﬁlling with a view to

ultimately restoring the right-of-way ditchline to within ten percent of the original
subgrade surface baseline measurement.

Where req uired by Enbridge, stripped topsoil will be over-wintered and replaced

in the following year such that the easement lands are returned to the

surrounding grade. If. following over-wintering of the topsoil and following return
to grade, there is subsidence in excess of 2-inches. Enbridge shall, in
consultation with the landowner, restore the affected area to grade by re-stripping
topsoil and re—grading the subsoils or by applying other restorative techniques in
certain localized areas, importation of topsoil may be undertaken

If the construction of the pipeline causes a restriction of the natural ﬂow of water

due to too much or not enough subsidence, Enbridge will restore to pre-

construction contours and drainage.
2. 6 Boundaries

Enbiidge agrees to stake the outside boundary of the work space which will

include easement and temporary workspace . Where topsoil is to be stored off

easement, the stakes will not be removed during the stripping operation. The
stakes will be located at 50-metre intervals prior to construction. The intervals or
distance between stakes may decrease as deemed necessary in order to
maintain sight lines and easement boundaries in areas of sight obstructions,
rolling terrain or stream and road crossings.

Dear Mr. Santos,
In response to your e-mail of today’s date, I am writing to inform you that I will not be signing a
confidentiality agreement to obtain a copy of the geotechnical report.
Landowners and their consultants should bear no risk of liability for your proposed project. Your
company and the National Energy Board have already imposed far too many of your companies risks
and liabilities on landowners. Affected landowners should not be requested to sign any documents that
create another risk to them, for your project, or be imposed upon by such a request by the National
Energy Board. The information in the proposed report should be readily available to affected
landowners without risk of a lawsuit.
Sincerely,
David R. Core

Dear Anne-Marie:
         Attached please find copies of invoices from landowners and personnel associated with the North Peace
Landowners committee. The purpose of the invoices was to cover landowner costs, covering their time utilized in
attempting to persuade Provident Energy Ltd to negotiate with the landowners affected by their “Beatton River
Crossing” pipeline project.
         As you are very well aware, this project has been a controversial one from the very beginning. A majority
of the landowners affected by this project have consistently attempted and requested Provident Energy to come to
the negotiating table and negotiate concerns and issues of the landowners affected by the project. Provident chose
to disregard the requests of the Landowners. The response of Provident Energy, and their local surface lands
representatives, Roy Northern Land Service Ltd, sufficiently aggravated the landowners to the point of the
landowners forming as a group, known as the NPLC/CAEPLA group. Within this group, Mr Dave Core with
CAEPLA, was elected as our lead negotiator.
         Unfortunately, due to Provident’ refusal to negotiate with NPLC/CAEPLA, costs for landowner time
utilized in attempting to convince Provident to come to the negotiating table and negotiate with NPLC/CAEPLA,
were escalating. The costs associated to landowner time currently amounts to $ 89298.79. It is my understanding
approval for the section 58 portion of the line crossing the Beatton River, has not been approved to date. We
therefore request the National Energy Board to insist, as one of the conditions for approval, Provident must redeem
these attached invoices.
         Should you require more information regarding this matter, please feel free to contact me, either by phone
or e-mail. Thank you kindly for your attention to this matter.
Yours truly,
Thor Skafte
Chairperson, NPLC/CAEPLA.
