 5.     The potential environmental and socio-economic effects of the Project, including those to be
       considered under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 (Factors and Scope of Factors
       available here).
7.     Potential impacts of the Project on Aboriginal interests
10. Contingency planning for spills, accidents or malfunctions, during construction and operation of the
       Project.
11. Safety and security during construction and operation of the Project, including emergency response
       planning and third-party damage prevention.
The BC Metis Federation (BCMF) is a non-profit organization established in 2011 with a mandate to ensure
the well being of our some 7200 grassroots members. The BCMF Consultation Office has identified over 200
members registered in towns within 100 km of the proposed project who may be directly or indirectly
affected by the proposed project, who may have knowledge that can enhance the EA, elucidate impacts to
Aboriginal Rights, and/or be able to offer valuable insight into contingency and safety planning for the
proposed project during construction and operations. Some of our members are very active and dependent
on the land, and deserve a voice in the process.
Due in part to the barriers that many of our members face (including lack of knowledge of the regulatory
process and lack of computer and technology literacy and access, but also lack of engagement of local
members), we feel that the voice of the BCMF members who live and work in and near the proposed project
may not accurately nor adequately be reflected in both the information base used to make the final approval
decision, nor in the operational legacy of the project itself. Additionally, there is little evidence to support
that our members have been supported to provide informed feedback to project information to date.
The BCMF Consultation Office would like to gather knowledge from our members to support a responsible
and inclusive project decision, and we encourage both the NEB and the proponent to support equitable
participation by BCMF members in the process.

1.     The need for the Project.
Tourmaline Oil Corp. is one of the largest natural gas producers in Canada and is growing at a rapid pace since
starting up in 2008. We have large land positions in Alberta and BC, and are one of the largest shippers on the
current TransCanada Nova system. Over the past few years we have noticed a significant change in the
environment for pipeline transportation, and it is becoming increasingly more difficult to secure firm service.
The proposed expansion of the NGTL system is an important part of TOU’s growth plan, playing a key role in
meeting our growing supply. This expansion project would be an asset for both NGTL and the Alberta Oil and
Gas industry, by enhancing the system integrity and viability and freeing up more transportation for
producers such as Tourmaline to expand. The current economic environment is very competitive, and with
the present restrictions and bottle necks due to lack of service, we believe we have not been able to reach
our full potential as a natural gas player. As one of TransCanada’s larger customers we feel we would provide
a valuable perspective for the deliberation of the Towerbirch Expansion Project, and we hope you consider
our application.

Black Swan Energy is a producer of Montney gas in NE BC, with approximately 73 Tcf OGIP, and 15-42 Tcfe
recoverable. The infrastructure and transportation currently available in the area is insufficient to handle
increased volumes of gas of this magnitude. This situation will severely limit our growth potential, and has
already impacted the rate at which we are developing our lands as we do not want to drill wells that will be
stranded. We are in the queue to take on processing and transportation capacity within the framework of the
existing infrastructure, but unless expansion occurs in the area our growth will be limited. The proposed
integrated system pipeline will provide the needed transportation for NE BC to access gas markets. Our
results have been positive, and if sufficient infrastructure were to be in place to handle more volumes, we
could and would accelerate our drilling program. We are eager to support a larger scale development of our
Montney resource and are only limited by access to infrastructure and transportation to markets. Black Swan
Energy supports the proposal by Nova Gas Transmission for the pipeline project as outlined in the application
and intends to monitor the proceeding.

         The Provinchl government's stance on MEtis consultation is another obstade. As stated previously in
         this report, the British Columbian govemment does not recognize its coustfutional obhgation to
         consult with the M6tis. Untl British Columbia jafro the federal goveminent in recognizing M6tis richts

       Steps of Consultation
       Con6utaLtiOn must follow Certain Steps in Order tO be meaningful and effective, Each step must be
       fouowed comectly and no step can be left out if consultation is to be considered complete'
       The M6tis Nation of Alberta and the M6tis Nation of thtario each present five steps of consultation
       between the Gown and the M6tiswi,yhi, These five steps are sllffident for a basis for CO"ultation in
       British Columbia'
            1, Notice
       The first step in proper consultation is to give notice to the M6tis communfty whose poten_tial or
       eristing AboriSnal rithts may be inffinged by a proposed project, Notice must be given to the
       zlppropriate representative of the MEtis communfty. Notice fo an individual M4ds dtizen does not
       corLStitrte a COmPletion of this Step. The 'duty to consult is a duty to a collective. Sinply holding a
       public foqum or ta]chg out az\ ad in a local nevepaper does not satisfy the community's richt to be
       consulted1
                                                                                           \  ` . >
            2. Capadtyfftlnding                   -
       The second step involves funding of the consultation process. Consultation is an experfeive process
       which requhes extensive research- funding Should be.given to the MEtis community by the
       govemlnent, This funding essentially levels the p.laying field betveen the Crown and the M€tis
       communfty and allows the consultai±on process to be meaningful.
          \
            3. Info-ation Exhage
       The exchange of information between the M6tis community and cue Gorm is the third step of the
       consultation process. h this Step the Cror^m must fully info- the M6tis community abolit the
                                                    I
       proposed project. hformation about the projects location and potential environmental impact must be
        disclosed by the Crown. The M6tis community also has an obligation to irfoin the Crown about aH
       Mffi? cultllral and economic activities in the area Of the proposed project. These achvities can include
       hunting, fishing or trapping, for example-
            4. Understanding E-
        h this Step Of the Conguhafon process, the Crowr+ developer, and the MEtis community examine the
        details of the proposed project and attempt to determine how M€tis rights may be affected. If the
        pardes determine that there win be no tangible effect on- M6tis richtS, the consultation may be
        considered complete. The MEtis community must be told if there are any changes to the proposed
        project after this point in the ceeuitation.

              communities. Accommedation should seek to avoid negative consequences of projects on Meds
              cultural and econondc practices. Accommodation may also involve compensation to Metig
              commI]nitieS. Both sides must show flexpbifity in this final step..

        Conclusion
        The Crown has a constitutional chligation to consult with the MEtis when a prtyect thleateus asserted
        or existing M6tis richts, This duty was created because of the Supreme Court of Canada decisions in
        H4Z'de Mf1'O71, Tck« R7-I)gr Z|z'»gz-i, and Mz'fa'sezt? Creg. Section 35 of the Canadian Constitution reinforces
        the fact that the duty to consult appHes to the MStisl
        The federal govermnent recognizes the fact that the arty to consult applies to the M6tis, Th provincial
        govemment, however, dces mt recognize this fact. Through negotiation or fitigation, the stance of the
        provincial govemment must be brougiv+ in line with that of the federal goverz`ment.
        The drty to consult iS a duty to collective Abchgival groups. It dces not apply to individual
        Aboriginals. `The M€tis in British Cohmbia win have to crez=te a screening process in order to
        determine which projects require consultation. Funding for consultation must also be secured from the
        a owe-ant.
        Solutions must be found to the two obstEICle9 outlined in this report, The fret obstacle to MEtis
        con5ultation iS the Presence Of multiple M6tis orgndzatioas in the prowince', ine iecond obstacle is the
        provincial govemment` s approach to MEds consultation.
        The conrdtation process involving five steps is stlffiCient tO act aS a frameWCck for future conSulfatiOI\.
        Expansion of this process will be necessary in the future.

            Hearing Order GH-003-2015
     Black Swan Energy is a Calgary based privately heldjunior oil and gas producer backed by
     Azimuth Capital Management, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Warburg Pincus. To
     date the company has raised $850 million of committed equity capital and has established a
     large, contiguous position in the liquids-rich fairway of the Montney play in northeast British
     Columbia OVEBC).
     We have focused our growth on development of the Montney at Aitken Creek, where we hold
     over 2 1 7,000 net acres of Montney rights. Black Swan estimates a drilling inventory of over
     2,800 horizontal Montney locations across its lands with approximately 73 Tcf OGIP
     representing 15 to 42 Tcfe ofrecoverable resource. At year-end 201 5 Black Swan had drilled 44
     Montney horizontal wells with 20 of those wells on production. The company is currently
     producing 35 MMcf/d through regional facilities, including 25 MMcf;/d through the McMahon
     gas processing plant. In January 201 6 Black Swan started up its 100% owned and operated
     Aitken Creek Gas Plant with a raw capacity of 50 MMcf/d.
     The company has had success in its drilling program and is capable of achieving production of
   - - iO-0- MMQfldin flVe years utilizing ordy-3 0% -ofits currentMontney-lands, -ho`LIVeVer3--the-
     infrastructure and transportation currently available in the area is insufficient to handle increased
     volumes of gas of this magnitude. This lack of infrastructure could severely limit Black Swan,s
     growth potential, and has already impacted the rate at which we are developing our lands and
     investing in our asset. We are unable to justify ongoing drilling of wells that will be stranded so
     have restricted ourselves to a one rig continuous drilling program on a go fiorward basis which is
     capable of adding 20 wells per year. Black Swan is counting on Towerbirch Expansion Project to
     support growth volunleS by 20 1 8.
     Black Swan Energy has been active in NEBC since 201 1, drilling our first Well in 2012. Over the
     next three years we drilled 43 wells, and built a 50 MMcf/d gas plant with plans to expand to 100
     MMcf/d by Q1 2017- We have remained active throughout the recent period oflow commodity
     prices, creating jobs in the community, paying royalties and taxes to the provincial and federal
     govemments, and have spearheaded a First Nations training initiative for work in the oilfield. We

 are prepared to accelerate our development program should further transportation be available,
providing even more social benefits to the community through jobs and taxes.
We have made efforts to take on transportation capacity within the framework of the existing
infrastructure, but without expansion in the area our growth will be significantly limited. This
will have direct implications to our business plan and secondary implications to the many service
providers we deal with to execute on our plan. By expanding the Nova system through the
Towerbirch project, there will be greater access to the liquid NIT market which offers the best
exposure for NEBC gas producers to the North American markets. Not only do we support
Nova, s Towerbirch Expansion Project fior near term development, we would actively support
additional infrastructure and transportation expansion projects to ensure the success of our longer
term growth objectives.
The timing of the Towerbirch Expansion Project is imperative to our business plan, at this time
no incremental egress is available off the Spectra Fort Nelson T-North pipeline system. In
addition to existing Nova offtakes at Sunset and Gordondale, other offtakes from the T-North
system include T-South, and Alliance pipelines which are fully contracted and offer limited
intermptible service. Our results have been outstanding) and if sufficient infrastructure were to
be in place to handle more volumes, we could and would accelerate our drilling program. We are
eager to support larger scale development of our Montney resource but are limited by access to
infrastnlcture and transportation to markets.
With the interconnection to the Spectra T-North system, the proposed Towerbirch project
provides an optimal solution to connect NEBC to NIT markets. The interconnect is expected to
relieve pressure on the T-North and T-South which are over supplied, thereby allowing
producers to increase production to fair market pricing. Because this gas will flow on the Nova
system and supply gas to AECO markets alongside existing shippers, Black Swan supports
rolled-in tolls fior the Towerbirch expansion.
NEBC has a tremendous natural gas resource which is capable of achieving economic retums
that rival the best plays in North America. To ensure the continued health and success of our
industry we must be able to provide ongoing access to markets for our most competitive assets.
In this context it is critical fior NEBC producers to gain access to through the development of
expanded pipeline infrastructure. Black Swan Energy supports the proposal by TCPL fior the
Towerbirch Expansion Proj ect.

Attention: National Energy Board
Dear Sir or Madam;
Re: Letter of Comment for the NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL) Towerbirch Expansion Project
Reference Hearing Number: GH-003-2015
File Number: OF-Fac-Gas N081-2015—16—02 (per Filing A74334)
Canbriam Energy Inc. is an Exploration and Producing company in the Montney region of Northeast British
Columbia. Available pipeline access to various markets is crucial to Canbriam’s success and continued
growth. Recent and past pipeline constraints have shown to have an immediate impact to market pricing
and can quickly make development plans uneconomical. The NGTL Towerbirch project which includes the
Groundbirch Mainline Expansion Loop will benefit Canbriam by providing improved access to the
AECO/NIT market by decreasing constraints along the existing Groundbirch pipeline segment on NGTL.
As a low cost producer, Canbriam Energy has excellent potential for responsible expansion in the
Montney region providing direct long-term benefits to the regional economy. We support the concept of
rolled-in-tolling for this project as existing and new shippers on this segment of pipeline intend to access
the NGTL system for years to come.
Yours truly,
Mark nglish

Subject: Health Canada’s Letter of Comment on the Environmental Impact Statement for
the 2017 Towerbirch Expansion (GH-003-2015; OF—Fac-Gas-N081-2015-l6 02)
Dear Ms. Young:
As a registered Commenter, Health Canada (HC) respectfully submits this Letter of Comment to
the National Energy Board (NEB) on the proposed 2017 Towerbirch Expansion Project (the
Project) for consideration.
HC is the federal department responsible for helping Canadians maintain and improve their
health. HC participates in the environmental assessment process as a F ederal Authority as
deﬁned by Section 20 of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act 2012 (CEAA 2012).
Accordingly, HC provides expertise in its possession with respect to the potential impacts of a
proposed project on human health, speciﬁcally in the areas of air quality, drinking and
recreational water quality, noise, country foods, and human health risk assessment. Consistent
with subsection 5(l)(c) of CEAA 2012, HC focused its review on impacts on the health of
Aboriginal peoples, in view of the health concerns raised by Aboriginal peoples during the
environmental assessment process.
HC reviewed the following information:
(1) Environmental and Socio-Economic Assessment (ESA) dated September 02, 2015
(2) Information requests and responses up until February 29, 2016.
HC’s review of the Application noted concerns in the assessment of air quality and noise, and the
potential for human health impacts. Speciﬁc information gaps or areas of clariﬁcation are
identiﬁed in detail in Table 1.
Thank you for providing HC with the opportunity to comment on the BSA for the 2017
Towerbirch Expansion. If you have any questions regarding HC’s response or if you identify any
other speciﬁc human health concerns with respect to this Project, we would be pleased to make
available the specialist or expert information or knowledge within the Department’s possession.

Re: NWIGU Comments in Opposition to Rolled in Rate Treatment

NGTL Towerbirch Expansion Proj ect .

OF-FAC-Gas~081~2015-16 02

NEB Hearing Order GH-003—2015

As the Executive Director of the Northwest Industrial Gas Users (“NWIGU”), I urge the
National Energy Board (“Board”) to conclude, consistent with the written evidence of the Export
Users Group (“BUG”) and Northwest Pipeline LLC (“Northwest”), which are collectively
referred to as the Paciﬁc Northwest Group (“PNG”), that the NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd.
(“NGTL”) Application for the Towerbirch Expansion Project (“Project”) is not in the public
interest as proposed. NWIGU has reviewed and supports the written evidence of the PNG.
NWIGU’S comments are solely focused on Board Issue 4: The method of toll and tariff
regulation.

NWIGU is a non—proﬁt trade association comprised of approximately 40 end-users of
natural gas with major facilities in the States of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho in the United
States. NWIGU members include diverse industrial interests, including food processing, pulp
and paper, wood products, aluminum, steel, chemicals, electronics, aerospace, and healthcare
providers. The association participates in various regulatory matters that affect member interests.
NWIGU member companies purchase transportation services from Northwest, and from GTN
either directly or through capacity release from marketers and purchase sales and transportation
services from the local distribution company members of the EUG and others that acquire
service from these pipelines.

NWIGU previously participated in the Komie North and North Montney proceedings as '
part of the PNG, but is participating in the Towerbirch proceeding only as a Commenter due to
budgetary constraints. Many of NWIGU’S member companies receive gas delivered through
Westcoast Energy Inc. (“Westcoast”) and Northwest transmission facilities and BUG member

companies” distribution facilities, and thus, as explained below, NWIGU member companies will

be impacted by any decision made in this proceeding.

On September 2, 2015, NGTL ﬁled its Application for approval to construct and operate
pipeline facilities that will become part of the existing NGTL System. The proposed Towerbirch
Expansion Project includes: (a) construction of 87 km of new gas pipelines and associated '
facilities in northwest Alberta and northeast British Columbia; (b) Tower Lake Section (32 km of
762 mm OD pipe); (c) Groundbirch Mainline Loop (55 km of 914 mm OD pipe); and (d)
additional associated facilities, including meter stations, valves sites and pipeline tie-ins.

NGTL argues that the Project was triggered by existing and incremental ﬁrm service
contracts for the receipt of natural gas on the NGTL System, and that the facilities are sized to
meet design ﬂows, which include existing and incremental ﬁrm service contract ﬂows and
forecast supply for the Tower Lake Area. NGTL proposes to treat the costs for the Project on a
rolled-in basis, and to determine the tolls for services in accordance with the NGTL toll design
methodology in effect, and as approved, at any given time. For the reasons stated below,
NWIGU opposes NGTL’s proposal to recover its cost on a rolled-in basis.

NWIGU does not oppose the Project, only the proposed rate treatment, which could have
a broad negative impact on the natural gas market in the Paciﬁc Northwest of the United States.
Extending NGTL’S rolled—in tolling model in northeast British Columbia would be inconsistent
with the Board-approved and long-standing competitive model already in place, and with the
Board’s conclusions in the Komie North and North Montney cases, proceedings that NWIGU
participated in.

A signiﬁcant quantity of the gas delivered and consumed by NWIGU member companies .
originates on the Westcoast system. In fact, due to system constraints on the Northwest system,
gas supply is only available to some NWIGU member companies at the Sumas Receipt Point at
certain times of the year. Rolled in pricing for the Project could jeopardize NWIGU member
companies’ continued access to sufﬁcient reliable gas supply. If the Board approves the Project

- and rolled-in pricing proposal, Westcoast may have difﬁculty attracting new gas supply which
may result in decontracting and underutilization of existing facilities. If disparities in cost
recovery, tolling models and rate designs incentivizes producers to connect new supply from
NEBC to the NGTL system (which has no physical means to deliver such supply to the
Northwest interconnect at the Sumas Receipt Point), the Paciﬁc Northwest region may be unable
to maintain reliable natural gas or electric service. This could have a devastating impact on
NWIGU member companies and the region in general.

If, on the other hand, Westcoast and NGTL are allowed to compete on a level playing
ﬁeld, the incentive for a producer to serve the Paciﬁc Northwest market by connecting to
Westcoast would not be undermined by a subsidized and artiﬁcially low rolled-in rate on the
NGTL system. Without a level playing ﬁeld, gas supply in the Paciﬁc Northwest may be
severely impacted because gas from the Rockies is not always available on the Northwest system
due to system constraints. '

To Whom it May Concern,
Tourmaline Oil Corp. is the second largest natural gas producer in Canada and has
grown at a rapid pace since starting up in 2008. We have large land positions in Northwest
Alberta and Northeast BC. The proposed Towerbirch Expansion Project is an important part of
TOU’s growth plan in this area. After much research and surveying, when approaching this from
a distance and cost perspective, we have determined that this is the most optimal solution to
move this supply to market. Without the Towerbirch expansion the growth and development
of this area would not be possible.
The Towerbirch Expansion Project will allow our low cost Montney play to access the L
liquid NlT market further allowing us to meet the needs of our growing supply. As one of the l
largest shippers on the NGTL pipeline, we have many long term contracts and will continue to
be a large shipper into the future.
This project will allow us to continue on our growth trajectory as well as help to create ‘
new opportunities for shippers like us in the Alberta markets.

To lThom It May Concem,
Storm Resources Ltd. (SRX) is respectfully writing today to voice support fior the Towerbirch Expansion Project
as a Commenter and participant.
In this current economic downtum, creating and maintaining jobs is very important. The benefltS tO Canada by
building this pipeline, through royalties and taxes will assist in providing economic prosperity. Now is the tinle
to advance this project, providing growth and employment prospects fior both Alberta and British Columbia.
Storm Resources Ltd. is a producer of upstream gas in the North East BC / Umbach Area, Production is fi.om the
Montney fiormation. The Montney shows tremendous resource potential and has one of the lowest costs of
production in North America, however there is currently no access to competitive, liquid North America markets
due to pipeline constraints on existing infrasrfucture. The Towerbirch Expansion Project would give SRX and
other Montney producers in North East BC access to liquid eastem North American markets and would spur on
additional drilling activity.
SRX is committed to sustainable upstream development and the NGTL Towerbirch pipeline provides the most
efficient, COSt effective, and Safe SOlutiOn tO COnneCt Product tO market. The Towerbirch Expansion will allow
greater opportunity fior producers to effectively sustain growth and success by further developing their fields in
an economically sound manner. Not only will this ensure the success of many producers but it will also create
thousands of jobs and First Nation opportunities in the local areas.

RE:      NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd.'s ("NGTL") Application for Towerbirch Expansion Project
         NEB File No.: OF-Fac-Gas-N081-2015-16-02
Dear Ms. Young,
Painted Pony Petroleum Ltd. ("Painted Pony") is a producer of natural gas and natural gas liquids
operating in northeast British Columbia.
Obtaining firm transportation service in the area in which Painted Pony operates has become
extremely difficult in recent years. The recent success by Painted Pony and other industry participants
in northeast British Columbia, exploring for and developing the Montney zone, have clearly indicated
that the Montney has, and will continue to be, one of the primary growth engines for Canadian natural
gas for many years to come. Many of the traditional areas serviced by existing Canadian pipeline
capacity will struggle to compete against the well-known boom in low cost US shale gas production
that has occurred in recent years. In order for Canadian natural gas producers like Painted Pony to
compete in the North American market, it is critical that pipeline Infrastructure be developed to allow
these low cost producing areas, such as the NE BC Montney, direct access to markets. The
Towerbirch Expansion project would allow Painted Pony to deliver natural gas from our already
contracted delivery point at Sunset Creek on the Spectra Westcoast system ("T-North") onto
TransCanada Pipelines ("TCPL") NOVA Gas Transmission ("NGTL") system.
Painted Pony's major assets are in close proximity to the Spectra T-North system, making it the most
economically viable option for Painted Pony to transport natural gas into TCPL's NGTL system,
servicing the large and highly liquid AECO Hub. Without sufficient ability to move gas from the Spectra
T-North system onto the NGTL system, some of the lowest cost gas in Canada will be trapped and
unable to compete in the markets of eastern Canada and the US.
In June 2015, the Corporation signed a definitive agreement with Westcoast Energy Inc.
("Westcoast") for 200 MMcf/d with a 25 year term and 20 MMcf/d with an 18 year, 8 month term. The
expected commencement of the contracted service with Westcoast, on or about November 1, 2016,
was planned to coincide with the anticipated startup of the AltaGas Townsend area gas processing
plant (the "AltaGas Townsend Plant"), which is being built as part of a strategic alliance arrangement
                                                                                                    paintedpony.ca
 between Painted Pony and AltaGas Ltd. AltaGas also functions as Painted Pony's primary natural gas
and natural gas liquids marketer. The AltaGas Townsend Plant is currently under construction and
well on its way to completion. The AltaGas Townsend Plant will provide Painted Pony with firm
processing capacity for 150 MMcf/d on or before November 1, 2016, with firm volumes increasing to
198 MMcf/d after the first year of operation. Subsequent to the Spectra commitment, Painted Pony
has contracted firm supply into the NGTL Towerbirch expansion of 130 MMcf/d to minimize the risk
associated with a lack of diversification of sales points. These contracts combine to be a critical
component of Painted Pony's five-year plan to develop this premium North American asset.
Painted Pony, as part of our long term plan and as part of our desire to benefit the communities in
which we operate, has employed many local companies, including those operated by and employing
First Nations' members. This engagement is not only for the work associated with our capital
spending, but also in the planning of our activities to minimize impact. We maintain a high level of
contact with all of these communities and have recently become part of an industry project to offer
training and direct long term employment opportunities to local First Nations members.
Painted Pony has engaged AltaGas and one additional marketer to assist us in the arrangement of
transactions from Sunset Creek onto the NGTL System, with both existing and future potential
customers. The approval of the Towerbirch Expansion Project, which will allow us to direct more than
half of the expected volumes from the AltaGas Townsend Plant directly onto the NGTL System, will
allow us to proceed into these potential contracts.
The Towerbirch Expansion Project is a critical component of Painted Pony's strategic plan as it will
provide the Corporation with firm transportation service for its growing production. It will allow low cost
NE BC Montney gas to compete directly with US Shale gas in the critical Eastern Canada and US
markets. By the end of 2017, Painted Pony plans to deliver total corporate production of 350 MMcfe/d
of natural gas and natural gas liquids volumes and as a result, requires the additional firm service
transportation the Towerbirch Expansion will provide.
In order for Painted Pony to diversify our sales points, access more liquid and efficient markets, with
minimal environmental disturbance through the looping and expansion of existing facilities, Painted
Pony strongly supports the NGTL Towerbirch Expansion. The timely construction of this expansion
project is key to Painted Pony's operations in 2017 and beyond, and a delay could have serious
implications to our business plan.

Fac-Gas-N081-2015-16-02
Dear Ms. Young,
Painted Pony Petroleum Ltd. ("Painted Pony") is a producer of natural gas and natural gas liquids operating in
northeast British Columbia.
Obtaining firm transportation service in the area in which Painted Pony operates has become extremely
difficult in recent years. The recent success by Painted Pony and other industry participants in northeast
British Columbia, exploring for and developing the Montney zone, have clearly indicated that the Montney
has, and will continue to be, one of the primary growth engines for Canadian natural gas for many years to
come. Many of the traditional areas serviced by existing Canadian pipeline capacity will struggle to compete
against the well-known boom in low cost US shale gas production that has occurred in recent years. In order
for Canadian natural gas producers like Painted Pony to compete in the North American market, it is critical
that pipeline Infrastructure be developed to allow these low cost producing areas, such as the NE BC

Calgary, (Alberta) T2R 0A8                                                                                             1
 Montney, direct access to markets. The Towerbirch Expansion project would allow Painted Pony to deliver
natural gas from our already contracted delivery point at Sunset Creek on the Spectra Westcoast system ("T-
North") onto TransCanada Pipelines ("TCPL") NOVA Gas Transmission ("NGTL") system.
Painted Pony's major assets are in close proximity to the Spectra T-North system, making it the most
economically viable option for Painted Pony to transport natural gas into TCPL's NGTL system, servicing the
large and highly liquid AECO Hub. Without sufficient ability to move gas from the Spectra T-North system
onto the NGTL system, some of the lowest cost gas in Canada will be trapped and unable to compete in the
markets of eastern Canada and the US.
In June 2015, the Corporation signed a definitive agreement with Westcoast Energy Inc. ("Westcoast") for
200 MMcf/d with a 25 year term and 20 MMcf/d with an 18 year, 8 month term. The expected
commencement of the contracted service with Westcoast, on or about November 1, 2016, was planned to
coincide with the anticipated startup of the AltaGas Townsend area gas processing plant (the "AltaGas
Townsend Plant"), which is being built as part of a strategic alliance arrangement between Painted Pony and
AltaGas Ltd. AltaGas also functions as Painted Pony's primary natural gas and natural gas liquids marketer.
The AltaGas Townsend Plant is currently under construction and well on its way to completion. The AltaGas
Townsend Plant will provide Painted Pony with firm processing capacity for 150 MMcf/d on or before
November 1, 2016, with firm volumes increasing to 198 MMcf/d after the first year of operation. Subsequent
to the Spectra commitment, Painted Pony has contracted firm supply into the NGTL Towerbirch expansion of
130 MMcf/d to minimize the risk associated with a lack of diversification of sales points. These contracts
combine to be a critical component of Painted Pony's five-year plan to develop this premium North American
asset.
Painted Pony, as part of our long term plan and as part of our desire to benefit the communities in which we
operate, has employed many local companies, including those operated by and employing First Nations'
members. This engagement is not only for the work associated with our capital spending, but also in the
planning of our activities to minimize impact. We maintain a high level of contact with all of these
communities and have recently become part of an industry project to offer training and direct long term
employment opportunities to local First Nations members.
Painted Pony has engaged AltaGas and one additional marketer to assist us in the arrangement of
transactions from Sunset Creek onto the NGTL System, with both existing and future potential customers.
The approval of the Towerbirch Expansion Project, which will allow us to direct more than half of the
expected volumes from the AltaGas Townsend Plant directly onto the NGTL System, will allow us to proceed
into these potential contracts.
The Towerbirch Expansion Project is a critical component of Painted Pony's strategic plan as it will provide
the Corporation with firm transportation service for its growing production. It will allow low cost NE BC
Montney gas to compete directly with US Shale gas in the critical Eastern Canada and US markets. By the end
of 2017, Painted Pony plans to deliver total corporate production of 350 MMcfe/d of natural gas and natural
gas liquids volumes and as a result, requires the additional firm service transportation the Towerbirch
Expansion will provide.
In order for Painted Pony to diversify our sales points, access more liquid and efficient markets, with minimal
environmental disturbance through the looping and expansion of existing facilities, Painted Pony strongly
supports the NGTL Towerbirch Expansion. The timely construction of this expansion project is key to Painted

         EXPANSION PROJECT OF-FAC-GAS-N081 -201 5-1 6-02
        HEARING ORDER GH-003-2015
Pengrowth Energy Corporation is engaged in the development of natural gas in the province of
British Columbia. Pengrowth has a vested interest in the future pipeline development within and
out of the Province.
Transportation options play a vital role in allowing producers to maximize value. The current
transportation options are extremely limited and some options are unavailable. Future
sustainable growth in the area is limited without the expansion of pipeline capacity, and the
Towerbirch project plays an important role in our industry.
We anticipate the development of Towerbirch will provide an option for producers to ship to
Alberta where other export markets can be accessed. Pengrowth supports the proposal by
TCPL for the Towerbirch Expansion Project.

 Dear Mrs. MacWhirter:
 Re:      NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. Towerbirch Expansion Project Application oÍ 2
          September 2015, File OF-Fac-Gas-N081-2015-16 02 and Hearing Order GH-003-
          2015
          Environment and Climate Change Canada's Letter of Comment
 Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) has reviewed the.Towerbirch Expansion
 Project (the Project) Application and associated documentation as proposed by NOVA Gas
 Transmission Ltd (NGTL) (the Proponent). ECCC is participating in Hearing GH-003-2015 as a
 commenter pursuant to Section 58 of the National Energy Board Act.
 ECCC's comments are founded, upon departmental mandate and are focused on matters
 related to wildlife, vegetation and wetlands, and greenhouse gases (GHGs). Please note that
three attachments have been provided with this Letter of Comment: the first attachment
 provides specialist information on migratory birds, species at risk and wetlands; the second
attachment provides specific environmental assessment guidance for Western Toad; and the
third attachment provides advice on ECCC's support services for pipeline accidents and
 malfunctíons.
 Further to these attachments, below are detailed Project-specific comments on migratory birds,
species at risk, wetlands, pipeline accidents and malfunctions, and GHG emissions.
Misratorv Birds
The proposed Project crosses through Bird Conservation Region (BCR) 6. The Bird
Conservation Strategy for Bird Conservation Region 6 is available at: http://www.ec.qc.calmbc-
com/default.asp?lanq=En&n=8E2D5A3A-1. The Proponent has indicated in Section 6.8.2.1 in
the Environmental and Socio-economic Assessment that "clearing and construction activities
are planned to occur within the primary nesting period for migratory birds for this bird
conservation region (May 5 to August 10)."
                                                                                                1
       a    ECCC advises that proponents should be aware that habitat destruction (e.g. vegetation
           clearing and disturbance-related activities) during the nesting period for migiatory birds
          carries with it high risks of incidentaltake. Many bird nests are difficult to lõcate, even
          with highly trained observers. Proponents should be aware of the risks and take
          appropriate action to ensure they are in compliance with the Migratory Birds Convention
           4ct,1994 (MBCA).
     a    The Proponent identified Yellow Rail, Olive-Sided Flycatcher, Barn Swallow and old
          growth forest birds (Bay-Breasted Warbler, Cape May Warbler, Canada Warbler, Black
          Throated Green Warbler) as key indicators of wildlife and wildlife habitat for birds. The
          department notes that no shorebirds or waterfowl were selected as avian indicator
          species for this Project. ECCC recommends that in the selection of avian indicators:
               o   All applicable bird guilds (i.e., landbirds, shorebirds, waterbirds, and waterfowl)
                   be considered;
               o   Species of special conservation status not be over-emphasized, and that other
                   species which are more representative, common, and/or important ecologically
                   are appropriately considered; and
              o   The Bird Conservation Strategy for the appropriate Bird Conservation Region be
                   consulted.
 Establishing an accurate baseline that reflects natural inter-annual variation is important for
 predicting potential Project impacts. The Proponent conducted a wildlife reconnaissance survey,
 breeding bird surveys, and Yellow Rail call playback surveys.
     .  .ECCC recommends that surveys be conducted following Resource Information
          Standards Committee (RISC) Standards for all potentially impacted bird species not
          captured by the aforementioned surveys (i.e., where high suitability habitat exists for
         these species). For example, surveys for Trumpeter Swans should be conducted using
         the lnventory Methods for Waterfowl and Allied Species: Loons, Grebes, Swans, Geesé,
          Ducks, American Coot and Sandhill Crane RISC Standards; surveys for swallows should
         be conducted using Standard Inventory Methods for Swallows and Swifts RISC
         Standards.
 Please referto Attachmentl,'ECCC's Standard EnvironmenfalAssessment Migratory Birds,
Species af Rr.sk and Wetlands Advíce,' which provides further environmental assessment
information for migratory birds, species at risk and weilands.
Species At Risk
The Proponent identified 11 species that are assessed by the Committee on the Status of
Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) or listed under the Species af Risk Acf (SARA) with
the potentialto occur in the Local Study Area (LSA) and Regional Study Area (RSA). ln
addition, ECCC notes that the distribution of Little Brown Myotis and Northern Myotis, which are
SARA-listed as Endangered, and Bank Swallow, which ís COSEWIC-assessed ás threatened,
may overlap with Project components and, therefore, may have the potential to occur within the
Project area.
    a   To help the Responsible Authority meet its obligations under SARA s. zg, Eccc
         recommends that measures be taken to avoid or lessen adverse effects to listed wildlife
                                                                                                       2
          species and monitor those effects, consistent with any applicable recovery strategy and
         action plan.
     a   ECCC recommends that each SARA-listed and COSEWIC-assessed species with the
         potential to be impacted by the Project be assessed individually in the effects
        assessment.
     a  Supplementary EA recommendations for specific SARA-listed species that may be
        potentially impacted by this Project follow for your consideration.
         Rustv Blackbird. Short-eared Owland Common Niqhthawk
         ln Section 5.9.1.2 of the Environmental and Socio-economic Assessment, the Proponent
        did not consider Rusty Blackbird, Short-eared Owl and Common Nighthawk to be
        potentially affected by the Project and were not chosen as indicators based on "historical
         obseruations, baseline suruey results, range distribution maps, habitat requiremenfs and
         professional judgement."
        t     ECCC recommends that the Proponent provide a detailed rationale for this statement
              with specific information on habitat requiremerits, baseline survey results, and
              professional judgement for each species. ECCC notes that there is a "Management
              Plan for the Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) in Canada' and a Proposed
              "Recovery Strategy for the.Common Nighthawk (Chordeiles minor) in Canada",
              which should be consulted.
         Little Brown Mvotis and Northern Mvotis
        Little Brown Myotis and Northern Myotis were listed as Endangered under Schedule 1 of
        SARA due to their populations experiencing unprecedented population level declines
        nationally. The Proposed Recovery Strategy for Little Brown Myotis (Myotis lucifugus),
        Northern Myotis (Myotis septentrionalis), and Tri-colored Bat(Perimyofis suöfavus) in
        Canada was posted to the Species at Risk Public Registry in December 2015
        (http://reqistrelep-sarareqistrv.qc.caldocumenldefault e.cfm?documentlD=2475).
        Ð     lf the Project has the potential to impact the Little Brown Myotis and Northern Myotis,
              either directly or indirectly, ECCC recommends that the Proponent conduct baseline
              studies for the Little Brown Myotis arid Northern Myotis which would include, but not
              be limited to, desktop surveys conducted in combination with field surveys, and an
              assessment of the potential effects on each species.
        Western Toad
Please refer to Attachment2,'EnvironmentalAssessment Standard Guidance for the Western
 Toad which includes specific environmental assessment recommendations for this sþecies.
Wetlands
Table 6.7-1 in the Environmental and Socio-economic Assessment identifies the presence of
8 ha of wetlands expected to be lost or altered due to the Project in the Project Footprint, which
includes approximately 2 ha of non-peaty wetlands in forested areas, 3 ha of peatland wetlands
                                                                                                    3
  in forested areas and approximately 5 ha of non-peaty wetlands in the setfled area. The portion
 of the Project Footprint that is in British Columbia is located within the Areas of Continenial and
 Regional Significance to Waterfowl within the Joint Venture planning boundaries of British
 Columbia, which is designated as ecologically or socio-economically important to the region.
Three wetlands are located within the designated 'White Area' (or settled areas) of Alberta,
where the documented continuing loss or degradation of wetlands has reached critical levels.
As Project activities under the National Energy Board are federal activities, the goal of no net
loss of wetland functions, as described in the Federal Policy on Wetland Conservation (FpWC),
would apply when considering any wetlands impacted by the Project that are (i) designated as
ecologically or socio-economically important to a region or are (ii) located in geographic areas
where the documented continuing losg or degradation of wetlands has reachêd òritical levels.
The Proponent has provided information regarding the extent and type of weflands that would
be potentially impacted. ln addition, the Proponent conducted a weiland functions assessment
Íor 17 of the 28 wetlands that intersect the Project footprint (Proponent's Response to NEB lR
2.7, PDF pages 19-26).
     o   For wetlands where the no-net-loss of wetland functions objective applies, ECCC
         recommends that:
          t.   Measures be applied to the Project to achieve this objective and that the hierarchy
               of avoidance, minimization and compensation be used in achieving this. Supportiñg
               rationales should be provided for moving from avoidance to minimization to
               compensation, in order to fully document application of the mitigation hierarchy.
          [.   A detailed site-specific assessment of baseline wetland functions be completed prior
               to the start of Project construction for allwetlands that the Project would directly
               impact and for any wetland(s) that are hydrologically connected to these wetlands;
               such an assessment would include the following:
              o    Surveys to assess for the presence, abundance, density, and distribution of
                   migratory birds and species at risk (SARA-listed, and COSEWIC assessed) in
                   relation to potentially impacted wetlands and associated riparian areas. Surveys
                   should meet appropriate standards (e.9., RISC), be species or bird group specific
                   as appropriate, and be conducted during the appropriate times of the year.
              o    The spatial location and a description of the biological characteristics of each
                   impacted wetland, and the ecologicalservices and functions (hydrorogy,
                   biochemical cycling, habitat, climate) they provide. ECCC recommends that the
                   functions assessment be as specific as possible to the biological characteristics
                   of the wetland and to the ecological services and functions it provides.
         ¡il. Measures be implemented (for example, the installation of nest boxes) such that the
              temporary loss of wetland functions is reduced to the extent possible.
         tv.  Where impacts cannot be mitigated through avoidance and minimization and where
              it is demonstrated that there are ongoing effects (í.e., effects lasting longer than 5
              years), a Wetland Compensation Plan be developed and filed after the fifth complete
              growing season after the start of operations, which:
                                                                                                     4
                   .    Describes the baseline condition of the wetland ecological communities and

 Pipeline Accidents and Malfunctions
 ln the event of an environmental emergency, ECCC's Environmental Emergencies Program
efforts are aimed at reducing the consequence to the environment and human life or health.
ECCC's role in environmental emergencies is governed by the Department of the Environment
Act, Canadian Environmental Protection Act,1999, the Fishenes Act- Pollution Prevention
 Provisions, and the MBCA.
Please refer to Attachment 3, 'ECCC's Support Services for Pipeline Accidents and
Malfunctions' for further advice on ECCC's pipeline accidents and malfunctions expertise and
responsibilities.
Greenhouse Gases
The Proponent concludes that Project-related GHG emissions are insignificant. However, based
on the limited GHG information provided in the Project Application, ECCC recommends that
additional information is required to adequately assess the GHG impacts of the Project.
Specifically, ECCC recommends that the following GHG emission information be provided:
.     lnformation on the type of equipment to be used, both during the construction and operation
     phases. lnformation should include the proposed models and respective efficiencies, the
     availability of electricity, and the usage of electric equipment as an alternative to carbon-
     based fuel, if applicable.
o    lnformation on how fugitive emissions are to be prevented and/or controlled, including
     additional details on the planned aerial inspections, such as types of inspections/flyovers,
     frequency of inspections, and information on remote leak detection technologies employed
     (e.9. infrared or laser).
.    Where sources are expected during pipeline maíntenance, information on the mitigation
     measures that will be employed to minimize GHG releases.
o    An emissions estimation methodology. The potential maximum project GHG emissions are
     given as 0.01 Mlyear; however a GHG emissions estimation methodology is not filed with
     the Application.
o    lnformation on how fugitive emissíons are estimated (e.9. component counts and standard
     emission factors).
                                                                                                     5

Wetlands Advice
 Migratory Birds
Migratory Birds Conventíon Act, f994 (MBCA)
The purpose of the MBCA is to implement the Migratory Birds Convention between Canada and
the United States by protecting and conserving migratory birds, as populations and individuals.
It is the responsibility of the Federal Government of Canada (GoC) to protect and conserve the
roughly 500 species of migratory birds regularly occurring in Canada. ECCC's Canadian Wildlife
Service (CWS) provides the list of bird species protected under the MBCA, which derives from
Article I of the Convention. This list includes all seabirds (except cormorants and pelicans), all
waterfowl, all shorebirds and most landbirds (birds with principally terrestrial life cycles).
Section 5.1 of the MBCA prohibits the deposit of a substance that is harmfulto migratory birds
in waters or an area frequented by migratory birds or in a place from which the substance may
enter such waters or such an area. The Act prohibits the possession of a migratory bird, nest or
egg without lavrrful excuse. Ihe Migratory Birds Regulaflons (MBR) provide for the conservation
of migratory birds and for the protection of individuals, their nests and eggs. A prohibition
against hunting is set out in section 5 of the MBR. The term "hunt" is given a specific definition
in section 2 of the Regulations and includes attempting in any manner to kill, injure or harass
migratory birds. A prohibition against the disturbance, destruction, or taking of a nest, egg or
nest shelter of a migratory bird is set out in subsection 6(a) of the MBR.
Avoiding I ncidental Take
Migratory birds, the nests of migratory birds and/or their eggs can be inadvertently harmed or
disturbed as a result of many activities-including but not limited to clearing trees and other
vegetation, draining or flooding land, or using fishing gear. This inadvertent harming, killing,
disturbance or destruction of migratory birds, nests and eggs is known as incidental take and is
prohibited under the MBCA. Incidental take, in addition to harming individual birds, nests or
eggs, can have long-term consequences for migratory bird populations in Canada, especially
through the cumulative effects of many different incidents. For further details, please refer to the
Avoidance Guidelines at: http://ec.qc.calpaom-itmb/default.asp?lanq=En&n=C51C415F-1
Endangered and threatened migratory bird species at risk (species, subspecies, and distinct
populations) also have federal legislative protection under the Species af Rrsk Acf (SARA).
Species at Risk
                                                                                                    7
 The purposes of the Species at Risk Act (SARA) are to prevent wildlife species from being
extirpated or becoming extinct, to provide for the recovery of wildlife species that are Extirpated,
Endangered or Threatened as a result of human activity, and to manage species of Special
Concern to prevent them from becoming Endangered or Threatened. SARA supports the
federal commitments under the 1996 Accord for the Protection of Species at Risk, which
outlines commitments by federal, provincial and territorial ministers to designate species at risk,
protect their habitats and develop recovery plans as well as complementary legislation,
regulations, policies and programs, including stewardship.
ECCC has responsibilities for overall administration of SARA (ss. 8(1)). As well, SARA defines
"competent ministers" as the Minister responsible for the Pärks Canada Agency (PCA) (with
respect to individuals of a wildlife species in or on federal lands administered by that Agency);
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (with respect to aquatic species other than individuals on
lands administered by the PCA); and, the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change (with
respect to all other individuals of a wildlife species). Competent ministers have responsibilities
regarding recovery planning, protection, permitting, and other activities identified within the
legislation.
SARA sets out a process for an independent assessment of species potentially at risk and for
their consideration by Governor in Council for listing on Schedule 1 of SARA as Extirpated,
Endangered, Threatened, or of Special Concern. SARA requires that recovery strategies and
action plans be developed by the competent minister for species listed as Extirpated,
Endangered or Threatened. Management plans must be developed for species of Special
Concern.
SARA also provides measures forlhe protection of listed threatened, endangered or extirpated
species and their residences. Under section 32 and 33 of SARA, individuals and residences of
aquatic species and birds protected by the MBCA are automatically protected anywhere they
are found in Canada. These general prohibitions apply to all other Extirpated, Endangered or
Threatened species listed on Schedule 1 of SARA when they are on federal lands in the
provinces and on land under the authority of the Minister of the Environment and Climate
Change or the Parks Canada agency in the territories. These prohibitions can also apply on
non-federal (provincial, territorial and private) lands if the Governor in Council makes an order to
that effect, based on a recommendation from the federal Minister of the Environment (SARA s.
34 and s. 35).
Based on the best available information, SARA requires an identification of critical habitat for
Threatened, Endangered, and Extirpated species to the extent possible in a recovery strategy or
action plan. SARA defines the critical habitat of a species as "the habitat that is necessary for
the survival or recovery of a listed wildlife species and that is identified as the species' critical
habitat in the recovery strategy or an action plan for the species." Once critical habitat is
identified in a final recovery strategy or action plan, SARA sets out a process to evaluate
existing protection mechanisms, and if necessary, to put in place additional protection under
SARA. The timelines and instruments which can be used to achieve critical habitat protection
                                                                                                      8
 vary depending on land ownership and the species involved. SARA is designed to turn fírst to
existing laws and initiatives before contemplating using SARA prohibitions directly, looking to
federal laws when critical habitat occurs on federal land and to laws of the province or territory
or Acts of Parliament including SARA when critical habitat occurs on non- federal lands.
 ldentification of critical habitat within recovery strategies or action plan(s) is an ongoing process
and it is possible that critical habitat could be identified within the Project area within a timeline
that overlaps with construction and operation. ln an environmental assessment context, it is
important that the decision maker is aware of critical habitat information, which is available on
the SARA Registry, in the area in which a project is located.
Wetlands
The GoC plays an important role in initiatives to restore and protect wetlands. Canada is a
signatory to the Ramsar Convention, an international treaty focusing on conservation of
wetlands of international importance. A major obligation under the Convention is implementation
of principles, proposed in 1987 by Canada, for the wise use of wetlands. The Convention notes
the "wise use" of wetlands is defined as their "sustainable utilization for the benefit of humankind
in a way compatible with the maintenance of the natural properties of the ecosystem". The
federal government has also developed the Federal Policy on Wetland Conservation (FPWC);
this is a government-wide policy approved by federal Cabinet and adopted in 1991. The
objective of the FWPC is to promote the conservation of Canada's wetlands to sustain their
ecological and socio-economíc functions, now and in the future.
ECCC provides expertise in support of the FPWC implementation, which seeks to maintain the
functions and values derived from wetlands throughout Canada through a primary emphasis on
impact avoidance. Wetlands are a particular priority for ECCC because of their importance to
the maintenance of migratory bird populations for which the department has a responsibility
under the MBCA, and for protection of species at risk for which it has a responsibility under
SARA, as well as the provision of ecological services.
ECCC's advice is therefore guided by the FPWC, by its leadership role under the Ramsar
Convention, and by its responsibilities under the MBCA. ECCC recognizes the importance of
considering cumulative effects and tailors expected outcomes for wetlands to the level of effects
experienced in the area. ECCC's advice is underpinned by a 'no net loss of wetland functions'
objective and, as such, necessitates a consideration of all wetland functions which could be
impacted. Given the FPWC's broader objective of promoting the conservation of Canada's
wetland functions, the important role that wetlands play in sustaining populations of migratory
birds and SARA-listed species, as well as the commitments under the Ramsar Convention,
ECCC recommends that the Responsible Authority consider avoidance and minimization of
impacts to ecological wetland functions in project design.
The FPWC commits all federal departments to the goal of no net loss of wetland functions
(physical, chemical, biological, and socio-economic) and should be applied to all policies, plans,
                                                                                                       9
  programs, projects, and activities carried out by federal departments to ensure their interests
are addressed.
Within the context described above, ECCC provides advice on wetlands where federal
jurisdiction or programs are implicated (i.e. within the scope of federal permits or authorizations
throughout the Project area), and where there are priority ecological wetlands communities
supporting migratory birds and species at risk.
                                                                                                  10
  Attachment 2: Environment and Glimate Change Ganada's
 Environmental Assessment Standard Guidance for the Western Toad
 (Anaxyrus boreas)
 Purpose
This document has been developed to assist proponents of proposed developments, as well as
those responsible for reviewing proposed developments, in addressing concerns related to
 Western Toad (Anaxyrus boreas) that may arise in environmental assessment processes in
 British Columbia. The document provides the context for this species under the Species af Rr'sk
Acf (SARA). lt also provides recommendations regarding how to address Western Toad within
the stages of the environmental assessment process.
Western Toad and SARA
Western Toad is listed as Special Concern on Schedule 1 of SARA and is declining over much
of its range (COSEWIC 2012). One of the reasons that Western Toad was assessed as Special
 Concern is habitat fragmentation due to resource extraction and road networks; these factors
can affect the Western Toad population over a much greater area than the actual project
footprint (COSEWIC 2012).
 ECCC notes that, while this species is SARA-listed, the Province is the lead management
jurisdiction for this species. Therefore, it is recommended to consult with the province of British
 Columbia regarding baseline studies and effects assessment for Western Toad.
Western Toad should also be considered in the context of the application of the Federal Policy
on Wetland Conservation's goal of no net loss of wetland functions. Where the goal of no net
 loss may be relevant to a project, wetland functions that serve the Western Toad should be
included as part of the wetland functions assessment.
Western Toad Habitat
 Breeding Habitat
Western Toads use aquatic habitat (ponds, stream edges, shallow margins of lakes) for
breeding. They show strong breeding site fidelity, and will return to the same breeding site in
successive years (Smith and Green 2005; Bull and Carey 2008). This species also uses
communal breeding sites and can aggregate in large numbers at these breedíng sites
(COSEWIC 2012). Site fidelity and communal breeding may cause the Western Toad to only
use one or a few potential breeding sites within a relatively large area (Slough 2004),
emphasizing the importance of locating and protecting these breeding sites.
                                                                                                   11
  During the breeding season, which occurs from late April to late May depending on latitude and
 elevation, adult Western Toads spend only about a week at the water and this week can vary
 yearly within a 1 month period, depending on the weather. The egg masses are strings that can
 be easily overlooked. Tadpoles school together in big black masses that can be easily seen;
 however, these schools sink to deeper water at a certain stage of development. These schools
 can also be hidden in smaller, shallower sections of the wetland.
 Summer Foraging and Winter Hibernation Habitat
Western Toads use a variety of terrestrial and aquatic habitats during their life cycle. Western
Toads can aggregate at all life stages, including during summer foraging and during hibernation
and can therefore be vulnerable to mass mortalities (COSEWIC 2012).
After breeding, Western Toads use corridors to migrate to terrestrial habitats where they use a
variety of habitat types, including marshes and riparian areas surrounding breeding sites, as
well as forests, meadows, shrub lands, subalpine or alpine meadows, open forest patches, and
older clear cuts (10-15 years) (Bartelt et al.2004, COSEWIC 2012). These migration corridors
are important to ensure safe movement of adults between breeding and terrestrial habitats.
These corridors also provide a link between habitats; Western Toads are unlikely to move over
open cleared areas to reach their breeding or terrestrial habitat. Western Toads need overhead
cover, like shrubs, coarse woody debris, dense herb layers, boulders or mammal burrows,
presumably to protect them from predation and desiccation (Davis 2000, Bartelt et al. 2004).
Western Toads hibernate underground, below the frost line, and hibernacula include cavities
under peat hummocks and spruce trees, mammal burrows and tunnels, natural crevices, under
boulders, decayed root channels, Red Squirrel middens, abandoned Beaver lodges, logs, root
wads, and stream or lakeshore bank cavities (Jones et al. 1998, Bull 2006, Browne and
Paszkowski 2010). Most hibernation sites (68%) are communal (COSEWIC 2012).
Western Toad metamorphosis is usually complete by late July or early August. After
metamorphosis, the toadlets form large post-metamorphic aggregations at the edge of the
breeding sites. They also form large aggregations during their migration from the breeding sites
to the terrestrial habitat (Black and Black 1969, Livo 1998, COSEWIC 2012). ldentifying and
protecting migration corridors are important in order to provide links between habitats and
ensure safe movement of toadlets between breeding and terrestrial habitats.
Terrestrial habitats are important habitats for feeding and ovenruintering and the biological
interdependence between terrestrial and aquatic habitats is essential for the persistence of
populations (Semlitsch and Bodie 2003). Terrestrial habitats that surround wetlands are core
habitats for semiaquatic species and it is important to determine and protect these areas to
ensure the maintenance of amphibians (Semlitsch and Bodie 2003). Using criteria that are
focused only on protecting water resources without considering habitats that are important to
wildlife species, where many species spend extended periods of their time, creates a serious
gap in the protection of biodiversity (Semlitsch and Bodie 2003).
                                                                                                 T2
  Environment and Climate Change Canada's Recommendations for Western
Toad
Subsection 79(2) of the SARA states that a person conducting an environmental assessment:
" must identify the adverse effects of the project on the fsfed wildlife species and its critical
habitat and, if the project is carried out, must ensure that measures are taken to avoid or /essen
fhose effects and to monitor them. The measures musf be taken in a way that is consistent with
any applicable recovery strategy and action plans."
 ln order to assist the Responsible Authority in fulfilling its obligations under SARA ss. 79(2),
ECCC provides the following recommendations to help address potential impacts to Western
Toad within the environmental assessment process.
Scoping
 Recommendation I
It should be determined whether the project has the potential to impact Western Toad, either
directly or indirectly, in their breeding and terrestrial habitats. This information can be acquired
from various sources, including but not limited to: distribution maps, Conservation Data Centre
data, conversations with local experts, various databases, habitat suitability mapping, and
baseline studies. lf the project has the potential to impact Western Toad, this species should be
included as a Valued Ecosystem Component in the environmentalassessment.
 Recommendation 2
lf the project has the potential to impact Western Toad, the local and regional study areas for
baseline studies should include Western Toad habitat (breeding, summer foraging, and winter
hibernation) as part of their scope.
Baseline Studies
The Provincial Management Plan for Western Toad in British Columbia recommends
" maintaining as much foresf habitat as possib/e adjacent to breeding sifes fo allow for
hibernation, foraging, and other essenfia/ life functions" and identifies terrestrial habitat use as a
knowledge gap that needs to be addressed to determine population viability and to improve best
management practices (ProvincialWestern Toad Working Group, 2014).
 Recommendation 3 - Baseline Sfudies for Breeding and Terrestrial Habitat:
Breedinq Habitat
ECCC recommends that baseline studies be conducted for Western Toad breeding habitat that
follow Resources lnventory Committee Standards for pond dwelling amphibians (RlC 1998)
(including timing and methods) prior to construction, and include, but not be limited to, the
following:
                                                                                                     13
           a) presence/not detected and distribution of Western Toad in the breeding habitat;
          b) identification of breeding sites;
          c) a minimum of three surveys per potential breeding site per year during the breeding
              season to accommodate variation in breeding timing due to weather and therefore to
              enhance the probability of detecting adults, egg masses and/or tadpoles;
          d)  conduct surveys over multiple years to accommodate inter annual variation;
          e)   identification of migration corridors used annually by adults and toadlets to move
               between breeding and terrestrial habitat (movement is often by a large number of
               individuals simultaneously); and
          f)   identification of migratory timing windows; recognizing the inter-annual variability in
              Western Toad migratory movements
Terrestrial Habitat
Semlitsch and Bodie (2003) proposed stratification around breeding habitat. Stratification should
include three terrestrial protection zones next to the core aquatic and wetland habitats, namely
1) an aquatic buffer 2) the core habitat and 3) a terrestrial buffer of 50 m surrounding the core
habitat to protect the core habitat from edge effect (Murcia 1995). Buffers around core wetlands
and aquatic resources should therefore be at least 150-290 m to ensure the protection of a large
percentage of Western Toad movement (Semlitsch and Bodie 2003, Bartelt et al. 2004). These
terrestrial protection zones will assist in protecting Western Toad terrestrial summer and winter
habitat.
ECCC recommends that baseline studies for terrestrial habitat for Western Toads be conducted
within a buffer of 150-290 m plus a 50 m buffer to protect the core habitat from edge effects,
surrounding all potential breeding ponds within the LSA. To ensure the most effective baseline
studies for Western Toads, ECCC recommends that the maximum range (i.e. 290 m + 50 m) be
used and that the minimum range (i.e. 150 m + 50 m buffer) only be used if the habitat
encompassed by the maximum range includes those where there is certainty that it will not
support Western Toads during summer or hibernation or where other factors do not allow for a
wider buffer.
ECCC recommends that baseline studies be conducted for Western Toad terrestrial habitat
prior to construction. These studies could use methods such as habitat suitability mapping
and/or telemetry and should include, but not be limited to, the following:
     a) determination of presence/not detectedl and distribution of Western Toad in the
          terrestrial habitat;
     b) identification of summer foraging habitats; and
     c) identification of winter hibernation sites.
t EC recommends that the precautionary principle be followed where, even if Westem Toads are not observed within
the tenestrial protection zones (i.e. 150-290 m + 50 m or tenestrial habitat), but are observed in the riparian/breeding
habitat, the assumption is made that Westem Toads occur in the terrestrial protection zones and that an effects
assessment should be conducted.
                                                                                                                       T4
 ECCC also notes that Western Toads can travel distances beyond the proposed terrestrial
protection zones and can use terrestrial habitat several kilometers from their breeding sites
(Bartelt et al. 2004, Bull 2006, COSEWIC 2012).
ECCC therefore recommends, in the context of SARA ss.79 (2), that, if Western Toad terrestrial
habitat exists outside of the terrestrial protection zones, travel corridors be maintained to
connect these zones with other terrestrial habitat.
Effects Assessment and Mitiqation
 Recommendation 4
ECCC recommends that the effects assessment for terrestrial habitat for Western Toads be
conducted within the LSA within a buffer of 150-290 m (depending on buffer identified during
baseline) plus a 50 m buffer surrounding all breeding ponds identified during baseline studies.
The effects assessment should include a description of all potential direct or indirect impacts to
Western Toad arising from project activities. This description should include, but not be limited
to:
     a) the types of impact (includes the components of the project from which these impacts
         arise; effects on amphibians in the event of an accident or malfunction within amphibian
         habitat should also be included);
     b) the predicted effects of these impacts on Western Toads;
     c) the measures proposed to mitigate these effects; and
     d) the residual effects on Western Toad.
Where no impacts are anticipated, this should be documented as part of the environmental
assessment and a rationale provided.
 Recommendation 5
The environmental assessment should identify and describe measures to avoid, minimize, or
offset for each potential impact identified. With respect to this mitigation hierarchy, the
environmental assessment should describe how the hierarchy was applied and provide a
rationale for moving from avoidance to minimization to offset.
 Recommendation 6 - Buffers
ln order to address all life stages of Western Toad and avoid impacts to the species, ECCC
recommends avoidance of those activities that could destroy, alter or fragment terrestrial
protection zones. Buffers around core wetlands and aquatic resources should therefore be at
least 150-290 m to ensure the protection of a large percentage of Western Toad movement
(Semlitsch and Bodie 2003, Bartelt et al. 2004).
 Recommendation 7 - Mitigation Measures
With respect to developing mitigation measures, ECCC recommends that:
     .  Appropriate mitigation measures be put in place to protect breeding and terrestrial
         habitat as well as migration corridors. Mitigation measures may include, but should not
                                                                                                  15
          be limited to: setting speed limits on the road, avoidance of the area during the migration
         period, installation of signs to identify migration corridors, installation of wildlife
         crossings, fencing and access control measures;
     a   Mitigation measures be identified to maintain water quality, as a change in water quality
         can have an adverse effect on amphibian populations;
     a   Protocols should be followed to ensure that diseases are not spread from one pond to
         another. Please see: http://www.env.qov.bc.calwld/frogwatch/ecoloqv/diseases.htm;
     o   Mitigation measures/protocols be developed in case of an accident or malfunction in the
         construction or operation phases of the proposed Project within amphibian habitat; and
     a   Avoid formation of ephemeral ponds and ditches in the project area as they are potential
         population sinks. Human-created roadside ponds as mitigation measures have been
         shown to potentially put populations of western toad at risk of decline (Stevens and
         Poszkowski 2006).
EC further recommends the following considerations in the development of the mitigation
measures:
     .   Potential loss of habitat due to habitat fragmentation, barriers and/or disturbances or
         degradation of habitat be considered in developing mitigation measures.
     o   Avoid stocking western toad breeding habitats with fish as it can introduce predation
         where it did not exist before
 Recommendation I - Salvage
Amphibian salvage and translocation should not be considered measures to mitigate the effects
of habitat loss and mortality due to construction activities because the survival of translocated
individuals is highly uncertain (Malt2012). This can be explained, in part, by the fact that
Western Toads have strong breeding site fidelity and will return to the same breeding ponds in
successive years (Smith and Green 2005; Bull and Carey 2008). Western Toad also exhibits
communal breeding behaviour. Communal breeding and site fidelity may cause Western Toad
to select only one or a few of the potential breeding sites within a relatively large area (Slough
2004), emphasizing the importance of protecting known breeding sites. Despite the uncertain
effectiveness of salvage, this technique may be appropriate in order to reduce direct impacts to
the species and in situations where options for habitat mitigation are limited.
A. Selection of Relocation       Sites
ECCC recommends that avoidance and minimization of impacts to Western Toad habitat be the
first considerations. lf salvage is carried out, ECCC recommends that Suitable sites for potential
relocations of Western Toad be identified prior to salvage activities. ldentification of suitable
sites should include surveys to determine whether potential relocation site(s) have the
appropriate biophysical attributes for the Western Toad. ECCC recommends that the
environmental assessment describe how relocation sites were selected and include, but not be
limited to, the following:
     a) A rationale for the distance of relocation site from salvage site (travelling long distances
         should be avoided to the extent possible)
                                                                                                    16
      b)  A description of how presence of predators, such as but not limited to fish, was
         considered;                                                                               ,
     c)  A description of how the presence of existing amphibian populations and their respective
         densities (carrying capacity) were considered;
     d)  A description of how protection from potential impacts (i.e., outside the area of impact)
         was considered; and
     e)  A description of how the quality of habitat (equal or better habitat than salvage site) was
         considered.
B.   Salvage Operations
Where salvage has been identified as an appropriate option and where relocation sites have
been successfully identified, ECCC recommends that a salvage plan be developed as part of
the environmental assessment and that this plan include, but not be limited to, the following:
     a) A description of the qualifications of the biologists who will be undertaking the salvage
         operations, which should include experience developing an amphibian salvage program;
     b) A description of how non-target species will be managed, which should include
         information on the need for an euthanization program to be put in place before the
         salvage operation starts in the event that a non-native species is captured;
     c) A description of the measures that will be implemented to prevent the spread of disease
         between wetlands;
     d) A description of the potential effects of genetic mixing between salvaged and local
         individuals; and
     e) A description of the monitoring measures that will be implemented post salvage to
         assess relocation success, which should include, but not be limited to monitoring
         methods and success criteria (e.9. mark-recapture at the relocation site and in the
         migration corridors).
 Recommendation I - Cumulative Effects Assessmenf.'
The environmental assessment should identify cumulative effects of the project and other
existing and future foreseeable activities in the regional assessment area on Western Toad and
its habitat. Where no cumulative effects are predicted, this should be documented as part of the
environmental assessment and a rationale provided. ECCC recommends that identifying
cumulative effects be included as a requirement in the AlR.
Monitorinq
 Recommendation 10 - Monitoring
ECCC recommends that Western Toad be included in a Wildlife Management and Monitoring
Program as part of the E|S/application to assess the recovery of Western Toads and their
habitats post-construction and the effectiveness of any mitigation measures, and to implement
adaptive management where necessary. Some examples include: using remote cameras and
time-lapse photography to assess amphibian use of passageways and the effectiveness of the
installed fencing (Malt2O12), counting carcasses during roadkill surveys (Malt2012), using of
                                                                                                   L7
 mark-recapture methods to assess the local and introduced (salvaged) populations (Malt 2012J,
and monitoring water quality.

 Attachment 3: Environment and climate Change Canada's Support
 Services for Pipeline Accidents and Malfunctions
 ln the event of an environmental emergency, ECCC's Environmental Emergencies Program
efforts are aimed at reducing the consequence to the environment and human life or health. ln
addition to the Department of the Environment Act, the key Acts that govern ECCC's role in
environmental emergencies and that allow it to deliver its mandate are listed below.
o     Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999
.     Fisheries Acf - Pollution Prevention Provisions
o    Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994
Environmental emergencies (such as spills and other pollution incidents) need strong
leadership, clear communication and decision-making processes, as well as role clarity for their
successful management and quick resolution. For these reasons, ECCC employs the concept
of Lead Agency and Resource Agency. The Lead Agency is generally described as the
governmental authority that regulates or has legislative authority over the management of an
incident. The Lead Agency model helps all agencies involved in response efforts to organize
their actions in a coordinated fashion. The concept is flexible and adaptable according to the
source of pollution, the circumstances of the incident, and the capacity of the different agencies
involved to assume this function. lt should be noted that the Lead Agency can change during
the course of an incident. Regardless of which government department assumes the role of
Lead Agency, ECCC will assume the role of Resource Agency and provide its scientific and
technical expert support services to all partners that have requested it and where ECCC's
support can enhance the protection of the environment. For cross-jurisdictional pipeline
incidents in Canada, the Lead Agency is the National Energy Board (NEB).
ECCC fulfills its Resource Agency role supporting Lead Agencies from its National
Environmental Emergencies Centre (NEEC) located in Montreal, Quebec. NEEC personnelare
available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to provide to responders and other implicated agencies
scientific and technical advice such as:
     a   spilled material properties, fate and behaviour analysis, hydrologic spill trajectory
         modelling, atmospheric transport and dispersion modeling, spill clean-up priorities and
         spill countermeasures (including spill treating agents)
     a   meteorological, sea-state and ice forecasts and warnings
     a   scientific support team with personnel trained in emergency response and utilizing
         specialized equipment (portable instruments and mobile laboratories)
     o   identification of environmental sensitivities, areas and priorities
     o   deterrence strategies to keep migratory birds from becoming oiled, and determining
         appropriate response for the humane treatment of captured birds and 'species at risk'
     a   priority assessment for shoreline protection and cleanup using the Shoreline Cleanup
         and Assessment Technique (SCAT)
                                                                                                 20
      a     evaluation of spill countermeasures, containment, recovery, treatment and disposal
           techniques
     a     post-emergency analyses and providing advice on ecosystem recovery objectives
NEEC personnel typically provide scientific and technical advice to lead agencies via telephone;
however, they can also travel to incident scenes and provide their services on-site when:
     a     the Lead Agency or any other organization having authority requests NEEC's presence
           on-site;
     o     remotely available information does not allow NEEC personnel to determine and monitor
           if the environment is being adequately protected;
     a     coordination and delivery of EC's services would be enhanced by NEEC's on-site
           response presence; or
     a     on-site response would fulfill specific training needs for NEEC personnel.
ln fulfilling this advisory role, NEEC personnel work closely with scientists from other ECCC
programs and branches such as the Canadian Wildlife Service and the Meteorological Service
of Canada. They also collaborate with personnelfrom key partners such as the Canadian Coast
Guard, Transport Canada, Health Canada, Public Safety Canada, Fisheries and Oceans
Canada, provincial/territorial departments of environment and more.
NEEC'S Environmental Emergencies Officers (EEO) are designated as enforcement officers
with limited enforcement powers and limited Peace Officer powers specific to CEPA, 1999, and
also as lnspectors under the Frshenes Acf. lf the responsible party fails to take appropriate
actions as required by these Acts, EEOs have the authority to direct the person to take those
measures, or to take the remedial measures so that the environment is appropriately protected
and adverse effects of an environmental emergency are mitigated, if required.
lf a pipeline incident results in a spill into a marine environment, ECCC can play a front-line role
in the early detection of such spills through aerial surveillance and satellite imagery (a
collaborative program between ECCC and Transport Canada), thus enabling a more rapid and
effective incident response effort.
During the response to an environmental emergency requiring multi-agency cooperation, an
Environmental Emergencies Science Table (Science Table) can be convened by NEEC to
provide response advice to the Lead Agency.
The Science Table is not a spill response organization in that it does not involve hands-on spill
clean-up operations, nor does it own or maintain clean-up equipment, rather, it is an advisory
mechanism that brings together relevant scientific and technical experts in the field of
environmental protection in the event of an environmental emergency response. The
participants to any given Science Table can be comprised of representatives from all levels of
government, Aboriginal representatives, local communities, industries, environmental non-
                                                                                                   2L
 government organizations, and academic institutions - provided that they have relevant
scientific and technical expertise or jurisdiction over the response effort.
ECCC can convene and chair the Science Table when requested by the Lead Agency and
when at least one of the following criteria is met:
    a    The environmental emergency is major in terms of impacts/potential impacts on the
         environment andior complexity/severity;
    a    The incident has an international or cross-jurisdictional component;
    a    The need to coordinate information impedes the Lead Agency from fulfilling its response
         monitoring role.
The Science Table brings the necessary expertise together specific to the incident at hand, develops a
consensus on protection and clean-up priorities, adapts the scale of response to a particular
environmental emergency, and provides a forum for rapidly moving information to minimize damage to
human life or health, or the environment; all while maximizing the use of limited response resources.
These discussions can occur on-site, or by telephone or videoconference.
The Science Table then supplies the Lead Agency with consolidated scientific and technical
advice pertaining to environmental concerns, priorities and strategies, thus enabling and
optimizing the environmental response. lt is a flexible process and is designed to work in
emergency management structures such as the lncident Command System.

            Re: At]olication to ParticllPate: TowerllirCh Expansion Project NEE Process
            This letteri5tO request an OPPOrtunity for Northem Health to be-able to participate as a.
            commenter in the National Energy Board (NED), s review of the Towerbirch Exp,ansion project
            application. We feel that we are likely to have relevant information and expertise.that may be
            of interestto the decision makers. As well, our health services and the health of the population
            that we serve may be directly impacted.
            Northem Health provides health care services to approximately 300,000 people in Northem
            British Columbia and is the main health service provider in Dawson Creek (location of the
            closest health servicesto the project).          Rural health care delivery is complex and fragile. Any
            additional demands to this system, including demand that may arise from temporary
            workforces, must be carefully managed and minimized as to not overwhelm the system. Given
            the prop'osed workforce associated with this project, there is a likelihood that this project will
            impact health care services (including nan-urgent care and emergency care services) in the area
            and we therefore ask that we can bring forward our concems and best practices in this regard,
            many of which are summarized on c)urwebsite1.
            RelatedlyJ under the PL/b/fC #ea/fh Act, we have a responsibility to protect the health of the
            public. We know that projects, such as the Towerbirch Expansion project,'have the ability to
            negatively (or positively) impact numerous socioreconomic and environmental determinants of
            health, including those that can result from spills, accidents or malfunctilons. dn this front, we
            would also like to bring fon^/ard our [oncerns and recommend best practices.
            Based on the above, we expectthat the following issues from the List of Issues are of relevance
            to Northern Health:
                 -    The potential environmental and socioueconomic effects of the Project;
                 -     Contingency planning for spills/ accidents or malfunctions

            We realize thatthe "application to participate" in the hearing has passed and apologize for our
            late application, Since our region covers approximately half c)i the Province of BC and contains
            many approved and proposed resource development projects, it is d'lfficult for us to be aware
            of all projects and meet all deadlines. We currently have approximately 20 projects that are
            working towards receiving their provincial Environmental Assessment Certificates (EAC) and/or
            working towards meeting their EAC Conditions. We try to work diligently with a sinall office Df
            onlytwo staff to keep informed about projects and deadlines but are finding thatthis is not
            always possible. Unfortunately we were not made aware of the Towerbirch Expansic)n project
            until it was brought to our attention informally. Wewould welcome an opportunity to discuss
            howwe may be notified by NED of projects within our region and appreciate your consideration
            of our late application to participate.
            We look forward to supporting the NEE for this and future projects as part of our commitment,

  Re: Towerbirch Expansion Project NEB Letter of Comment Submission On Behalf of Northern Health
Thank you for the opportunity to participate as a Commenter in the technical review of the Towerbirch
Expansion Project NEB Application, dated September 2015.
In concordance with Northern Health’s commitment, statutory and ethical obligation to build and
strengthen the health of the people we serve in Northern British Columbia, please see our enclosed
comments and Standard Working Group Comments and Recommendations for Provincial Environmental
Assessments in Northern British Columbia1 (our Standard Comments document). While this document
was designed to support the Provincial Environmental Assessment process, we feel that the majority of
our comments contained in this document are also applicable to the NEB process for the Towerbirch
project.
The World Health Organization’s definition of health states that “health is a state of complete physical,
mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity2”. In line with this
definition, Northern Health is fully committed to ensuring the preservation of the dignity (physical,
social and mental health and wellness) of our people and the protection of their built environment
(services and infrastructure, land, air and water). Our comments contained herein are a reflection of this
commitment, and pertain to the following topics from the List of Issues that were identified in our
Application to Participate:

  Preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization as adopted by the International Health
Conference, New York, 19-22 June, 1946; signed on 22 July 1946 by the representatives of 61 States (Official
Records of the World Health Organization, no. 2, p. 100) and entered into force on 7 April 1948.
 In addition to those indicated in our Standard Comments document and Health and Medical Services
Plan guide3, key issues pertaining to socio-economic and health impacts throughout the various stages
of the project have been highlighted below. Please note that Northern Health’s review was limited to
those sections related to community services and infrastructure, family and community health, and
accidents and malfunctions.
Comment #1: Health Services
It is stated in the summary prepared for NH by NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. that “for non-emergency
medical situations, the project will minimally affect healthcare services since workers normally access
health care services in their place of origin”4. This was also stated in the Application: “workers are not
expected to use non-emergency medical services (i.e., they will continue to use the existing medical
services in their place of origin). Therefore, it is not anticipated that the Project construction workforce
will affect non-emergency healthcare services (e.g., non-emergency hospital care and dental, optical,
psychiatric and pharmaceutical services) in the SSA” (ESA Section 5; 6.19.3.1).
This has not been our experience with Projects in the region and we disagree that a workforce of this
size can be expected to only access non-urgent health care services in their place of origin. Based on our
understanding it is likely that temporary workers will access non-urgent care services in places like
emergency rooms that are not designed for this purpose. We stress that health services in the region are
often operating near or at capacity. Further, Northern Health’s funding allocation is based primarily on
the resident population; baseline primary care services available to the temporary workforce can be
assumed to be zero. Any increases in health services demand associated with the non-resident
workforce will not be within the health services capacity.
Please see Section 7 of our “Standard Comments” (SC) document5. Accordingly, it is our expectation that
companies meet the primary and preventative care needs of their temporary workforces, including non-
urgent medical needs not related to emergencies or occupational injuries as well as infection/outbreak
management and health promotion and prevention. Accordingly, we request that the Proponent
develops a Health and Medical Services Plan (as per our guidance document6) that can be reviewed by
Northern Health. While the HMSP Guide was developed primarily for industrial camps, the information
contained within this Guide applies to all temporary workforces and can be scaled/adapted to minimize
impacts to health services from workforces residing in the community. Other pipeline projects in the
area have committed to developing a HMSP, despite housing workers in communities (e.g. NEBC
Expansion Project).

 Further, we find that insufficient justification has been provided to support the claim that residual
effects to emergency health services can be expected to be “negligible” (Table 6.19-2). Overall, we ask
that the Application acknowledges that some level of “adverse” residual effect on emergency health
services is to be expected (despite the proposed mitigations) as a result of the temporary workforce
(e.g. trauma care, traffic-related accidents, etc.) especially considering the potential cumulative effects
with other existing or planned projects. The fragility of the health care system in the region should be
recognized, and any impacts to health services should be carefully managed.
Comment #2: Social and Cultural Well-being
We disagree that residual and cumulative effects to Social and Cultural Well-being can be assumed to be
“low” in magnitude and “unlikely” (as was indicated in Tables 6.17-2 and 7.2-187).
Based on our understanding of impacts associated with resource development projects occurring
throughout the North it is likely that the cumulative impacts on health care services, social conditions
(e.g. housing, cost of living, poverty, sexual exploitation, drug and alcohol abuse, crime rates, mental
health issues, etc.) and social services, especially on vulnerable populations, may be substantial. Please
see our SC document for more information. At this point in the assessment process, we argue that
mitigation strategies be developed to minimize, monitor and address these potential impacts as we
expect that these cumulative impacts are more complicated and extensive than identified in the
application.
Accordingly, we ask that a commitment is made to monitoring for and managing these effects, and we
ask that this is included in a Socio-Economic Effects Management Plan (if supported by local
communities and First Nations groups) that is scaled appropriately for the Project. We note that this has
been included as a Condition for a number of recently certified projects in Northern BC.
Comment #3: Traffic
We feel that further justification is required to support the claim that residual and cumulative effects to
traffic and traffic accidents are “unlikely” (Table 6.18-2 and 7.2-19). Further, we feel that additional
mitigation strategies and effects monitoring efforts should be considered for incorporation into the
Traffic Control Management Plan, such as restricting worker transportation to busses, installing vehicle
speed control devices, providing funding for traffic policing, etc. (which have been implemented for
other projects in the region) – particularly given that the Application predicts “negligible to moderate”
residual and cumulative effects.
Comment #4: Accommodations
While we understand that things are currently slow in the region, and that community representatives
have voiced an interest in workers being housed in the community, we stress that economic pressures
can change suddenly. Accordingly, we ask for a commitment to monitor for and manage housing
impacts if they arise.
Our concern is that increased demand on commercial accommodations can result in impacts to the
affordability of non-commercial rentals. This could impact access to low income housing for vulnerable

 populations (especially considering cumulative impacts with other projects). Can efforts be taken to
ensure that positive economic benefits can be recognized by the commercial tourism sector while
minimizing impacts to vulnerable groups?
Given that the assessment predicts a “certain” likelihood of “low to moderate” magnitude residual
effects (Table 6.19-2), and a “certain” likelihood of “high” magnitude cumulative effects (Table 7.2-20)
to commercial accommodations, we recommend that additional mitigation strategies should be
implemented and/or further assessment be completed on how this may affect non-commercial
accommodations and vulnerable populations. While the effect may be short in duration, the cumulative
impact of resource development projects in the region has been noted as substantial, and in particular,
may greatly impact vulnerable individuals.
Comment #5: Accidents/Malfunctions
We do not find that the proposed mitigation would be sufficient to mitigate health risks in the event of
an accident or malfunction. Accordingly, and given the current stage in the Application review process,
we advise that the following commitments are included as mitigations in the event of a pipeline rupture
or hazardous spill:
             o In order to ensure that water users are notified in a timely manner of possible
                 contamination, it would be advisable that an effective communication strategy is
                 established so that potential water users may be forewarned of any impending
                 contamination issues. Also we advise that this includes an inventory of all water users
                 that may be impacted (including drinking water and recreational users).
             o A requirement that a detailed post remediation HHRA be part of the Proponent’s spill
                 response and recovery plan. Also a commitment to obtain local health authority
                 agreement and approval on methodology, exposure pathways and contaminants of
                 concern prior to the HHRA being conducted.
             o More substantial consideration and commitment to spill-related long term health
                 impacts if they arise.
             o A requirement for the Proponent to clarify their financial commitment to post-spill
                 recovery and compensation costs, and demonstrate their ability to cover these costs.
Please ensure that Public Health is contacted (HEMBC and/or public health) in the event of any accident
or malfunction that has the potential to impact the health of the public. Please add the Health
Emergency Management BC (HEMBC) on-call pager number (1-866-803-0814) to the Emergency
Contacts list (Environmental Protection Plan, Annex A). Note that contacting HEMBC would ensure the
appropriate contacts and departments at NH are notified and should be considered the single-point of
contact during an emergency event.
Comment #6: Cumulative Effects Assessment Methodology
The cumulative social effects assessment lacked sufficient detail to support conclusions. It is unclear
how the potential impacts of foreseeable projects on community well-being, services and infrastructure
were captured. We advise that detail be provided on the expected number of temporary workers
associated with each foreseeable project (including the number of workers, timing and location), and
                                                Page 4 of 5
 that the assessment considers how the social impacts of these projects may overlap with the proposed
Project.
Accordingly, we maintain that there are enough uncertainties in the cumulative effects assessment and
the associated conclusions to warrant additional mitigation of socio-economic and health conditions as
part of an adaptive management framework.
Northern Health looks forward to further collaboration with NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. to better serve
our people impacted by industrial projects. If you have any questions, concerns or need additional
clarity, please contact the Office of Health and Resource Development.
