Dear Ms. Dutileerry: '
Re: TransCanada Pipelines Limited’s (“TranSCanada”) Application for i deral
Jurisdiction of the Alberta/NGTL System, dated June 17. 2.008. I
The Alberta Energy and Utilities Board (“BUB”)! by netiee dated June 4, 20I0’7, stated that it
would hold an inquixy into matters related to neutral gas liquids (“NGL”) ex action from the
common natural gas stream tran9ported through pipeline transmission systems; or processed by
facilities that are regulated by the BUB. We act as counsel for Inter Pipeline Fund (“IPF”) in
these proceedings. NOVA Gas Transmission Limited (‘NGTL”), a wholly ow ed subsidiary of
TransCanada, is also a party in the Inquiry, which has thus far heard approxi ately 28 days of
testimony. I ‘
IPF believes the Inquiry may result in a detennination of issues reSPectiI1g taﬁffs, tells,
Operations. and practices on the NGTL System. NGTL has even premised its pa icipation in the
Inquiry on the basis that “many of the issues to be examined in the Inquiry lelate directly to
facilities, services and operational practises for the Alberta. System.”3 NGT‘ " also noted the
Board intended to examine the current cenvention and alternatives to it “whi a 11 could impact
NGTL’s commercial and physical operation”. NGTL has introduced a mo 61 (the “NEXT
Model”) in the Inquiry that preposes a change to the way parties currently. operate on the
Common stream on the NGTL System with rBSpect to the extraction of N L. NGTL has
requested the NEXT model be implemented on November 1. 2010. I
As you are aware, TransCanada applied to the National Energy Board (“NEé”) on June 17,
20085 for a Certiﬁcate of Public: Cenvenience and Necessity under section 52 Iof the National
Energy Board Act and related approvals for TransCanada’s Alberta System ( “TransCanada’s
Application”). TransCanada’s Application is comprised of two components. Phase I addresses
the constitutional question of whether the Alberta System is preperly within fedI'ral jurisdiction .

and subject to NEE regulation. The purpose of TransCanada’s Appliceien is “to effect
recognition of the fact that by law the TransCanada Alberta System is no preperly Within.
Canadian federal jurisdiction and subject to regulation by the N133” Phase II f the Application
considers whether the Alberta System is required by the present and future p‘ blic convenience
and necessity and, if so, the aacillary approvals required to effect the tr sition to federal
regulation. Phase II would net proceed unless and until the NEB determines it has jurisdiction
over the Alberta System. i
The Province of Alberta has conﬁrmed it will not Oppose the relief sought - TransCanada‘s
Appl:ic:ation.2
The BUB issued a ruling on June 21, 2008, after hearing submssions from part'es respecting the
impact of TransCanada’s Application en the mquiry. The EUB stated it e ntinued to have
jurisdiction with respect te the NGTL system until such time as a conizpetent authority
detennined otherwise. The BUB also did not. see a reason to terminate the Inqpiry or adjoum it
pending an NEB decision on TransCana-da’s Applicatien‘ Finally, the Bear did not ﬁnd it
necessary to amend the scope or objectives of the Inquiry.
IPF is still trying to assess the implications of TransCamada’s Application. It believes that
TransCanada’s Application has had a signiﬁcant impact on the scape of the Inquiry and the
evidence it has presented. It has also affected IPF’s participation in the Iberta Utilities
Commission Application No. 1551990 regarding NGTL’S proposed North -_ antral Corridor
Pipeline Prejeet. ‘ .
As a result ofthe apparently conflicting views of TransCanada and NGTL and i e rule made by
the BUB, IPF believes that there is an Urgent need to have the judsdictional i, sue resolved as
quickly as possible. IPF therefore requests that the N138 eXpedite the hean‘ g of Phase I of
TransCanada’s Application to settle this jurisdictional issue and allow pantie? to assess their
positions and the possible impacts to their businesses With greater certainty. t
