§ RE: Reg ucsg for extensions of intervenor deadlines, inDI‘mQFiOﬂ. gggarding hearings
: x \- Th 3 v- “ x ' 'a ' K x x l' ' ’ ' v v

; On Nuvumbuf 24 the Naunnal Enugy Board (NEE) FLILﬁSCd Its public: hearing mdm. 7t
ammunccd thgx the deadline to apply fer intervcnor stams is December 21, 2004. The
next day the innt Review Panel (JRP) announced some information regarding public

5 hearings, acccﬁrding to its announcement, the deadline far applying as intervcnor in the
JRP public hcjarings' is December 17, 2004.

f The Arctic Incaigcnous Youth Alfiance (formerly Dene Youth Alliance) has serious
5 concerns regajding the intervcnor deadlines. It is the our position that 3 or 4 weeks is
g insufﬁcient n ‘ticc for an intervenor application given the timing of the hearing
5 annmmcemengs falling during the busy holiday season, and the particular factors present
in the North (Such as the remoteness 0f the communities).
i T

DEC—16-B4 8?:84 PM STPITUS UF NUMEN 8678738285 [3.83
l 2'
i As a result of short notice and the timing of the announcements, the Arctic Indigenous
5 Youth Allianéce anticipates that an inordinately small number of individuals and
E organizations; will ﬁle for intervenor status-~---a number signiﬁcant] y smaller than would
ﬁle othelwisé. The Alliance notes that for a I‘cccnt public hearing process in Vancouver
3 there were Otter 400 intervcnors cvcn thOngh that. proposed project was much smaller
than the prbﬁosed Mackenzie Gas Project.
' The Arctic lddigenous Youth Alliance would like to point out that while both the NEB
; and the JRP have made announcements regarding public hearings: and set deadlines l‘ur
intervenor ayﬁalications, neither the NEE nor the JRP has announced the date, location,
and duration pl‘ those public hearings. What is worse, neither the N53 nor the JR? has
l announced a Hate for when they will announce this information despite repeated requests.
Tu expect the} public in remote N orthem communities to ﬁle for intervenor status on
relatively shrirt notice, in the middle of holiday season, without an announcement
3 regarding the: dates, locations, and duration of the public hearings, or an announcement
regarding whlen that information will be released, is completely unrealistic and unfair. V
5 Once again the Arctic Indigenous Youth Alliance requests that details regarding public
V ,, M hearings be released. { , , , H U m § ,

The Allianceéfutther requests that the deadlines for ﬁling for intervenor status be set to
six weeks foltlowing the annOuncemcnt of the necessary details (dates, location, duratton)
with respect to the JR? and NEB hearings. At the very least both deadlines should be

é extendcd by tyne month. Anything less will result in a disproportionately low number ut‘

§ intewencrs ahd inadequate public participation in this, the largest develoPment project in
i Canadian histmy.

The Arctic Iiidigenous Youth Alliance looks forward to your response.

I understand that in the MacKenzie Gas Project following best environmental
practices is of paramount concern. This concern is apparently clearly
reflected in a policy statement that provides guiding principles to make every
effort to reduce emissions and use best environmental practices surpassing the
goal of simply following environmental regulations to ensure minimal
environment impact in the sensitive Northern environment.
In light of the above I have the following questions. How will electric energy
be generated for each site? What measures are taken to reduce GHG emissions?
 Is cogeneration considered to minimize GHG emissions?
Looking forward to hearing your response.
kind regards,
Oene Roorda, P.Eng.

1) Mr. Harold Geltman wishes to receive a written acknowledgement of the
16 page brief I have mailed}from both the National Energy Boara and
thgwﬁpplicgpts Imperial Gﬁl et a1.

2) The public invitation for filing letters of comment and requests to make
an oral statemen} is 29 march 2865 as it appeared in the gublic advertisement
published in the’Giobe and Mail of december 3,200é, page —7.

3) I obviously cannot come to Calgary at this point in time to participate
in a public opinion statement. owever, my name should b? put in reserve
for wanting to make an oral statement at some possible tlme in the future.

I do not want to be entrapped into a "N0 830%" scenario whereby I gm galsely

listad to appear,when I have given no such notice nor have I been xnvxted.

&) Since the matter involves billions of dollars and many vested interests are
involved,I have to think of my own security and need to gnticgpate agy kxnd
of possible "FRAMES" and other such interventions that might Jeopardlze my
written and/or era} presentations.

invested against the option of Quebec remaining in Canada and g ig peacewtime
psychological war against Canada is very we11~thought out,soph1st1cated and

in this very imgortant subgect matter. while I can aggreciate the many years 3
of waiting and the hotiy ccntested points of view he by so many éifferent g

8 CAN WE RE-IMVENT THE OIL & GAS INDUSTRY FROM A STATE OF NON~RENEWABLE
ENERGY TO ?HAT 0F RENEWABLE ENERGY?
\uﬂ' Leﬁ's start from the beginning. a
As I said in my introduction, regardless of your beliefs in the origins \_
- 0f S?ACESHI? PLANET EARTH: be it i)the DEITY~GOD, ii) SCIENCE, ~‘ ~ ;
iii) SCIENCE FICTION, there must be reasons for the orderly arrangement
of the mineral and resources wealth of the SPACESKZP.
So you really think it‘s just haphazard and random? having evoived through
unexplainable scientific acciéentdom? 1
One more time: :
Imagine yourself as the DESIGKER O? SPACESHIP PLANET ERRTH:
WHY,I ASK YOU, DID YOU PLACE THE VARIOUS QUANTIYIES AND QUALITIES 0F
FOSSIL FUEL HYDROCARBONS WHERE YOS DID:
a; under very deep depths of ocean water
b in desert sands areas?
c) in so many inaccessible northern hemisphere areas?
Was it meant to be out of our reach? Were you waiting like the heat of
THE AMAZING RACE to see if we would reach this point in need after having
consumed all of the previous exhaustible clues? ‘
WHY DID YOU DO WHAT YOU DID? FOR WHAT REASON?
Wh did gou not agﬁﬁlﬁ'ua with the appropréate OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS FOR
SPXCESHI PLANET E' T ?
Did you really éesi n all of this §ust for cosmetic fashion reasona?
Are we to believe tﬁat we can consume 311 of the SFACESBI?'S NATURAL
RESOURCES FOR AS LONG AS WE WISH WITHOGT FEAR OF EXHAUSTION OF SUPPLY?
Why would you do that? Why would you have us live that way?
On the other hand,if we are invadiné the DO NOT TOUCB ZONES, then why
haven’t we better understood this? hat is missing in your operating
'iﬁgtructions and is it already too late?
Ultimately the KEY QUESTION 18 THIS:
Does the supply of hydrocarbon fossil fuels have a direct and/or indirect
1inkage to the aafety,security and navigation Of S?&CESHIP PLANET EARTH?
By extracting too much of these hyéro-carbon fossil non—renewable fuels,
are we putting the LIFE~SYSTEM 0F SPACESHIP PLﬁNET EARTH INTO DANGER?
Again Harold Geltman calls upoh the forces ané acts of INTERFLANKTARY
CLIMATOLOGICAL COMMUNICATIONS TO GIVE A WORLD-WIDE ANSWER OF GUIDANCE
TO TEE ABOVE QUESTIONS. .

QUESTIONS:

1)What happens to the level of chemicai inter-actions when oil and gas

deposits are removed from underground seams?

2)while those deposita are in undergound {lace,are there chemical

inter-actioné taking place that we Shea d know about? '

3)do the placeﬁents of underground oil and gas deposits within the seams .

serve in a RENEWABLE CYCLICAL CHEMICAL IN?ER~ACTION ?ROCESS that relates
to something We understand and/or don’t understand above ground?

4)When we remove the oil and gas deposits are we jeopardizing a very

important undergound REﬂEWING PROCESS? .

S)Is underground oil and gas serving an undergraund RENEWIHG PROCESS,

should we try and replicate a similarity of this process above grouné?

6)14:55 skies ﬁreadings...if we push pressure unto these seams

underground with some additive ingredient,are you saying that we might
gain some additional benefit from this process?

7) Inotherwordé, can we X FACTOR some part of the undeggound oil and gas
deposits with Y ingredient and then extract without harming the
permanency of the oil and gas daposits? (SCIENCE m FICTION or my
wishful thinking?) . .

8) Is thare some kind of liguid alloy that can generate fuel fromthe
underground oil and gas eposits withjut extracting these depasits?

9) Inotherword§,what are we doing wrong to the underground deposits of
oil and gas?

10)Can we injeét some kind of product underground which wili genérate
a rausable gynergistic product? without jeopardizing the natural
value of thé oil and gas deposits?

11) What are wé suppose to be doing with the oil and gas deposits:

nothing anQ/or something we haven’t even imagined?

12) am X rightﬂto be worried that the design of the oil and gas éeposits
are inexgr-fabl%-linked to ghe.ande§gr9und immunitz system of,

SPACESHE 6.ANE EARTH and xt 18 thxs 1mmunity 333 am which glves

13) Is there a§caasal linkage between AIDS in Africa and the éevastation
of the AerCan forests?

14) What othergrelated oil & gas questions shoulé I be asking?

15) if there 13 absolutely n9 reiationship to gay of these itemsg

W%w.then how wgll I and others know that?

16) Can man inghis oil and gas actions trigger the iastability 6f
SPACESSIP éLANET EARTH-in ways and means that we have yet to understand
or is theré abscluteiy no relationship?

WHAT'S THE PROBLEM:

Our youth have been captared by a systematized computer~&
electronic gadgetry system that has tied the youth in an umbilical kind of
way to a command ﬂoat that has taken over the abiiity of the youth to learn
how to make funﬁamental nonﬂcomputerized decisions of juégment.
CONSEQUENCES: ‘

When these youth start assuming managerial positions, they are
going to find themselves in a kind of haltiess environment whenever the
situation calls fﬁr a non-cemputerized approach to problemwsolving.‘

For the third time in seven years, the: Outbreak of Violence in '
the Middle East has imperiled the economy and security of the
MU-S. audits allies.
The ﬁghting between Iraq and Iran has already shut off two to
three million barrels of Oil a day, increasing the competition
among importing nations for the diminished supply.
The loss bf Iranian production last year sent prices soaring and
brought On Spot shortages. This time, unusually high world
inventoriES provide some short term protcaion, but a sus~; ~
tained cutoff would soon deplete surplus stocks.
By now the lesson should be clear. The US. must reduce its
dependence on foreign oil and do so as quickly as possible.
Some steps are being taken. Both consumers and indgstry are .
using enérgy more efficiently, largely as a result of higher
prices. The phased decontm] of oi] and natural gas prices is
stimulating the search for new supplies in the. U.S. And the
' nation has made a commitment to synthetic fuels.

; But we still aren’t making enough use of our most powerful
energy ﬁéaponwcoal. America has enough coal to last for
centuriaéand three successive presidents have called for
greatly eftpanding our use of these reserves. But we remain .
St'ymied by environmental constraints and other roadblocks.

Ia wartime,the enéhy does everything in its capacity to disable the ability 3
of its epponent to ﬁﬁke effective decisions. We have even lost the ability to j
recognize acts of war against us durinﬁ peacewtime because the Presiéent of the i
ﬁnited States insisﬁﬁ on governing wit a “BUSINESS AS §SUAL” approach and '
I believe that Presfdent Bush is wrong to lead with that attitude. '

We no longer have the ability to recognize warniags nor give warnings that are
listened to. When wg lose tha ability and capacity to listen to naaura, welose
th? ability and capépity to listen t0 ourselves. THIS IS NOT A MEDICAL PROBLEM,

k CALL TO THE NORTH AMERICAN OIL AND GAS INﬂSSTRY FROM HAROLD GELTMAR
Make no mistake about the 20th century. The North American oil and
natural gas industr% delivered in sgaées the POWER REQUIREB T0 FUEL THE
GREATES? ADVANCEMEN OF FAMILY AND EOPLE ECONOMIC PROGRESS IN THE HISTORY
OF THE WORLD. While the fourth qaarter of the century welcomed the arrival
of a stronger foreign oil and gas presence for ﬂorth Americans the consumer
was still to benefit from the onutzme daily delivery of 011 an& gas wherever
ané whenever required. A 100 years,nothing short of PHENOMENAL.
Every oil and ?as museum in North America shoulé emphasizeithis
fact and inscribe‘thé to e of the employegs and workers that made this
extraordinary act of economic growth pOSSIbEe. ‘
Havin§ said ail of the above, the oil and gas industry,knowing its
daily vulnerabi itieawin-the-marketplace,will be the first to admit that it
cannot rest on its laurels.
SO WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?

This is a very .re opportunity to advance the public cause of the future
of Canada's Energy dastination. From where have we come and to where ghould we I
going? There are mani suggested routes to foliow.‘some are wellwtravelled and
others aren‘t so wel ~known.

Canada isn’t alane~in its choices of future energy routes. We share the
future with friends, strangers and potential enemies.

SPACESKIP PLANET EARTH carries with it a huge payload of passengers,freight
man—made inventorieg reaching into the malti triliions, hundreds of billions of
constructions , billions of members of the animal finsectfbird/fish world,if not
multiwtrillions, gnd still uncountable numbers of vegetations,rocks,minerals ant
resources. All of this is just to put this hearing into perspective.

Lamas trying to think of how I might introduce the future problems to you.
Regardless of ﬂour ova beliefs about the originator ané desi net of S?ACESHIP
?lanet Earth, 9 it i) the DEITY~GOD, ii) SC EKCE andlor iii? SCIERCEwFICTION,
I am asking you to put yourself in the position of having DESIGKEB SPACESHIP
?LANET EARTH and to be prepared to receive the foliowing questions,in the way
of introducing my bfief:

1) How long did it take you to design and build SPACESHIP PLANET EARTH?

2) What were your greatest engineering challenges and how well were you

advised in the design and building stages?

3) What are some of the choices that you rejected and why?

é) Did you think of preparing a set of 098RATING INSTRUC?IORS FOR
SPACESHIP PLANET EARTH and if so,where did you place them?

5) If you haé the opportunity to rewdo the whole experiment, would the

. design of the SPACESHIP be pretty much the same as is now?

6) What was your greatest engineering failure in designing SPACESRIP
?LANET EARTH?

7) Why did you decide to place 811 of the naturai resources where you did
in the various quantities and qualities that we have observed and
inventoried? ’

8) Why did you place SO much oil and natural gas resources in so many
inaccessible places?

9)Iﬁid you intend for these oil and gas resources to remain unused for
so many years?

10)Did you anticipate the ultimate usaga of the oil and gas resources
in the way they have been used and deployed in the past 200 years?

11)Have we the passengers failed to appreciate how to deploy the SPACESRI?
according to your expectations?

12)What have been our greatest failings as passengers in the deployment of
the oil. and natural gas reaources 0f S?ACESHIP PLANET EARTE?

13) Did you builduin EARLYwWARKING SYSTEMS indicating failure to properly
navigate SPACESHIP PLANET EARTH, and have we heard,heedeé ané found
these early warning systems that you desigaed?

14} Did Koa supgly SYACESHI? PLASET EARTH with oil ané gas so as to serve
as t e intevaal-grease mgchanism for the SPACESEIF7 If so what haggens
to the grease function i we extract too much 011 & gas? if not, an
are you saying we can extract unlimitgé suppliea of oil & gas with
no fear 0f any reprecussions? Which ageratzng instruction should we
followzthe grease function or the noﬁfear function?

35) Are the sugplies of underground oil &§natara1 gas in the Arctic region
vital ta t e performance ané operatiok 3f SPAC SHIP PLANET EARTH?
vital to the sustaining of the 9013: ice cap region?

“E33 ?ASSENGERS and CAPTAINS OF SPACESHIP ?LANET EARTH REQEIRE IMPORTANT

SCARCITY THAT RE SEE AROﬁﬂB TRE wogLD ané RA¥E WE BEEN BOIKG A GOOD

within our own SPACESKIP?

19) Why have yéu been 56 patient,waiting 80 many years, for us ,the people
to travel éuch a small attitudinal distaace? What éoes that mean
to you?

28) Thank you for receiving these questions and I wish you well in

A RECESSARY REVIEW OF THE A RIL 15,197? REFORT OF ?HE MACKENZIE VALLEY PIPELINE
INQSIRY CONDUCTEE BY JUSTICE TQOMAS R. BERGER. ‘

STATEMEET OF THANKS.

To Justicé Berger, 811 of his Staff, the participants and contribute:
to the inquiry, those that have read the inquiry reports, the many hearings,
public Jiscussions,radio & television and media reports, and to the general
auéience and public interested in the future of oil ané gas in Canada and
around the World,lit is very very rare that a report of some 28 years ago _
can still be of such valid worth and value in contemporary times while looking
toward the next 28 years. I donuthXat this says about the nature of the
issues being debated,however, it is worth my time to gresent a chapter by
chapter review with Questions for everyone to think 3 out.

While many of the questions might appear to he repetitive, I have
éecided that it is important to place them on the public record at this point
in time.

I should gay in antroducing this section 0f my own RE?ORT, the? of 31}
the briefs that I have prepared and submitted since 1985, this one has given
me the greatest amount of intellectual difficulty. ?BE PROBLEMS RHEAB OF US
ARE HUGE AND THE DECISIONS CARRY SO MUCH RISK AED SO MARY SNCERTAZRITIES.

I acknowledge that I am at a disadvantage in not having reviewed much of the

recent literature Oh this subjhgt matter,however, when browsing the INTERNET,
which I have not done, it becomes so easy to be swamged buried,inunéateé with
the volumes of matérlal posted on the hundreds of w BwéITESg that the viewer
is left with a kind of HEL?LESS & HOFELESS feeling in being ’snowed~under" so
that one doesn't knew where to begin at how to react.

All the potential mistakes that I might make are my-own.Grammatical
and typing errors are minor and easily correctihle. Judgment and factual errors
are more difficult to correct,but nevertheless that is the chance that I must
take so as to push the debate onto a new level of decision~making.

I am also not up to date on the various drilling & pipeline work
that has taken place in the past 28 years,is presently in construction and/or
being planned for the next 28~30 years in the various RORTHERN COUNTRIES such
as Russia,Norwa , Denmark Iceland and Canada. The search for oil ané gas
above and/or beiow the ARCTIC CIRCLE REGION carries with it challenges that
are history-making in every detail. ALASKA is more than a STATE.IT IS TRE U.S.A

Other countries mi%ht alga be involved in the GREAT NORTH and with
respect to the variéus PRIVA E COR?ORATIONS involved in NGRTHERR OIL & GAS
PROJECT DEVELOPMEﬁTS, your story is greatly unéerwreﬁorted and litt1e~knowt
where it should be availabie in the schools of NORT AMERICA.

Letter of Comment
About our organization
The Pipe Line Contractors Association of Canada (PLCAC) is an employer association
whose regular members are Canadian pipeline construction contractors involved across
Canada in the construction of new mainline pipeline and distribution systems as well as
the maintenance of existing pipeline and distribution infrastructure. Our contractors
provide construction services in all regions of Canada, and rely on and employ the skilled
tradepersons Who are members of the building trades unions with Canada-wide pipeline
- jurisdiction, namely the International Union of Operating Engineers, Laborers
International Union of North America, Teamsters Canada, and the United Association of
Plumbers & Pipeﬁtters. ‘
The PLCAC was formed in 1954 initially to provide a consistent representation for
contractors in labour relations matters and to establish training courses for the
development 0:? Canadian workers in special pipeline construction skiils. Since its
inception the PLCAC has continued to be progressive in addressing issues like
occupational health and safety, legislative change, labour relations, pipeline construction
standards, education, and training through one or more of its eight standing committees.
The Members of the PLCAC have been responsible for the construction of most of the
mainline and distribution oil and gas pipeline systems throughout Canada}. Included in
the projects constructed by PLCAC members are the pipeline transportation systems now
owned by TransCanada Pipelines (Alberta Gas Trunk Line, Nova Gas Transmission,

Michael L. Mantha

TransCanada PipeLine), Enbridge Inc. (Interprovincial Pipe Line, Consumers Gas,
Northern and Central Gas), Terasen (Express Pipeline, Trans Mountain Pipeline,
Southern Crossing Pipeline), and Duke Energy (Westcoast Transmission, Maritimes and
Northeast Pipeline, Union Gas system). Our Members also built the Norman Wells Oil
Pipeline project constructed from Norman Wells, NWT to Zama, Alberta, and
participated through a j oint venture in the construction of the Trans Alaska (Alyeska) Oil
Pipeline. Many of these systems were the “mega-projects” of their time. Our contractors
have the management systems and access to personnel who are capable of effectively
organizing and implementing the Mackenzie Valley Gas Pipeline Project. We have been
there.

Our contractors have pioneered, implemented, and supported the development of extreme
cold weather pipeline construction techniques, changes in safety, changes in
environmental practices and have extensive experience in the use and optimization of
mechanized welding systems necessary for today’s higher strength steel. It is a result of
many decades of involvement in Canada’s pipeline construction industry that our
contractors have been able to invest the huge amounts of capital necessary to acquire and
operate specialized pipeline construction equipment. Our contractors and the pipeline
building trades unions, with whom we have collective bargaining agreements, have
invested, and continue to invest heavily in training personnel to work productively and
safely in our industry.

Local Economic Benefits of the Mackenzie Gas Project

The PLCAC is fully supportive of the Mackenzie Valley Gas Pipeline Project. It is our
belief that the project will contribute to the economic development of not only the
Northwest Territories but all of Canada through direct and spin-offjob opportunities both
during and after construction.

This project requires the signiﬁcant support of a variety of aboriginal groups to be
successﬁal. The PLCAC contractors and the unions have an established record ef working
cooperatively with local peOples to ensure proj ects provide positive long-term beneﬁts in
communities impacted by proj ects. The most recent example of this cooperative approach
was the Alliance Pipeline project through British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan,
that involved providing meaningful employment and training for aboriginal persons
living in the regions of this project. Many of those employed have become full time
members of the various building trades unions and will beneﬁt from future work on
pipeline proj ects in other areas.

Michael L. Mantha

May 13, 2004

Page 3

We estimate that the project will result in excess of 3000 direct on-site pipeline
construction jobs for each of two winter construction seasons. Pipeline construction
workers would come primarily from Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Yukon Territory,
Alberta and British Columbia, supplemented by experienced pipeline tradesmen from
other parts of Canada as necessary to ﬁll the demand. In addition to these direct on-site
construction jobs, the project would employ many other workers in the areas of camps
and catering, logistics, transportation, equipment preparation and the like; There will be
opportunity for local and aboriginal persons to participate in direct employment,
subcontracting and the supply of goods and services to pipeline contractors during
construction. Skills developed or enhanced on this project could be used by local and
aboriginal participants to continue a career, not just in pipeline construction, but in any
number of the associated support services.

Benefits to the Pipeline Construction Industry

Mainline pipeline construction is a very cyclical business. Our contractors were
responsible for approximately 8 million trades manhours of employment for mainline
pipeline construction in 1999. Since that time the level of activity has fallen abruptly to
the point in 2004 where our industry only generated 270,000 trades manhours. As a
result, our contractors currently have highly trained personnel and equipment resources
which are vastly underutilized.

This project would have a stabilizing effect on the pipeline construction industry in
Canada, giving Canadian pipeline contractors the opportunity to continue to make the
investments necessary to maintain their ability to construct world-class pipeline proj ects.
A stable and healthy industry in Canada utilizing “state of the art” equipment staffed by
highly skilled individuals will be of beneﬁt to all oil and gas producers planning future
Canadian pipeline projects. The project could also provide the basis for our pipeline
construction industry to operate competitively on a worldwide scale, promoting Canada
and its highly skilled workforce.

The PLCAC wishes to stress that this project is of great importance to the Canadian
pipeline construction industry, to the future prosperity of Canada’s north, and to the
economy of Canada. During these hearings, we expect various groups will suggest that
such a project will bring only environmental ruin and economic and social distress to the

regions through which it will pass. We refute these suggestions. As a group, we have

constructed numerous additions to existing pipelines that were originally built forty and

ﬁfty years ago. Rarely have we seen any of the negative conditions being suggested.

Rather, we are requested to ensure that the environments through which we pass are

Michael L. Mantha

restored and preserved for future generations —— a request that we are capable of achieving
and to which we readily comply. Many of our employees live in the communities through
which we work, and we look forward to employing residents of those communities
through which we hope to work in the future. We can and will assist those people in
realizing their wishes.
We appreciate the opportunity the Board has given us to comment on the Mackenzie Gas
Project. We are available to answer any queries relating to any comment made in this
letter.

RE: Inter-agency cooperation on the Proposed Mackenzie Gas Project
Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) is pleased to assist the National Energy Board by providing this letter of comment
with respect to regulating the proposed Mackenzie Gas Project (MGP).
As you know, DFO has regulatory responsibilities to ensure compliance with the Fisheries Act in Canadian fisheries
waters, as defined in the Fisheries Act, including those in the Northwest Territories and Alberta. This involves matters
 relating to fish and fish habitat and may, specifically, touch on the timing, location, and methods of carrying on works
or undertakings in or near water such as pipeline crossings. Non compliance with the Fisheries Act is an offence
under that legislation.
We would like to remind the Board that in arriving at its decision it should remain cognizant of the fact that
compliance with the requirements of the Fisheries Act by the proponents of the MGP is an integral and inviolable part
of the overall regulatory fabric encompassing the decision-making processes. Communication between our two
organizations may be necessary to ensure that decisions in our respective regulatory processes remain consistent.
We welcome the NEB’s advice and suggestions on the best process and timing for these communications
Yours truly,

                    My name is Kenny Shae and I am from Fort Good Hope N.W.T.
           I was taken from my family at the age of 5, I say taken because I did not
           willingly go at least not in spirit. I was there from September to June for
           three years and at the end of those years I did not know Iny own parents
           even though they were standing right in front of me. Today sometimes I feel
           I still don't know them. When I was there I was there with my brother, Billy,
           along with many boys and girls from here, so I am one of many. Tod.ay 1 still
           feel alone inside: 40 years after being there. At a Residential School trauma
           program in Yellowknife I realized that aU the booze and dntgs and
           loneliness came from those three lost years of my life.
                    My mother, Corrine Shae, was a very smart and caring person who
           practiced the traditional way, living off the land and placed the traditional
           values on her everyday life.
           She spoke to me at a young age about times when uur people were very
           strong and that we had to follow our Dene law: to help those who are sick
           and can't help themselves, to feed tllose who are hungry, to provide
           warmth to those who are cold, show respect to man and anima], for we
           are equal and most of all the importance of life you cannot take your own.
           If we do we cannot see each other ever again., we all need ea.ch other to
           survive. We become weaker if Ol1e of us is gone.
                    Looking at the history of my people and the obstacles that they faced
           in life, the famine years, many people starved and families wiped out and
           again the TB epidemic that wiped out families and the changes of our
           Residential School Years, we have begun to wipe ourselves out through
           suicides, I can see how the Dene law applies and it makes sense. I can see
          how they protected their youth so they grew to become hunters and provide
           for their people (to feed those who are hungry). So in a sense, caring for
          their youth would Inean caring for your future. To me th,e Bible, the Charter
          of Rights And Freedom become secondary. The whole short sentence of
          the Dene law covers everything the Bible and Charter stand for.
                   The only difference is you apply to yourself first: you heal your own
          sickness and help yourself first before helping others, feed yourself first then
          feed others, give warmth to yourself then others, respect yourself first then
          others and most importantly your own life. To deal with your own grief,
          depression, anger and to see how important you are to yourself, your family,
          and your people.
                   Ironically, I have become a First Aid Instructor and apply some of the
          Dene law to help and show people how to help themselves and the
          importance of life. I use the tragedies of my people as lessons to be learned
          fl.-om: the passing of my mother from exposure to the cold, the passing of my
 86/85/2886   15:37      8675982744                    AURORA COLLEGE                     PAGE 83/87
           three friends in a ski-doo accident. You hear Elders say all the time things
           happen for a reason so I ask myself what is the lesson that I have learned
           from these tragedies? Could I have prevented it? Probably not, but I can
           learn from it and prepare myself and otbers to be ready. Following my
           mothers words I am blessed to be here with all of you in the same sunlight
           today
                   I see the whole system of Residential school as one of the many social
           impacts that has effected my people in my short time of existence. For my
           people raised children without the necessary parenting skills they got from
           neither the nuns nor traditional way. I know this because I watched my
           mother raise a lot of children whose parents were too young and well into
           alcoholism. She explained to me that the young ones could not help
           themselves so she had to help them, so it's not surprising when some young
           people come up to me and ask about my mother. They would call her mom.
           In my view she's their mO.t1l too. I ask: how can 3. heart show love if it was
           not shown love in the most important years from neither the nuns nor the
           traditional way? I know this because I've seen the extreme violence in our
           home and in many homes while growing up here
                  We need healing centers here out on the land where we can work on
           ourselves to free our hearts of all the anger, d.epression of residential school
           and past traumas. More importantly we have to pray for OUf ancestors and
           protect what they ha.ve left for us: Our land. We need to practice our
           traditional values, to becom.e healthy first, then help our people become
           strong in leadership and in unity to work with the government and industry
           to achieve our goals under Dene Law. We want to sit at the table, not across
           from each other~ not feeling smaller or greater than the other but as equals,
           side by side working on the bigger plan to be healthy and to grow stronger in
           everything that effects the Dene, our land, our Hfe.
                  r see history repeating itself in a sense. In the beginning, we were free
           and traditionally strong and many elders were born out there on our land. I
           know, because they showed the spot on a map, with tears in their eyes to the
           Govt negotiator during the land claims process. They put us in one place and
           said "do it our way~ your way is not good, your beliefs are no good", You
          can say they used religion to scare the hell out of us.
                  Now we have adopted their way in a sense. We put our own elders in
          one place and forgot about their traditional knowledge and Dene values. I
          wonder if anyone ever asked them if they would like to spend the summers
          at fish camps the way it was before when they were free, elders passing on
          traditional knowledge to youth and youth caring for their needs. This is
          where respect is given and received..

                   I am fortunate to have seen the changes that affected my people. I
           have seen the time that the Govem.ment said it was OK for the Dene to own
           a bottle of whiskey. Those were the crazy years the late 60's and 70's: young
           people fresh out residential school, no direction from the nuns and too old to
           learn the traditional way so they were lost in spirit. What is the quickest way
           to forget the pain of the heart? Alcohol, drugs. We don't feel the pain
           anymore. I tell you the truth, I do not want to see what I have witnessed in
           those yea.rs ever again. Parentless children in homes dirty and hungry, public
           spousal assaults, teenage pregnan.cies with no parenting skills.
                   To me, to try to take away the negative effects from the people by
           force through. restrictions and plebiscites, does 'not work and it hasn't
           worked in 30 years. I ask how long is one person going to bang his head on
           the door that will never open. You take away a bottle from one hand, another
           will appear in the other. It is better for him to realize the pain that it is
           causing and put the bottle down willingly. We have to have time to heal as a
           nation so we can lTIOVe forward in progress and. in life.
                   Self detennination: My people have practiced that since the begilming
           of time as you know it: the clock. The thing is, my people did not follow
           your time. They followed the cycle of the animals and nature. Everything
           they did was determined by the animals and nature. The animals provided
           warmth, food, and shelter. We were self sufficient, we cannot forget the
           animals, and they have to be looked after.
                  To me, self govenunent means to look after our own, to do what we
           say, to deal with any other bodies that affect our people but always in the
          Dene Law. I believe our young people proved that through the Fort Good
          Hope youth council of the early 80' s which I believe was one of the first in
          Canada. We did what our youth said, we didn't do things that were
          determined by band. council or government. We were independent, we did
          only what om" youth needed to be done to achieve our goals. We did not
          belong to anybody but ourselves and our youth,
                  In 1985, I believe that we proved self govern again in a sense. We
          fanned the WoodBlock Music Society. Again, we became self sufficient.
          We achieved Ollr goals, to have equipment, to host a festival every two
          years. We gave back to the people the traditional and contemporary music
          for everyone to enjoy. We did not focus on the negative things that affect our
          people, politics, and alcohol. But rather what is the purpose of our society
          and what do we stand for music traditional and contemporary.
                 I see history repeating itself through Treaty 11. I call it the Norman
          Wells Treaty because the Dene did not benefit from it, only Nonnan Wells
          did. My question is where is the original treaty because I would like Dora
 05/05/2005   15:37      8575982744                   AURORA COLLEGE                      PAGE 05/07
           Grandjambe to interpret it to the elders the way it was in 1921. The question
           would be: what would the elders say if they had one of their own
           interpreting instead of the priests? The reason I say that only Nonnan Wells
           benefits again from this whole pipeline deal through contracts,
           accommodations, room and board, or what is left for the Dene? So you
           could see that the Treaty and the pipeline are very similar through the
           benefits. In ITIy view, when you apply the Dene law,
           the thing is we have to focus on what's left after the construction of the
           pipeline. To use these things to deal with some social problems we have
           today, and in order to prepare for other upcoming industry projects.
           Through all the changes that affected our people, we have to look for the
           lessons in order to learn and be prepared for tomorrow for our children.
                   I believe that we are at a. very crucial point of what will become our
           history for I see leaders that say we have to follow our Dene la.w and yet
           what they do does not follow our dene law. I see a Govenlment that is
           riddled with Boards and too often their opinions are luore important than
           what the people are saying. That is why it takes months to agree on the
           simplest of things. And far too often these boards hire only their relatives. If
           these things were not true where is Startech, tlle peoples survey company of
           the 80's7 Where is Fort Good Hope Development Corporation, the peoples
           company? Where is the Ramparts Hotel, the people's hotel7 These Boards
           said they can. do things themselves without outsiders when in reality no one
           on these boards are lawyers, bankers, no one has a business degree. They
           have made us weaker.
                  In my view, it is better to have one person in the place of these boards,
           an educated person that understands law, money and how the Government
           works. And this person only does what the people say and ha.s the right to
          hire the people that make what the people say, a reality. Use the educated to
          dea.l with the educated to make our goals a reality and to ensure these things
          takes place. They will work under the watchful eye of Arthur om' president.
                  I would like to speak: about my Family Background and where we
          come from. My family name is Shae. I am the son of Baptiste and Corrine
          Shae and also the grandson of Gregory and 11arie Shae whose fall1ily \vas
          born and raised at Little Chicago N.W.T. I know this because I have some
          uncles and aunts buried there and the aunts and uncles that I have with me
          today often talk about happier times while growing up at Little Chicago.
                 I can remember times when my mother and father were on the shores
          of the Mackenzie pulling our family and everything we owned in a small
          freighter canoe, to save gas for their eight horse kicker on the way to Good
          Hope because they were taking children to residential school. I know this
 06/05/2006   15:37      8675982744                    AURORA COLLEGE                      PAGE 06/07
            because I was in that freighter canoe as a baby and couldn't understand why
            or where they were taking my older brother Billy Shae.
                   It's tough growing up in a house where a lot of tears are shed in the
            most important years of my life~ the early years. To tell you the truth~ just
            about every house shared the pain of our house of sorrow. I aln fortunate to
            have seen the tears of the parents and the children and have come to
            understand that it was not their fault that I was sent away, it was the law of
           the white people and we had to obey. For myself, I have to say I cannot let
            our tears be in vain for there is a lesson to be learned from residential school
           experience.
                   My spirit became lost and my heart W3.S within four walls, I was half
           white and half Dene in terms of knowledge. I didn't know enough of the
           white ways and too old to learn the traditional way. I am one of many. I
           know it is better for myself to leanl and understand our Dene traditions and
           values first. This would insure that I show respect and would not think of
           taking my own life; I have to continue to help my people.
           While growing up in the bush there were questions that 1 asked to my
           m.other and her answers always made sense in terms of the Dene view, "why
           do I have to carry someone else's beaver pelts if I didn't shoot it, all the way
           home?" Her reply was, "we have to equal our loads so that we move
           together, it is wrong for us to let someone carry a heavy load. Otherwise, we
           will have to wait for that person to catch up with us and we cannot leave
           anyone behind. There are two things the person can do: 1. empty his
           packsack and take only what he needs for his family, or split his load so
           everyone is the same. The end result is this we have achieved our goals to
           be home, to have the means to provide wannth and food for our f8Jnilies."
           In a sense I see some of leaders: Steven Kakfwi, Frank T'seleie, John
           T'seleie, Alihur Tobac, Charlie Banlaby and Edwin Enltse and the owner of
           the pipeline at a lake at the beginning of a 150 Ian walk on the way back to
           our tents. The leaders show that their pac1csacks are filled with all the
           negative things that came, with the changes that affected our people:
           Residential school (alcoholism), inadequate housing, and confused people.
          The owner walks with our leaders and is ca.rrying a big heavy packsack and
           so they end up waiting for him all the time because he is too tired. Our
          leaders tell hhn to take everything out, so he opens his packsack and takes
          only what he needs but has left lTIOst of the things that he needs to get where
          he is going. This is where our leaders agree to Cal1y his load for him across
          our lands providing that our people have a trauma centre for it is better to put
          the bottle down willingly rather than to be told. To have better housing for
          our families, to entrench our people's inherent rights into our land claim, to

           have our leader's actions and words reflect only the Dene Law. The elected
           leaders will reveal where they stand by their own words and it will be for all
           to see.
                   For myself, I see this as the beginning of a good relationship that can.
           help both sides achieve their goals and it is the beginning of other
           agreements that will help the people tmder our Dene law. I believe that we
           have wasted enough time on changes that do not reflect our Dene law:
           Nonnan wells, exploration (mineral, oil&gas). Only one side benefited and it
           was not the Dene even though they OCCUlTed on our lands, if the agreements
           are one-sided as the Norman Wells deal, then it will take time for everyone
           to agree and too often years. On the other hand, if the deal reflects the Dene
           Law you can build the pipeline tomorrow.

 1.0     Introduction
I wish to welcome the Members of the National Energy Board (NEB) and members of
the Oil Industry ( Industry) and Government ( Gov't ) to Tuktoyaktuk.
    •   I wish to express appreciation to the NEB, Industry and Gov't Representatives for
        allowing the opportunity to express comments on the Proposed Mackenzie Gas
        Project ( Project ).
    •   We express our Issues and Concerns, and Recommendations hoping to have a
        Positive Impact on the Project.
    •   We are trusting the NEB Panel to consider our Comments and Recommendations
        and incorporate same into their Final Report.
2.0     General Overview
Tuktoyaktuk has many years of experience with Industry Projects and we believe we can
work as Partners on the Project.
We have provided many suggestions and recommendations to Industry which has led to
successful implementation of their Projects.
These suggestions and recommendations include:
      •  Recommendations on Work Site Locations
      •   Selection of Routing to the Work Sites
      •   Project Construction including Start Times for Winter Road Construction
      •   Protection Measures for the Environment and Wildlife
      •   Involvement of Inuvialuit
      •   Building Capacity and Experience for Inuvialuit Businesses
      •   Many additional suggestions and recommendations
Tuktoyaktuk has a very high Rate of Unemployment and Residents wish for Economic
Opportunities. This was very evident when the Community voted unanimously in favour
of Concessions for Anderson Exploration ( Devon Canada) and PetroCanada.
We want Business, Employment and Training Opportunities.
 The Community ofTuktoyaktuk (Tuktoyaktuk) generally supports the Proposed Project
provided:
     •   The Project proceeds with a view to protection of the Environment and Wildlife
     •   Significant Benefits flow to the Inuvialuit
    •    Inuvialuit are Significantly Involved in the Project
                                                3
 We believe there can be a Balance between Proposed Development Projects and
Protection of the Environment and Wildlife Resources, providing Economic
Opportunities to the Inuvialuit and protecting and enhancing our Traditional Lifestyle.
We've lived with Industry Projects and are"Proof' that Industry can co-exist with us in a
positive manner.

5.0     Specific Issues
5.1     Inuvialuit Workers
Inuvialuit Workers have come a long way since the last Oil Boom thirty ( 3 0 ) years ago
and can contribute positively to Industry Projects.
In particular, Inuvialuit Workers have:
     •    Gained Extensive Experience working on Industry Projects since Industry
          returned to the Tuktoyaktuk and Surrounding Area since 2000
     •    Gained Confidence and are more vocal in expressing Comments and Suggestions
          on Projects
     •    Positive Work Attitudes and Reliability
     •    Developed Safety, Environmental and Health Standards
     •    Improved Performance because of the Experience and HSE Programs
Inuvialuit Workers are wishing to continue their Improvements and are looking forward
to Employment, Training and other Economic Opportunities.
5.2     Parsons Lake
Industry proposes a variety of Developments at Parsons Lake including Work Camps,
Production Facilities and an All Weather Airstrip.
    •   The Community of Tuktoyaktuk does not support the building of an Airstrip at
        Parsons Lake
    •   Parsons Lake is a crucial Migration and Feeding Area for Caribou and Wildlife
    •    Tuktoyaktuk Residents are very dependent on Caribou and Wildlife migrating
        through and feeding in and around Parsons Lake
    •   Enhanced Industry Activity will have Impacts on the Wildlife and therefore
         Impacts on Tuktoyaktuk
    •    In particular increased Air Traffic will result in Negative Impacts on the Wildlife
         and the People of Tuktoyaktuk
    •    The Harvesters ofTuktoyaktuk have experienced the Negative Impacts of Air
         Traffic on Migration of Birds and Caribou in the 70's and more recently, with the
         increased Air Traffic in the area
    •    Industry indicates Consultation with the Community of Tuktoyaktuk is an "On
         Going Process" to identify Measures to reduce disturbance to wildlife and
         harvesters ( Industry Presentation Community of Tuktoyaktuk Pg. 10)
                                                5
      •     Our understanding is that the Environmental Impact Statement ( EIS ) from
           Industry should Specify these Measures in detail
     •     It appears Industry has incomplete plans for Mitigation Measures
     •     Industry does not have a Time Frame for completion of details on Mitigation
           Measures
It is recommended that the Panel:
      •     Support the Community of Tuktoyaktuk and not allow the building of the
            Airstrip at Parsons lake
      •     Instruct Industry to use the existing Airstrip in Tuktoyaktuk to service their
            Requirements at Parsons lake
      •     Instruct Industry to construct Winter Roads from Tuktoyaktuk to Parsons lake to
            service their Requirements
      •     Support the Community of Tuktoyaktuk in the construction of the All Weather
            Road from Tuktoyaktuk to Inuvik
       •    This All Weather Road will provide Benefits to Industry and to the People of
            Tuktoyaktuk
5.3        Education and Training
The Inuvialuit of Tuktoyaktuk recognize the Need for Enhanced Education and Training
to participate meaningfully in the Proposed Project.
Industry will require a Skilled labour Force however Current Education and Training
Initiatives will not allow the meaningful participation of Inuvialuit on the Project.
        •    Industry projects more than 1900 Workers at various Work Camps at Taglu,
             Niglintgak, Parsons and Swimming Pt. during peak construction
        •    The Projected Number does not include those Workers not staying at the Work
             Camps but are required in some other Community to support the various
             Contractors and Suppliers
        •    We have requested Industry to supply Specific Training Requirements with Firm
             Numbers of Skilled Persons required for Specific Work Sites and Projects
        •    We are still waiting for this information
        •    Industry is currently providing Training that will result in approx. 15 Skilled
             persons by 2007
        •    Additional Training Initiatives will result in approx. 80-100 more persons with
             various Skills by 2007
        •    Construction on Industry Facilities and Infrastructure is just a short time away
             and we are not prepared
         •   At Current Training Levels, we will have approx. 5 % of the Skilled Labour
             Force available for Industry Requirements and even less when we consider
             Support Workers not staying at the Work Camps
                                                   6
       •  Current Training Initiatives are inadequate and not enough Training is being
         done
      •  We need:
              o Driver/Operators
              o Trades Personnel
              o Heavy Equipment Operators
              o Camp Cooks
              o Wildlife and Environmental Monitors
              o College and University Graduates
               o Other Training
      •  We have included Options for Training Components in our Proposals and Bids
         for various Projects however Industry usually declines these Options due to Lack
         of Accommodations Space at the Work Sites, Cost or Other Matters.
      •  Industry is sending the wrong message reo Training. A lot of talk but no
         substance and no action.
      •  Inuvialuit Workers are in the minority at Work Sites and the number of Southern
         Workers remains high and has not really changed in the last five ( 5 ) years
      •   These Employment Statistics on their own indicate Training Targets are not
         being met
It is recommended that the Panel:
      •   Instruct Industry, Gov't and the IRC to increase Education and Training
          Initiatives
      •   Instruct Industry, Gov't and the IRC to develop Specific Education and Training
          Initiatives to meet Short Tern and Long Term Requirements
      •   The Specific Training Initiatives be developed with Defined Time Frames for
          Start-Up and Completion
      •   Education and Training Initiatives should begin immediately and do not require
          the Release of the Final Report of the Review Panel
      •   Industry supply Communities, Gov't and the IRC with Specific Training
          Requirements with Firm Numbers of Skilled Persons required for Specific Work
          Sites and Projects
      •   Education and Training Programs include:
               o Short Term Training in Tuktoyaktuk:
                       • Driver/Operators
                       • Heavy Equipment Operators
                       • Camp Cooks
                       • Wildlife and Environmental Monitors
                       • other
               o On the Job Training in the North and South, and at the Work Site
                       • Apprentice and other Training with Industry, Gov't and Inuvialuit
                          Businesses
               o Longer Term Training in the North and South, and at the Work Site
                                               7
                       •   Trades Persons incI. welders, plumber/pipefitters, electricians,
                          carpenters, mechanics, millwrights, etc.
                      • College and University inc!. Degrees in Business, Sciences,
                          Petroleum Technologists, other
       •  Instruct Industry and Gov't to Identify Specific Training Targets
       •  For example, Completion of Short Term Training within a year with a target of
          X Inuvialuit trained
       •  Training is monitored on a regular basis and that the Reports on Monitoring are
          used to achieve Goals and Objectives
       •  Adjust Training Goals and Objectives as required
       •  Adjustments to be done on an Immediate Basis and not when the Program Term
          or Year is completed
       •  Require Industry, Gov't and the IRC to produce an Annual Report on Training to
          measure the Achievement of Goals and Objectives
       •  The Report to address reasons on why Goals and Objectives were not met and
          provide Recommendations and a Time Frame for Action
       •  The Report to be delivered in the smaller communities most affected by the
          Project, and not only in the larger communities
5.4      Students and Career Opportunities
We request that Industry assist in making students and communities aware of Career
Opportunities associated with the Project.
Our students understand that Industry is proposing a Mega-Project and that Tuktoyaktuk
will be in the thick of the Activity but are not fully aware of the Career Opportunities
available.
It is recommended that the Panel:
     •   Require Industry to make Presentations on Career Opportunities in the Schools
         and Communities
     •   Require Industry to encourage students to complete their Education
     •   Require Industry to provide Study Tours ofIndustry Facilities and Projects in the
         North and South
     •   Study Tours to include Students and Parents/Guardians
     •   Industry provide Work Experience on Industry Projects in the North and the
         South
     •   Industry work with Education Officials to allow Work Experience to qualify as
         Credits toward Graduation
     •   Study Tours and Work Experience be done on a Regular and On Going basis and
         not only once or twice a year
     •   For example Study Tours scheduled once a week and the length of Work
         Experience similar to the length of a Regular Shift ofWorkers
                                                8
 5.5      Cultural Awareness Training
It is very important that Industry Representatives from the South understand the Culture
and Lifestyle of the Inuvialuit.
For example, Industry Personnel should understand why an Inuvialuit Worker has great
difficulty reporting to Work in late April and May.
It's our Traditional Time for Hunting, Fishing and Camping. The weather is warm, we
have long days with lots of daylight and sunshine and it's a great time for travelling out
on the Arctic Tundra with a snowmachine.
Industry should also understand the best ways of communicating with Inuvialuit
Workers.
It is also very important for Inuvialuit and other Northern Workers to understand the
Project Expectations from Industry.
There are also additional matters that should be addressed in the Cultural Training.
It really comes down to understanding and respecting your fellow Worker and getting the
Job done safely and efficiently.
We have provided Cultural Training for a variety of clients including:
     •   Mackenzie Gas Project
     •   Shell Canada
     •   ChevronTexaco
     •   EnCana Corporation
     •   ColtKBR
Cultural Training was delivered in the South and at the Work Sites in the North.
It is recommended that:
      •  Cultural Training is included as an important component of the Project
      •  Cultural Training is provided to Industry, Gov't and Contractor Staff and Workers
      •   Cultural Training be delivered in the South and at the Work Sites in the North
      •   Cultural Training is provided to Southern and Northern Workers together at the
         Work Site or other Locations
      •   Cultural Training is provided on a Regular Basis throughout the Work Season ie.
          every two (2) weeks to New Work Site Workers
                                                9
 5.6     Traditional Lifestyle and Work Opportunities
Inuvialuit will make difficult decisions regarding Work Opportunities and pursuing a
Traditional Lifestyle.
     •  Many Inuvialuit will choose the Work Opportunities to enhance their ability to
        pursue the Traditional Lifestyle
     •  Others will choose to live the Traditional Lifestyle without working on the Project
     •  Workers may go on Time Off and not return because they wish to go "On the
        Land"
     •  Industry should not categorize these Workers as lazy or un-reliable but try to
        understand they wish to live the Traditional Lifestyle and these Workers should
        not be penalized for not returning on the next Work Shift.
It is recommended that:
     •  Industry consult with Communities and Inuvialuit, and the Workers, to define
         Time Periods for Certain Traditional Activities and offer Flexible Work Shifts to
        Workers.
     •  For example, the Worker is scheduled to report for Work on May 15 but decides
        to take the last two (2) weeks of May to do Traditional Activities. It could be
         arranged that the Worker may do a Double Shift later in the season.
     •   Industry may also offer Incentives to Workers including a Bonus for Completing
         the Season, Safety and Performance, etc. These Incentives to be communicated
         and clearly understood by the Workers.
     •   Industry, Gov't and the IRC should provide a Liaison Person for Workers to
         contact and discuss highly sensitive issues without Fear of Reprisal or Putting
         Employment at Risk
5.7      Economic Issues
 5.7.1   Opportunities for Inuvialuit Businesses
 Tuktoyaktuk has a very high Rate of Unemployment and Residents wish for Economic
 Opportunities.
     •   We wish for Business, Work and Training Opportunities
      •  We want to Work
      •  We're willing to train
      •  And our Businesses have gained a lot of Experience and Expertise in the last five
         ( 5 ) years and we have proven we can deliver Goods and Materials, and Projects,
         On Time, On or below Budget, and Safely.
 We have a few large Inuvialuit Businesses and we have many small Inuvialuit
 Businesses.
                                               10
 Industry indicates it will work with Local Businesses to help them prepare and qualify for
Project Goods and Services Contracts ( Industry Presentation Community of Tuktoyaktuk
Pg. 18 ).
Industry will also give Preference to qualified, competitive Aboriginal and Other
Northern Businesses when awarding contracts ( Industry Presentation Community of
Tuktoyaktuk Pg. 18 ).
Industry will provide assistance in the Development of Basic Safety Plans and in the
Development of Proposal Formats for Project Tenders.
That's good but we need more than that.
It is recommended that:
     •   Industry ensures Inuvialuit Businesses are Significantly and Meaningfully
         Involved in the Award of Contracts.
     •   This statement is particularly important for Small Inuvialuit Businesses who do
         not have the Capacity or Experience to be the Prime Contractor. But they sure can
         work as a Sub-Contractor to the Prime Contractor.
     •   Industry must ensure that Small Inuvialuit Businesses are involved in the Project.
     •   Industry must solicit Bids from Small Businesses and allow these Small
         Businesses to provide Proposals and Quotes. The reality is that many Small
         Businesses are not involved on Projects because they are not" On Good Tenns
         and Friendly" with the Prime Contractor. This matter has to change.
     •   Targets are set for Involvement of Inuvialuit Businesses on Projects
     •   The achievement of these Targets to be measured at the end of the each Work
         Season
     •   The Annual Report to detail why the Targets were not met and provide
         Recommendations and a Time Frame for Corrections and Improvements
5.7.2    Inuvialuit Business List
The IRC provides a List of Inuvialuit Businesses that offer a variety of Goods and
 Services.
Industry is obligated to provide Opportunities to these Businesses and will use the
Business List for the Procurement of Goods and Services for the Project.
However we and other Presenters feel there are some Businesses on the List stated to be
 owned by Inuvialuit but in fact are not.
     •   Inuvialuit Ownership and Involvement in these Inuvialuit Businesses are token
         however because they are on the IRC Business List, Industry will use their
          Services.
     •   Industry takes Direction on this matter from the IRe.
                                               11
      •  In many cases, legitimate Inuvialuit Businesses are overlooked and miss out on
        Work Opportunities
     •  The IRC is responsible for the Business List and must ensure legitimacy.
        Obviously the IRC is failing in this matter
     •  The Panel may question why we raise this matter during the Hearings and not to
         our Community Corporation and to the IRC
     •  We have without any resolution to the matter
     •  The IRC is reluctant to "fix" the problem because it could face legal challenges
        for not allowing these Token Inuvialuit Businesses on the IRC Business List
     •  We know, and the IRC knows, who these Businesses are.
It is recommended that the Panel:
     •   Instruct Gov't to honor it's Commitments and Obligations as per the IFA and
         ensure Significant and Meaningful Involvement in the Project
     •   Gov't and the IRC develop Policies for Inuvialuit Involvement
     •  Recommend that the Gov't of Canada and the IRe review the Achievement of
         Goals and Objectives of Section 16: Economic Measures of the IFA
     •   In particular provide Updated Definitions of Inuvialuit Businesses to reflect
         legitimate Inuvialuit Ownership
5.8      Community Infrastructure and Services
The Infrastructure and Services of the Community of Tuktoyaktuk will be severely
impacted as a result of increased Industry Activity in the area.
Social and Medical Services, Policing, Housing, Roads, Water Supply, and other
Community Services will require Upgrading and Additional Services + Personnel to meet
the increased demand on these Services as a result of Industry Activity.
The various Gov't's including the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT )
and the Federal Government of Canada (Canada) will need to provide a Plan for
Community Infrastructure Requirements and Funding.
It is recommended that:
     •   The GNWT and Canada work with the Community of Tuktoyaktuk to develop a
         Plan for Community Infrastructure Requirements and Funding to meet the
         increased demand resulting from increased Industry Activity.
5.9      Corporate Presence in Tuktoyaktuk
Tuktoyaktuk will be very involved with the Project and Industry should be instructed to
